1,What i find funny is the loyalty and blindness of english community. The worst possible choice for them is liberal and yet they keep voting for them every time. They keep renewing hope every election 1 year prior to it  just to ignore them at the winning speach already. Honestly PQ have more respect for english community then liberal  at least they dont lie to you just to get your vote. That being said i dont vote PQ either tired of those old man but that is another story. I mostly vote local candidate regardless of party even voted liberal once.. Outch that was hard to admit. But seriously guy's drop the act anti PQ anti QS dont vote for CAQ cause they dont win etc.. Any of those will at least respect you when they say no. And most of time they will say yes and ACT on it not just saying it like liberals do.,0
