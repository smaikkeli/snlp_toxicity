1,As in all professions  people cannot all be "lumped under the same umbrella". Many doctors work long hours and do not receive huge salaries. But they tend to be the younger ones  who are just starting in the profession. The older  more established ones  however are very well paid (as they should be) and often no longer work the same brutal schedule (unless they choose to). I know a GP who lives a very privileged lifestyle  who hasn't done any "on call" work for over 15 years  and has only worked 4 days a week for the last 10. And I don't begrudge him that lifestyle - he's earned it. But I still think he should pay his fair share of taxes. He can afford it.  All citizens  regardless of their profession  should receive the same tax treatment. And loopholes available only the rich  need to be closed in order to keep everybody' tax bill affordable.,0
2,IREPthe 541: " On another note Kitty Piercy has done nothing......"     what was the first note?  you started on a tangent and went sideways from there.  did they delete half the story ?,0

5,Nice job you two! Such a beautiful section of the Chugach...so much to see...even if you cruised through it in only 22 hrs 10 minutes! Aaron Thrashers' recent solo accomplishment is nothing to laugh about  either. How lucky we all are to have such aesthetic mountains out our back doors! Keep pushing those imaginary boundaries! Thanks  Beth  for the great story!,0

10,You definitely would probably need the services or to use some kind of an on line tool because there is going to be projections that you are definitely going to have to be doing but really when you are looking at how much you need to retire there are  it is kind of a simple equation that you start out with.,0
11,Yes  Thank U   we need new multi-faceted approaches: Counseling  Training & Support for Higher-Income Jobs- and immediately  a safe place to stay. As you are well aware  as the sweeps continue on the Town side  the Homeless population is growing in places like Windward-North Shore  - but Homeless serves are limited.  Key Leadership in both the Ko'olaupoko and Ko'olauLoa Hawaiian Civics Clubs have said people born in their areas  should be Housed in their areas. There are smaller Non-Profits with land and Churches that want to host Houseless; but are struggling with the our government bureaucracy and permits.  Up our rural side  Housing with AG training-work programs is being proposed by both Churches & Non-Profits.  More grassroots involvement  support & training is needed to see what works in different areas.,0
12,Ford was a washed-up crack addict. He didn't care for the common person any more than trump does. You can use all the buzzwords and talking point you want  but a pig with lipstick is still just a pig.,1
13,Bigot  the british invaded Canada  and france did nothing to help.  and you are a divisive arrogant bigoted jerk who is breaking up the country.  The battle isnt over.  The 258 year old struggle will end in a Canadian Republic.  Vive la république!!!,1

17,It is true that the car is one of the last bastions of control over large machinery will have  and some of us will miss that interaction. He captures the joy of driving which will draw a portion of future generations to it they way many younger people are drawn to vinyl. We need a debaters episode on whether Canadians have a "drivers licence or license" or " does Subban play defense or defence" and does it matter.,0
18,And that is the problem.  Voters need to care about the fiscal reality this Province is in.  The current debt is unsustainable  and is already eroding into services we really need (like Healthcare).,0

25,Ms. Hunter  I'm calling foul on this one. In one paragraph you quote Mr. Horgan as saying that he intends to stop all union and corporate donations when his party gets elected in May. Then you close the article by saying that neither Horgan nor Clark intend to stop union and corporate donations.  That's contradictory reporting   IMO.,0
26,This payout or bribe had very little to do with the "rule of law" as you say. It was for some other reason  pandering to a voter base perhaps or simply being an idiot  who knows.,1

29,No  it's Europe that can't be trusted. They're letting themselves be invaded by the muslim hordes.  Would they even be "European" 30 years from now at this pace?  Time for America to save Europe from themselves.  Elites  suck it.,1

39,Fortunately it doesn't take a lot of work to spruce up old cemeteries a bit. A little landscaping would do wonders. Around the country some are going as far as reconditioning the head stones by sand or soda blasting then polishing them. In this area the biggest headache is keeping them mowed or big weeds will take over but mowing monthly will not break the bank.,0
40,I've got an inflatable kiddy swimming pool.  Will that do it?,0

42,So says him.  And what exactly is different that we are doing now that we were not doing before?  Do you even know?,0
43,Could never understand what all the hype is about Cataluna. Well  a big part of it was she was put on a pedestal by the former Advertiser editor who  if I recall correctly   she was dating at the time. And he pushed her stories to the top. I always thought she was mediocre. By the way  what a stupid misleading headline.,1
44,Take a deep breath and GET OVER IT!,0
45,The question is: did he break American law? A Canadian Prime Minister's company was involved with an 'off-shore tax free country' but did not breach Canadian law. If this man or any other Trump appointee is as unprincipled as claimed  then Trump will be cast out at the next election. Those who voted for Trump expect reform in the Washington swamp and if these expectations are not met  they will vote for someone who is better suited to the task.,0
46,Oops  you are right: http://whispersintheloggia.blogspot.com.au/2005/09/oh-no-not-more-cape.html Well  what can I expect after his dopey mishandling of the new translations of the liturgy. He is a stupid man. However  that does not make him a pedophile sex offender.,1

50,"After campaigning on a promise to clean up Washington and rid it of special interests  Donald Trump has stacked his team with the likes of former Goldman Sachs banker Steven Mnuchin and ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson. Now  just weeks before taking office  Trump has decided to sideline his pledge to “drain the swamp ” his ally Newt Gingrich said Wednesday. “I’m told he now just disclaims that ” Gingrich (R-Ga.) the former House speaker  told NPR’s “Morning Edition.” “He now says it was cute  but he doesn’t want to use it anymore.” Gingrich posted to Twitter this week what he described to NPR as “a very cute tweet” about the alligators in Washington. But someone ― Gingrich didn’t disclose who ― sent him a note saying they were tired of hearing such talk."  Awww. Isn't Trumpski cute?,0

58,Render unto Caesar also means obey the laws.   To break immigration law is a form of stealing.  No forgiveness is necessary.,0
59,Industrial policy via Twitter will not work in the long run. Stories like this grab headlines but there are thousands of companies and jobs in the U.S. that are being created or destroyed every day and it's impossible for Trump to intervene in every situation. And untangling what's made inside and outside the U.S. would be a herculian (and perhaps impossible) task. Practically all manufactured goods imported from Mexico  for example  has American content.,0
60,How can you seriously support this JOKE of a "President"?  The man is a bafoon and nothing more than a reality show wannabe.  I wish Palin would have been President over this idiot.  To support this lunatic says something about ones character in my opinion.  A complete embarrassment to the U.S. and on an international level.  The U.S has become a laughing stock globally.,1

71,i'll be darn you wouldn't think that close that it would be different,0
72,Oh Bullshit. Go look at the most gender equal country on earth (that would be Iceland) and you'll find that the partriarchy has not been replaced by the state  it has not been replaced by ANYTHING. People just fail to expect anything from each other based on gender and double standards don't exist.  And contrary to stupid claims elsewhere in the comments: guess what else has ceased to exist: any kind of paygap.  The biggest downside Iceland has faced is that  not having any double standards or judgement of people's behaviour their enjoyment of daily casual sex has given them a rather higher than average rate of Chlamydia (known locally as the 'Reijkjavic handshake') one of the few STDs you can fairly easily catch even when using condoms.  But then  it is also one of the easiest to cure and with an excellent free-for-all healthcare system it's really not a major problem.  If that's the biggest price for a society where rape is basically non-existent  I would pay it with glee.,1
73,You let the union contract expire and then make them compete with private contractors for future contracts.  There is no law saying you must use public employees for services.  I worked in healthcare for many years and when departments were no longer profitable they replaced those employees with outside service companies.,0
74,This is suck bullshit.  Who picks the fruits and vegetables that we buy everyday at the grocery store?  Do these generally transient illegal immigrants not contribute?  They earn minimum wage at best  receive no health care.  Why are these people the enemy and not corporate America that doesn't pay it's share of taxes  lobbies to minimize competition and is never held accountable for their actions.  It's always easy to point the finger at those that can't defend themselves.,1

79,the need starts with how easy guns are sold. Obviously the present gun laws have cracks in them. Yes there is black market gun sales to spoil the world. On the other hand. Wasn't our nation founded on the rights of of the whole group not individuals.   This is the 2nd Amendment.   A well regulated militia  being necessary to the security of a free state  the right of the people to keep and bear arms  shall not be infringed. Now call me crazy but it sounds more  like the  way it is worded sounds more like to bear arms to be ready to fight as a army.,0

86,Fiscal conservatism like Chong or O'Toole would work which were more moderate  but Bernier agreed was too extreme.  While there are good reasons to transfer health care to the provinces as that way it would get rid of the finger pointing and you could hold someone accountable when things go wrong (I think health care should be done by one not two levels and having the feds take over I would support but would require a constitutional amendment so not realistic).  I think politically though it would never fly.  It wouldn't mean the end of health care as any provincial government who did end it would see their party annihiliated in the next election.  Likewise Britain getting out of health care in Scotland  Wales  and Northern Ireland didn't end it  in fact those three have less private sector involvement than England does ironically  so the idea is fine  but selling it politically no way.,0
87,Repeated price drops??? Only those properties that were listed way too high to begin with. Too many greedy sellers who all want over $1.3 M for their houses.

103,Interesting point. So tell me exactly how bad it has to get before a given individual is entitled to a government rescue. A category 5 storm? A tropical storm? And is it sufficient to be only indirectly impacted  or is a direct impact required? And how many "violent criminals" have to be outside your door? Isn't it normal in many of these places to have violent thugs just outside the bounds of the resorts? And why are people going to places like that anyhow?,0

110,The message should simply be that you need to understand both income and expenses today and in the future  and make a plan to close the gap or to adjust your life style. Otherwise you'll be dependent on the state for your retirement  unless of course you're fortunate to have a DB plan.  Most folks don't get this  or clue in only a few years before they want to retire and panic. You need to have a plan and put it into play mid thirties  because it will take a few decades for it to happen.,0

112,Where is DOT Harbors in all of this?  This is the second incident in a week at the fishing piers.  More vigilance may be needed by DOT in monitoring potential incidents  and with notifying tenants.  If this happened at the foreign crew piers  things could be a whole lot worse!,0
113,The benign effects of the financial crisis in Canada that reduced consumer borrowing in the US increased it here.  Low rates  but a healthy gap between funding levels for banks and prime rates meant huge profits form retail.  The banks pushed us all to borrow with slogans like "you are wealthier than you think".  I once heard a bank treasurer imply these spreads represented over 100% of their profits the prior year.  And so it is ironic that the banks are now among those heeding the debt level warnings.  There can be no explanation other than that they cannot wean themselves off it and need OSFI to help.  It is game theory run amok when an oligopoly needs someone outside the game to impel them to change the way they play.  With house prices up as much as they were over the year  even those that in a 250 basis point rises may have a little wiggle room.  I note that no one is estimating the price sensitivity of the real estate market to the move.  that would be a good piece of work.,0

120,The plethora of UK consumer price indices is confusing : the UK CPI rose from 2.7% in April to 2.9% in May  as opposed to the CPIH  up from 2.4% to 2.5%  the RPI  up from 3.5% to 3.7%  and the RPIJ  up from 2.8% to 2.9%. The latter is just the RPI adjusted to remove the so-called formula effect which gave the RPI an upward bias. It hasn’t been calculated since the January 2017 update  but since the impact of the formula effect on the RPI annual inflation rate is still published  for all intents and purposes the ONS still publishes the RPIJ annual inflation rate. The RPI/RPIJ should have been reformed to include stamp duty (i.e. land transfer taxes)  heavily influenced by rising house prices  but this still hasn’t happened. If one added a stamp duty component to the RPIJ  it might already be showing a 3.0% inflation rate in May. The true rate of inflation as far as UK households are concerned is probably already at or above three percent.,0
121,Thank you  Sprietsma  for your wise words. You are just a little younger than my parents  born in 1920 and 1926.  Yes  I agree with your statement  "if dying is just a part of the process of life  and that is the way God arranged it  it must somehow be a 'good' thing."  But another aspect of death is how it affects our relationship with other living creatures. We are so easily made to overlook our complicity in the deaths of others  who have as much right to live as we do; it is the way of wisdom to pay attention to the lives of these countless cousins of ours  and never do anything to make their deaths more painful than they are.  So on the matter of assisted suicide  I am confident that sick people with no hope of living much longer do a good thing  to spare themselves more pain and their loved ones inconvenience. And those who assist them also do a good thing  by being their ministers. It's much better than the unreal  inhumane demands of modern medical "life-saving" practices.,0

127,Without going to dynamic pricing  there could be timed pricing for busier times.

130,I think Rob has missed the point here by recommending  GIC and DI buyers consider other financials for their money. If you buy a Canadian dollar GIC with a term of 5 year or less  in an amount of $100 000 or less your money is guaranteed by the CDIC  a Federal Agency. This is the same guarantor providing underpinning for the major banks and  provides a guarantee that your capital  as above  will be preserved.  If push comes to shove  the CDIC may send your GIC and others along to a major bank along with a bundle of mortgages. Then you will have a Major bank GIC at a much higher rate than if you buy a bank product now. If this smooths out  you'll have a high rate GIC at Oaken.  The 5 year GIC rate at home Bank and Home Trust is 2.5%. I bought another one this morning.,0

He's doing what anyone in his position should be doing; Trying to get the best contract possible.  That and  knowing Patty Roy's attitude  can you honestly say he didn't make some crack about his size in his dismissal last year? I know I can't.  On top of that  the kid knows the Avs have turned 180 and are interested.  It only makes sense to see what else is out there with a safety net like that.  This IS the kid's career we're talking about here.  Let him play the field; It says nothing of his character at all.,0

Who’s that hodaddy with the crumby looking board?    2.  n. an obnoxious person; a repellent person. (California.) Ted is a total hodad.,1
144,Wow  how embarrassing for Loretto Jones. How dumb do you have to be to drive up and pull signs out of peoples' yards in the middle of the day?,1
145,We weren't in a good spot.,0
146,This is a really simplistic explanation of the 60% No vote. There were lots of reasons for opposing Renzi's constitutional amendments. Large sections of his own party broke with him and participated in the No campaign  as did most of the Italian trade union movement and political left.,0
147,Worst ever?  Perhaps but  if so  likely a record to stand but a few weeks.   Then you'll get to have a close-up look at what the unions got you to put in place to take his place should one-term Willie go away.,0
148,Define "left" media?,0
149,Love this article.  Absolutely nailed it. Thank you Denby,0
150,Never forget how Reagan continued that "Southern Strategy" by pandering to the racists at the moment he announced his candidacy in Mississippi:   "Critics claim that Reagan's choice of location for the speech (the fairgrounds were about 7 miles from Philadelphia  Mississippi  a town associated with the 1964 murders of civil rights workers) was evidence of racial bias.  During his speech  Reagan said:[1]  “ I still believe the answer to any problem lies with the people. I believe in states' rights. I believe in people doing as much as they can for themselves at the community level and at the private level  and I believe we've distorted the balance of our government today by giving powers that were never intended in the Constitution to that federal establishment."  That was all code for allowing Jim Crow laws to be put back on the books and for the traditional racism of the Southern States to be legitimized. LBJ lost the south but the GOP lost the soon to be majority of colored voters.,0

152,you live in a delusional world     here utilities are scam corrupt inefficient systems based on politics not reality  and people like SOROS are lobbying against us fixing the problems.. DUMB GREED!   canada needs to get out of the way of business and let this happen  it does not need to spend tax money to do it loser   and save the smart grid bs  we already have a grid from coast to coast  the smart grid is a fantasy of the left to justify more government,1

158,You know what's dumb? This is dumb -- announcing your discomfort with paying your workers $190 million in two years as a result of a higher minimum wage  while announcing profits of more than $350 million in the previous quarter.,1
159,Your statement  "Let us remember that over HALF the American population voted for Donald Trump." is in error. (aka a bald-faced LIE!).  54% of the voters voted for someone OTHER than T-rump. (You can look stuff UP  you know!)  And only 57.9% of eligible voters voted in 2016. And only 231 556 622 OF "the American population" were even ELIGIBLE to vote.  No wonder America is in such a conundrum. People like you cannot do basic math  thus proving Shakespeare correct when he wrote  "Ignorance is the curse of God; Knowledge  the wings wherewith we fly to Heav'n."  Or  as they say in the South  "Get some learnin'.",0

165,The inventor of the AR-15 himself  Eugene Stoner  has repeatedly stated that the AR-15 was never meant to be owned by ordinary people.  It was designed to be a machine of war.

168,Trump anything is a disgrace and Donald Trump Jr is the biggest disgrace other than his father. I like Kahn's response when informed of this ridiculousness.,1
169,To all you idiotic naysayers: OK  let's play ... say climate change isn't being caused by (stupid) human activity (hmphh)  does it not behoove us to do EVERYTHING we can to mitigate any possibility that it might people?  I'm not saying we can fix it overnight  but we're one of the earliest generations of a huge industrial revolution  and can set the tone for environmental stewardship for future ones.  Or are all you lazy minded morons content that we can just happily continue to pollute the atmosphere  greedily mine and drill  massively over-fish the oceans  and dump millions of metric tons of trash into it and landfills on a daily basis? We're already tragically late! Ever hear the saying  "leave a place in better condition than the way you found it".  You're the types that go to house parties and don't stick around to help clean up your mess.  Your unbelievably stupid selfish and dismissive attitudes towards the environment and even your own family's futures are just beyond stunning.,1
170,if it was Obama should have done the same.,0
171,Can you understand that some may consider your attitude ignorant and thuggish  Brian? Whe should members of the media be accustomed to having their "butt kicked"?,1
172,Hannity is such a sleaze bag that I dont care if people are unfair. He is supporting a lying racist president who is clearly a Russian stooge. He deserves no respect or fair shake of the dice.,1
173,For some reason your post shows up as a response to my comment... in any event  I  too agree  that the supplier issue is the problem.  But my question was not rhetorical. What ulterior motives to animal rights activists have in banning retail sales? That is the only element in the McFea post that  stopped me from hitting the "like" button. This is a bona fide request for information.,0
174,No problem. Here's what you should do. Just include this note the next time you donate to the fund:  "I want to make it clear that my contribution is to be used for habited nuns only. I realize that these days most of them are young  and that the elderly ones who wore civies are those now in need  but I don't care. It doesn't matter that they were the generation risking their lives serving people in places like El Salvador and inner city Chicago. They aren't real nuns in my book and  as far as I'm concerned  they can rot. No habit  no coins from me. Capiche?"  That ought to do the trick.,0
175,We used to "kill" each other by pointing sticks at each other and acting like they were guns  bang bang! We never found something that we thought was poison to put into someone's food. These kids need serious punishment to be taught that this behavior is way beyond "play".,0
176,Good point,0
177,You people are despicable.  I'm not a Hillary fan but saying the woman is lying because she doesn't feel well is about as low as it gets.  Are either of  you aware of the recent weather reports from the east coast?  Hot?  Humid?  That type of weather can make anyone ill - even a Presidential candidate.  Shame on you.,1
178,Thanks  Chad.  Democrats and Republicans are not that different  as it relates to party entry.  Voter apathy may relate to a slate of party candidates that are not seen as making any difference in our communities or our state.  Without both parties giving due attention to vetting we will deal with misrepresenting of candidates and their opponents.  Perhaps party vetting starts with volunteering for party activities within our communities  and sponsorship through a party member  and review  of party applicant's application for membership by a trio of members representative of membership.,0
179,No  I can't. I doubt it's true  but I'm willing to give you the chance to show it is.,0
180,That trick will only pull off if the person sitting in the interview is truly clueless of what's going on.  No amount of acting or lying can pull that off.,0

182,well no he was just a jerk he put uh he put the blame on everyone but himself he went out and you know bought uh bought recruits,1
183,Why would you extrapolate that experience to all bicyclists?  Sounds like you met a rude person who happened to be on a bicycle.  Perhaps you could have some sympathy for polite bicyclists. :-D,0
184,Respectfully RADIRD  I have always been polite to others on here  taking even extra regard for those I disagree with  and they threatened to restrict me for not voting on others comments as they would like! I just went on to a better national publication that employs DISQUS  one that reports directly on events in congress and Capitol Hill. an left this hedge fund owned  suburban emotional appeal rag  one that had to leave Denver for Adams County because things are getting so sad  to enjoying now the comments from hundreds  and often thousands  around the nation on any given article.    CIVIL is sad. The Denver Post aka: Adams County Enquirer  not only suffers from very poor journalistic quality today  having canned anyone they had of note  but are destroying the one asset they really had  community interaction and involvement on these boards!       It's like the wheel in their head is spinning away  but the hamster has died long ago! They've hit rock bottom and are now starting to dig!,0

190,Canada could bring 60000 refugees to Canada. We acted very bravely under Justin 2 years ago regarding the Syrian refugee crisis.,0
191,For instance  the more egregious ones even McLean's had to remove from their website - too late. They called them «errors of fact» (ha ha ha ). But they still saw fit to publish them in the first place. Some years ago McLean's published an article by a U. of Calgary emeritus prof of history  which stated that the acadian expulsion had never happened (he wasn't debating «causes» - which would be fair game - no  he just asserted the whole thing was made up).,0
192,Anybody willing to take a look at my SOP would be greatly appreciated. Didn't make it to the interview last year so I've been writing and rewriting a whole lot.,0

196,Drumpf most certainly has the right to declassify any information.  He also has the right to show that he is a dumbkoff and proves t almost daily.,1
197,Bike users also do far less wear and tear on roads than cars  meaning that switching from a car to a bike saves the taxpayer money in the long term  even if greater bike usage requires building new bike lanes or converting mixed-use lanes to bikes-only. And bike riders already "pay to play"  as automobile-specific taxes such as gas taxes and registration fees are not sufficient to pay for road maintenance etc and much of the costs are picked up by other general taxes that bikers do pay.,0
198,Since you're so concerned about Austria turning "fascist"  maybe you should dress up in your little black-hooded AntiFa suit and go shut down Austrian right-wing free speech like a good fascist would.,1

202,This lady is so liberal it makes me sick,1
203,The only part of what you write I disagree with is that you make no mention of the fact that the fees that the merchant pays are being added to the prices we pay.  The perks you receive are simply a partial refund of the higher prices you pay.  Cash and debit card users are getting shafted worse. They are paying higher prices and getting no perks.  In the meantime the credit card companies are making many billions for doing nearly nothing.,0

208,and again the lunatic lefty has no clue what the swamp is    no its not the cabinet you idiot  its the career overbloated bureaucracy of political hacks and all the over blown regulations they create that inhibits society     you are a text book of ignorant,1
209,I have read the Constitution  apparently a lot more than you have  and no where in it does it exempt the President from following it. Being secure is a fundamental human right  not a social service. So say say homeless people are pretending to be refugees in order to access social services in a illogical statement.,0
210,bubblegum 1 - sounds like a frat brat,1
211,The point may well be that people didn't vote for Trump because of his demonstrated maturity.  In fact  his lack of emotional and intellectual maturity may very well be what made him such an attractive option.   If that is the case it reflects dismally  and discouragingly  on the US  the voters  and democracy in general.,0
212,It is clear that Stephen Harper wanted all aspects of Canadian society represented in his Senate appointments...even the bizarre and hard-to-believe end of the spectrum.,0
213,Outsider77:  REALLY  "few people have direct experience with crime".  Do you not watch  the tv news  read the NEWS paper  news on the internet?  For approx. the last several years now there are almost daily stabbings  robberies  murders  domestic violence  in Eugene.    Go to the Eugene Police Dispatch daily report  hundreds of daily crimes.  You have a different interpretation of crime and how much of it there is.,0
214,nah incorrect unless you call them bad drivers for not having snow tires on. Most seem to like the all season which all manufactures say are only for light snow and not adequate for ice. The State needs a law requiring snow tires during winter as Canadia does. I drive the glenn daily and saw all the wrecks and people calling in saying it was extremely slick which I agree if you don't have snow tires on. I had no issue this morning and run non studded I Pikes  lots of siping to grip the snow and ice.,0
215,It's just the man-hating  man-bashing feminists waging their Gender War tactics to overthrow western men and western civilization.... and replacing it with macho eastern men and liberal eastern civilization ..... and contradicting themselves to satisfy their orgasmic feeelings .... soooo obvious...!,1

217,Garbage after garbage after garbage here at the good old Gloob  but nothing about the recent  if not yesterday  announcement by Kevin Flynn to help the hundreds of sick workers who got sick from exposure to 3000 toxins at the G.E. plant in Peterborough. Pathetic.,1
218,What's the point of this story?,0
219,They'll never understand that. they were only shown how to feel about voting for a black guy. I know pathetic but it happened. it's just like how some women vote for a VAG just cuz it's a VAG and not because they are best for the job... I know I am way beyond politically correct but that doesn't mean I am wrong or lying does it?...,1
220,Alaska doesn't need a gas line to save it's economy... the corrupt bastards club will just end up giving the gas away like they have done with our oil. There's no hope unless they all get voted out of office and stiff conflict of interest and open meetings laws are reanacted by their replacements. That can only happen when voters get sick of the status quo. Had enough yet Alaskans???,1
221,These poor people a pawns in a cruel political game. Obama opened the doors  invited their parents in by promising to make their lawbreaking legal  and later "rewarded" their children by making Dream Act  previously rejected by Congress  into executive order - DACA. He & Dems had nothing to lose in this cruel game that has nothing to do with compassion  and here's why. If Hillary would've been elected  she would continue it and kept flooding the country with Democratic voters. If a Republican won  as he did he would have a mess on his hands  had to cancel DACA  which he did  and face the backlash of the big chunk of compassionate American voters  and endure riots by angry ( Who can blame them? The were lied to) Dreamers. A win-win. It was all planned. Now Obama and his party can sit back  pretend to care  and enjoy the scenery of angry youth hating on current president who had nothing to do with false  illegal promises of the previous administration. Dreamers should take Obama to court,0
222,You  can't  fix stupid   19 years  of  idiocy  and   counting.,1
223,You have an opinion on the matter; "ilk" refers to the people who share your opinion. I do not have an opinion on the matter but I do suspect false narratives when I hear hyperbole used.  Best wishes.,0

227,Mr. Spicer is working hard to become every bit the imbecile and pathological liar that his boss is.  That's a heavy lift  but he's trying!  They both seem to believe that no one they speak with every studied history.  Hitler  of course  used chemical weapons every day of WW2.    Plus  Mr. Trump is a psychotic.  There's that too.,1

232,No Medicaid.  It's nearly always an annual assessment (i.e. full year coverage).  It doesn't matter if the 1.3M people aren't the same 1.3M every year.  The point is that over 1.3M (nearly a fourth of the state's population) is TOO MANY.,0
233,If Trump interrupted everything he did in this country every time the military bombs someone  he wouldn't get a lot done.    Most Presidents have announced their military strikes after the fact.    Clinton's killing of the Pharmaceutical factory in Sudan which 'intelligence' said was a gas factory  his attacks with cruise missiles at the same time on Saddam's 'weapons of mass destruction' were the subject of an oval office speech.  What he was eating while those attacks were going on was not revealed.  What was Obama eating during his 473 Drone attacks as of December 2015?  "Between 2009 and 31 December 2015  the administration claimed that it launched 473 strikes  mostly with drones  that killed between what it said were 2 372 and 2 581 terrorist “combatants”."   https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/01/obama-drones-strikes-civilian-deaths,0

245, Anyways  I don't know Pretty much it's it's about this cop  and there's this whore house and they want to get it shut down and the cop is sleeping with the owner of the whore house and you know  she wants him to be on her side and he  it it's an it's a weird movie and yeah it has funny moments and stuff but it just it just doesn't keep me involved throughout the movie because I I just know that I it's just weird and I'll probably won't watch this again and I can't recommend someone watch this because it's just  maybe for the someone that's older than me that has seen it in the past or watched shows like that in the past,0
246,He also regulated how much food and wine they could consume.,0

249,He took charge  in a sense  of the conversation right from the beginning  end quote. He presented the following signed note:,0
250,So Twitter is the new format for US Government policy decisions? Is Trump not tired of the court systems over-ruling his proclamations?,0
251,Reasonable ... your joking right. What you call reasonable usually means a tax reduction for the wealthy and a cut in services for the poor and middle class. Just look whats happening with the US budget if you need any further clarification on the matter.  In Alberta it will mean that industry goes back to monitoring itself (Fox meet Henhouse)  funding cut for monitoring clean air and water  a tax and royalty cut for oil and gas and increased taxes on the rest - oh sorry I mean fee hikes .... we wouldn't want to call those taxes would we. Thanks but I don't need that "Reasonable' any more  it usually costs me money.,0
252,He isn't a full time resident as best I can tell...does that mean he would just be visiting? (he lives in Boston  perhaps near Ignatieff  they should have coffee  and ask him how that works out...),0

261,The Browns thinks they are above the law. And unfortunately the Hoonah mayor and the village police are on the DC payroll. During the fight on the dock between the Brown hobbits and a few locals  Ami Brown started waving a pistol around. At the time she and most of her family were still under felony indictment and therefore not permitted to have a gun. I emailed the DA and asked him to investigate and he refused. He lamely said that he would mention it to the mayor and the village police. Um  ok. Idiot.,1
262,A cash for access event.  A donation to Pierre Elliott Trudeau Foundation.  He must be getting advise from the Clintons and Premier Wynne.  This is corruption at every possible level.  Justin has just become the new Duffy.,0
263,That was really great  Johnny.  I haven't laughed so hard and for so long since Trudeau said the budget would balance itself  the economy would grow outward from the heart and the only PMs in the 20th century who were any good were all from Quebec.  Both Scheer and Singh are intellectually in a different and higher league than The Clown Prince.  The PM is so outclassed and embarrassed by Scheer in parliament that he is now absent almost all of the time which not only demonstrates his lack of  leadership capability but also his contempt  inherited from his father  for parliament and opposition generally.  At least he won't also have to face Singh anytime soon in parliament inasmuch as the NDP leader will take his time and be careful in choosing a constituency in which to run.,0
264,Wake up dipshit the drugs go right back onto the streets in the hands of informants and police.  Cops are not our friends  theyre the real criminals.  You people really are ignorant.,1
265,Who gives a crap what this senile hateful poor loser has to say   he is a disgrace to this country and disrespectful to the the office of the President of the United states. He can't get over that Trump is President and he lost.,1
266,the only U.S. president to have bragged on video about grabbing women by their genitals ? Oh the only one who bragged - without actually doing so !  Because we know that Clinton and Kennedy both regularly had their hands in the honey jar .,1
267,The conditions faced by many aboriginal Canadians  and particularly those living on reserves  is unconscionable. But we've never been able to come up with a solution that doesn't involve massive spending increases and even then any assurance that money will actually fix the problems. Personally  I think the federal government doesn't adequately prioritize or target its spending and could address some of the problems faced by aboriginals were it to change course. But the economics of providing services to far-flung reserves are daunting and at some point taxpayers are likely to balk at the price of maintaining the system mainly for the sake of doing so. Ironically  the rationale for the flawed residential school system was integration  but that concept has been so discredited that no other response based on integration is even contemplated.,0
268,He's a sorry combination of Harper and Trump.  A shady little punk.,0
269,Any system where a "caregiver" is paid $8K/month while absent and irresponsible ... might that set up some red flags  somewhere ???!!!   A second matter - I am not familiar with the foster care system - but it is my understanding that foster parents do not retain their children for more than a year - some silly rule somewhere. Anybody clarify this ? If that is so it is another idiotic piece of bureaucracy .....  Anyway - this case is an embarrasment to our so called caring Canadian culture.,1
270,I bought a brick there  25 years ago. I paid for two lines of text and asked that it be inscribed with  "Impeach Hickel."    They wrote back and said that I couldn't have that. I said they were right  the message should have been "Recall Hickel."   "No " they said; they were "political."  So I got them to inscribe the brick with "In Memorium  E.V. Debs."  Second line:  "Hayduke Lives!"  Those got past the censors. I hope they keep the bricks.,0
271,The party is led by Samresh Singh.,0
272,Good on Pillar.  He's no stud  but he can play.  Had to listen to the stats geeks rabbit on for years 'bout how Pillar can't play.  Yeah  but he can  K-All never getting that a run saved equals a run scored  his fixation on how batters fare after facing a knuckleball pitcher more pressing and more worthy of his time and attention and in his never-ending battle for truth  justice and the American way--as he so wonderfully misunderstands it.  Pillar will always get ragged on by the baseball illiterati  while Jose Bautista gets a lifetime pass for his poor play this season on the field and at the plate.  Though  to be fair  Bautista has raised his season BA this month from .203 to now .207  perhaps enough for his sycophants to call for his re-signing  who knows....,0
273,"If the law supposes that " said Mr. Bumble  squeezing his hat emphatically in both hands  "the law is a ass - a idiot". As HZ says  this is a very complex issue. Not only has it to do with suitably available land in the urban setting but has a lot to do with the unavailability of private land and title deeds in the rural setting. It is a problem of how we are structured as a society. We are broken in so many ways and it is always someone else's fault.  It comes from the colonial days and grew in the Apartheid space which now thrives in the BBBEE and AA arena. If we keep insisting we are apart and in need of different rules for a different skin colour we will continue to feed this complex monster.,1

276,Funny  when I read about someone who was arrested "dozens and dozens" of times  I think of a problematic individual who has no respect for the public.  I also knew Carrie Miller; I knew her as an aggressive drunk  who insisted on displaying the fruits of her condition in public.  Miller was hardly the only homeless alcoholic in our town  but most others have the basic sense to find some secluded spot to drink  away from the public and police.  Miller did not do so  and THAT is the reason she was frequently arrested.  It was a sad state of affairs  but to suggest that Miller's own decision-making played no part in it  or that she had no alternatives  is flat-out untrue  I'm not sure how Mr. Leiman thinks we "failed" Miller  beyond the fact that we forbid public drinking and drunkenness.  Would he rather we live in an environment where people can legally get raging drunk on every streetcorner  while the rest us remain shut up in our homes to avoid being accosted?,0

294,Well  in Nome  Alaska a single can of soda is $1.69.  A gallon of milk is $5.79.  So that's about ten cans of soda in a gallon  so $16.90 for a gallon of soda.  But to be fair  the "cheaper  healthier alternative" to soda isn't milk. Its water.  And that's pretty much free and comes out of the tap.  Soda purchased by SNAP recipients  is done for the same reason that anyone else buys it  it triggers the pleasure sensor (dopamine) in your brain.  Something that water doesn't do.  They're not buying it because its a cheaper alternative.    Soda  sugar  snacks; they're pleasurable and addictive.  And we're paying people to decrease their health and supporting an entire industry at the same time.  We have every right to decide as a country what we want our government benefits to be spent on.   Hence this is a government/societal problem and not an individual consumer problem.,0

Older is innocent and openhearted.  I suspect the younger is plotting to take over the world like that evil mouse character ('the Brain').  She deleted all the programs on her dad's 'smart' phone at a month shy of age two  while still in diapers  and downloaded 'angry birds' and other things she wanted instead.  And she made up her own weird names for everyone in her immediate family.  Oldest loves 'lollies' (Australian word for 'candy').  As I was preparing for a visit there  I promised her over the phone that I'd bring her a bag of lollies as big as her head.  And before I could 'shush' her she excitedly turned to her dad and said  "Baba's gonna bring me a bag of lollies as BIG as my HEAD!"  And of course I could hear my son in the background telling her to hand him to phone so he could talk to Baba...ouch.,0

307,Aloha    Actually  the ali'i did give land to the people long-prior to the overthrow.  What could be considered the privatization of land occured in 1848  where it further opened up in 1850.  The overthrow happened roughly 43 years later.    I believe the primary source of income for the Hawaiian Kingdom government (HK) was agriculture (primarily sugar).    I think the problem  of course  was multi-faceted.  The rush for privatization of land came as a result of European nations (like Britain and France) claiming other already settled Pacific islands (like Aotearoa and Tahiti) and turning their sights to Hawai'i.  The HK divided it's lands  in part  so the totality of lands was dispersed to the people.  However  without a fully functional economy (in those early days)  it was hard for Hawaiians to hold onto those lands.    I very much agree that ceded lands should be made available to Native Hawaiians and I appreciate you saying so.  Thank you for your comment.,0

If I recall the circumstance correctly  you were chastised for uncivil remarks or excessive down voting- I don't remember which.  When you came on a while ago to make your grand farewell  you were so gracious to posters who said " I am going to write to them on your behalf." Don't you think that encouraged people? And you have encouraged posters to write to CC on issues such as blocking.  Let's stop this now. It is disruptive to the actual conversation. It only seems to encourage the one who was corrected  the one I did complain about  the one I told I would complain - for I do nothing behind-the-back - to join in the attack..

317,This is not rocket science.  Poloz is talking down the economy for two important reasons.  First  he is unsure of the affects of a renegotiated NAFTA and all the potential nonsense the Trump administration might demand.  Better to hold until more is known.  Second  the Canadian dollar has hovered at about 75 cents for the whole period of economic improvement.  Poloz clearly believes that a higher Canadian dollar is a risk to growth.  Therefore he talks down the wellness of the economy to keep the Canadian dollar from rising in a second order manner and to avoid any discussion of higher rates in Canada in a first order way.  The only mystery is why the Globe and some bank economists are in any way confused by the strategy.,0

347,Nope. Except for wiliki’s statement that there were originally (up until the end of 2006) two routes  both wiliki and papio5 are incorrect. What happened was polls concluded the majority of Salt Lake residents OPPOSED the route going through their community. So it was absurd that Romy was pushing the route — AGAINST the wishes of his constituents.  The investigation into Cachola’s misconduct failed to produce the most relevant information: whose interests did the Aliamanu  Salt Lake and Foster Village Neighborhood Board REALLY represent — and why were they asking Romy to push Salt Lake?  Anyhow  the council appeased Romy by changing the route temporarily to Salt Lake (a complete shibai for the SOLE purpose of securing his vote. They needed it to preserve the slim 5-4 majority that favored proceeding on the rail transit plan the city has been executing — ever since). Cachola had fallen out of favor well before the misconduct scandal — so the airport route was never in question.,0
348,The United States receives 80% of Mexico's exports.    If they are truly a friend  why did they allow tens of thousands pass through their country to cross the US border illegally?  These are not only people from countries in Central/South America  but from Africa and the Middle East?  Mexico cannot survive without cooperation from the US  whether it's the importation of 80% of their exports or the billions of dollars transferred to their country immigrants in this country or direct aid from the US government.  They need to do a better job securing their borders and ours. If we stop buying their oil they are in a world of hurt.  It won't be long until we need not buy their oil.

370,E24..... Don't get distracted by the "automatic" weapon issue.  Semi-automatic weapons (requiring a trigger-pull for each firing) are more than adequate (in combination with high capacity magazines...up to 100 rounds) to kill dozens or innocent persons.  The gun industry/NRA will be presenting "talking points" to convince us that this massacre had "nothing" to do with guns.....the guy would have used some other weapon if they weren't available...besides the Second Amendment is there to "protect" us all.  Pleas for controls on the lethality of weapons have been ignored.

(Honolulu Charter  Sec. 3-401)" Perhaps the only possibility is a media campaign and independent survey of a representative sample of the citizens of C&C Honolulu asking questions like  e.g.: "Do you think a 15% tax should be applied to property purchases by non-resident investors?",0

405,We disagree on the need for and the effects of the Kinder Morgan pipeline expansion  but on her assessment of Trudeau the author is bang on.  Bullseye!  The man is a fakir  a charlatan  a hoaxer  a tin-man  a purveyor of platitudes  a prevaricating promise breaker.  Not only not ready  but not capable of ever being ready.  Trudeau is a dim bulb convinced he's shining brightly as he gropes his way through the darkness of his limited understanding.    Pathetic.  Jr!  No one believes you anymore!  Are you listening?

408,While I am sure the Greens and NDP will try to do everything to make it last the full four years a big issue is which party does the speaker come from.  If a BC Liberal it has a much better chance of lasting four years than if an NDP speaker as in the former it is 42-44 while the latter is 43-43 and best on Denison's rules speaker votes affirmative on confidence issues  first and second reading  but negative on third reading so no guarantee they will get much through.  Also one MLA resigns  dies  kicked out of caucus  is absent  loss of by-election  or chooses to sit as an independent and they lose their majority.  It's possible they make it through the full four years  but they will need not just skill but luck too as don't expect the BC Liberals to pair them on any confidence votes if one cannot make it.,0

415,All good questions  Thomas. I attended one of the informational (sales) meetings for this project and came away with mixed reaction. While it makes sense to make sure the workforce is able to live where they work & we apparently do need more 'affordable' housing  I believe some of the job numbers offered seemed to contain several assumptions. Some questions asked at the meeting (by would-be neighbors) particularly regarding the water issue  were met with arrogance. If I understood correctly  the proposed site isn't in the UGA yet  but is outside the JPA. Can't tell from maps. As far as the '41 recommendations' of the Housing Task Force that Jason mentions  I believe many are absolutely necessary & doable  but am wary of recommended increased property taxes for the county to buy MORE property for subsidized housing. Let's not confuse facilitating growth of for-profit AFFORDABLE housing (used to be call real estate) market with creating non-profit  taxpayer subsidized housing. Two issues,0
416,Same ridiculous response.  GOP couldn't fix it.  No spin there.  All this time  all these complaints - all for nothing.  FAIL!!,1

422,"but he did so by running a 50 billion dollar deficit one year."  Which is the textbook way of handling major recessions - You run deficits during the recessionary period.  To put it in the context of your very valid question.  You are the PM (Any Party you want) and the economy is shrinking at the fastest rate on record  so tax revenues are collapsing and EI payments booming. Your budget projections now show a substantial deficit - 3% of GDP.  Raising taxes to close the deficit would make the recession even worse  so which programs are you going to eviscerate to return to balance? EI  so all those people losing jobs can't get it? Health Transfers?   Except slashing those programs will also worsen the recession  .....,0

431,It takes a big man to admit he was wrong  Mr. Neal. Which is why the govmint bureaucrats will never admit (as one park employee did to me off-the-record) that fish ladders could have been built for far  far less  and dredging of the lakes could have moved silt downstream while maintaining flood control and drought protection of those wonderful reservoirs. Once government gets it in its head to do something no amount of reason and facts will dissuade it  e.g. the Fluoride Four controlling P.A.'s city council in opposition to the clear will of the majority of the population.  It really is unfair to limit the cost of dam removal to $325 million however. As you note  repair of flood damage to roads and residences and loss of freshwater storage will mean this "gift" from radical "free-the-river" advocates will keep on costing us in perpetuity now.,0
432,No  he was acting on what he had been allowed to get away with in the past. Wrongly. Implied consent requires medical practicality- such as you are in an accident and they do CPR without knowing if you have a DNR. This was illegal search and seizure  it had nothing to do with his immediate peril. The force is using that to have an excuse for their practices. And I am certain there was never a policy that said that you could rough up someone who was protecting the legal rights of a comotose citizen. The nurse did nothing that justified him touching her in any way  especially in anger. She said no to his illegal demand  period.,0

437,Ah how things maybe come full circle. Trump preached the birther canard about Obama for years and then there were the constant stories out of the alt right about Obama being gay  Michelle was really a man  Hillary was a lesbian Bill Clinton a pedophile and rapist and then there was Sex Island where Bill and Hill could go and and pleasure themselves with underage girls. And remember Pizza-gate as well. To Obama's and the Clinton's credit they never took the bait on this crap. So now here we have stories about Trump. Well turn about is maybe fair play? Although yes it is still unseemly. And best part is that Trump can't just ignore it like the Obama's and the Clinton's did. He goes nuts.,1
438,20 million "motor voter" votes were cast and counted.  They ALL went Demo-liberal.  I'm being VERY generous in proposing only 5 of 20 million cast  were illegals.  Of course they voted  they're not idiots.  Stick your head back in the sand  I'm sure it's comforting.,1

I told the Gov. that I would talk to Sen. Lisa M. to get training dollars from the Federal government. I met Sen. Lisa M. at the entrance to the State fair & I filled her ear with the Idea of getting training dollars to use teaching homeless to get in a survival suit & first aid training. then sent them to work on the many  Trawlers or help with the clean up of Alaska's coast. also doors would open to the fishery business. the Municipality of Anchorage should be informed since it's their Street's that would be impacted and with winter coming soon   last winter a few churches had to open their doors to house the homeless. lets take action to help these people who have no where else to turn & give them a chance to get off the streets.  going through a detox program can be a requirement to open long term goals.,0

444,So the Trump supporters are not alarmed that: 1) Trump is not going to completely dissociate himself from his business  and he and his minions are talking up that 'there is no such thing as conflict of interest'  and how his children are becoming the 'princelings' who have their hands into the White House while running the family business like the Third World kleptocracy 2) he dismissed the conclusion of the intelligence agencies (CIA and FBI) that Russia hackers aimed to help him get elected.  Instead of alarming as any patriotic Americans would  he trashed it like any self serving narcissist would behave.  He still uses tweet liberally including attacking a union boss who corrected him the real no. of jobs saved in Carriers  despite his position .  These people still thinks there is nothing wrong with it?  Useful idiots are in abundance!,1

Trump will almost certainly resign or be impeached because of this - but not because he colluded but because he obstructed justice,0

461,What a jerk!,1
462,Nope  that proven too.  The only debate is by how much  literally by the .01 of a degree.  But it's been proven.  The human causation is a red herring made up and propagated by tabloids like the Rebel.  It's convenient for people to think this way  so they are not implicated and they feel less responsible.,0
463,Canada should do the same.  Of course it won't because in typical hypocritical Canadian fashion;  Canadians love it when foreign criminals launder their loot through the Canadian financial system.

I think it is a small group of people focusing on hate. And part of this is the people who are always looking for it in everything anyone does. Try this. Instead of looking everywhere for hate  look around and see how much love and kindness that the people in our communities show to each other. You will soon start to see this instead.,0

Add in the known damage to developing brains and it is clear that we are well beyond the time to start taking this seriously. Then again  maybe the people in charge have spent so much time exposed to these intelligence-lowering particulates that they can't understand the issue.

517,A good rail system is an investment in the future for our children and grandchildren. It will pay off in the long run. Yes there is much to invest in. We should also invest in kids in poverty who never receive adequate early education. They do very poorly in school and in life if they miss the important developmental tasks in their early years. For them it's a basic need. And for us it's an investment in their futures that they cannot afford. Studies show that even at ages 27 and 40 they lose out and are on the bottom of the heap.  "...significantly higher earnings  rates of home ownership  and levels of schooling  as well as significantly fewer arrests and social service interventions  than a control group of non-preschool participants. Cost-benefit analysis revealed that  over the lifetimes of the participants  the preschool program returned to the public an estimated $7.16 for every dollar spent.",0

528,Glenn  I agree with what you're saying.  Alaska is way bigger and has way more fisheries so their gross economic benefit is bigger.  In Hawaii we are one relatively small longline fishery.  That being said  when you consider the supporting industries like restaurants  sport fishing  cultural exports like poke  this fishery is tremendously important.  I wish the supporter of the monument would recognize that.  They seem to be blinded by their privilege of being able to make a living from PEW grants and environmental NGOs.  They don't care about having fish because they can afford whole foods beef that comes from cows guaranteed to have been given a toy to play with before slaughter.,0

532,Psychiatric eval's have been done for years.  Personally  along with intensive background checks  done by a field officer  I was subjected to them when I worked for the 2 departments I did-1 in the mid 70's and a 2nd in the early 80's  even though I was currently working  and in good standing  in another department.  Polygraph's  too  although they have given way to voice stress analyzers (VSA's).,0
533,The  niece of MLK! Now that carries weight. Would that be the same  niece who tried to claim that Rosa Parks  who was on the Board of Planned Parenthood  was actually an anti-abortion hero?

534,Oh my...this has to be a new low for complaining. Mr. Hawke may find he has been suckered in. I wouldn't be surprised if most of Trump's promises are not enacted to the degree promised. He is a clever one. Everyone knows politiians lie or do not do as promised when elected. Trump  like all of us except maybe Mr. Haske  knows that's how politicians operate. This last round Trump took full advantage of that laying out a list that excited some and frightened others. The fright crowd is interesting as it is like "phantom pain"...or in this case "empathetic fear" for those here illegally. The Wall  the Family Deportations are 2 examples I don't think will be implemented as described.  Like the Democrats who switched after 50 years and voted Republican..."it's the economy stupid" that sunk the SS Clinton and it was the Wall that brought out the law and order voters. It was the perfect storm for Trump..jobs and law and order.,1

536,It was always fairly obvious that MH370 was headed for Ressano Garcia and went/was brought down in that area. So one does need to ask why Australia (and presumably  its other 5-eyes allies) undertook such an expensive distraction by searching in the wrong place .

When my parents moved to Canada decades ago  rates were around that and they thought it at that time it was outrageous because rates where the lived previously were lower.   In any event  they had no interest in mortgages or loans.  They saved cash to buy their first car and house.,0
552,I worked with Don many years.  He was an avionics wizard...well  electronics wiz in general.  He designed an emergency light system which was certified by the FAA and installed on numerous aircraft.  He could engage in knowledgeable discussion on a varied range of topics.  Listening to him on APRN you might mistake his voice for The Great Steve Heimel.    Having lost touch with Don over the years  I often wondered what he was up to....and this is the heartbreaking news I first saw  having just returned from 20 days chasing moose (yes  there'll be meat in the freezer this year).    Perhaps this is a good time to rekindle an old friendship.  Don is just the type of interesting fellow who make Alaska unique.,0
553,That's the mantra in businesses  these days alright but it isn't viable in the long run. The last company I worked for as laid off so many people that it no longer truly has the ability to do the development work that it needs to grow the business in a healthy way. They also laid off support and test staff. It's awfully hard to convince existing customers to upgrade when they can't get support for the gear that you sold them already! This same concept drives offshoring jobs and hence the true value of a business in its host community.,0
554,Toronto taxpayers should learn the names of all the idiot Trustees who voted for this ridiculous and ignorant  illiterate motion and make sure that none of these jerks ever gets elected again. They are not just ignorant they are dangerous and continue to put our public system of education in peril. Why? Because it's this kind of nazi-like political correctness that is driving common sense parents to send their children to private schools thereby eventually lowing enrollments in the public system and bringing on the expected consequences. Many of our Indigenous Peoples with an IQ higher than room temperature will feel insulted by this patronizing policy of the TDSB and echo the ideas in this editorial.,1
555,Paul Wong  do you work for Pebble? Pebble is Alaska's problem not China's and if China has a pollution problem then they also have a population problem and the loss of 750 000 people is a start.

Pebble is wrong now and at some future time when the fish are all caught out by Oregonians and Alaska can profit from the mines then maybe and only maybe.,0

Any reasonably intelligent person with a strong back can be a cop or a fire fighter as this is a training on the job type of occupation.

607,MSW says  “We all remember the riots in Ferguson  Mo.  after the killing of Michael Brown. Some on the left saw the event as evidence of ongoing  structural racism. Some on the right saw it as the justifiable action of a police officer in a fraught situation. “  If we are still going to talk about this  let’s at least give the facts a chance.  The following is from wikipedia:   “ On March 4  2015  the U.S. Department of Justice reported the conclusion of its own investigation and cleared Wilson of civil rights violations in the shooting. It found that forensic evidence supported the officer's account  that witnesses who corroborated the officer's account were credible  and that witnesses who had incriminated him were not credible  with some admitting that they had not directly seen the events.[13][15] The U.S. Department of Justice concluded that Wilson shot Brown in self-defense.[16][17]  “,0
608,Ok  I’m a little confused here? Sanctuary from what? From my meager reading of history Sanctuary was always in a church when someone unjustly accused fled ruthless  jackbooted police or solders. I don’t recall seeing many of that type skulking around Langley? So from reading the Record article is sanctuary from the law for criminals falsely accused or perhaps the rightfully accused? So unless we are  talking a bout drunk drivers who killed someone or arsonists I guess we are talking about just plain old illegal aliens here illegally  breaking the law of the land? So this begs the question of what laws do we want to ignore? Isn’t illegal just illegal period? Who gets to pick and chose what law to ignore? Who gets to put its stamp of approval on breaking one law over another  the Langley Ethics Committee? Somehow this sounds like anarchy. Perhaps they should make their house a sanctuary  house them  feed them  pay for their medical? Not going to happen is it.,0
609,Every major media outlet has Editorial Guidelines posted on their websites. For example the BCC states that in the immediate aftermath of an event involving death  suffering or distress  the use of more graphic material is normally justified to provide a reasonable account of the full horror  although an evocative script is equally important in conveying the reality of tragedy and providing context for the material.  However  as the story unfolds it may become more difficult to justify the continued use of such graphic material.  Then when it comes to considering the story in a contemporary historical context or  for example  marking its anniversary  it may become editorially justified to use the material again.,0

Trump also doesn't expect the avalanche of lawsuits that are heading his way from almost every single private landowner from whom Trump will need to seize property to build his ridiculous wall.  That property is all privately owned  and volunteer lawyers are stepping up to help every land owner fight Trump tooth and nail over the seizure of their land.  The appeals will never end.  Did any of you wonder why none of the border state congressional delegations support Trump's plan?  Because Trump will need to seize their constituents' land to do it.  Good luck with that.  Trump is a psychotic.  The sooner he is impeached or resigns the better.  Pence is no bargain  but at least he isn't insane.  The first 100 days days have been a complete failure.

636,I believe that nobody has the right to turn people away just because of their ethnic background race etc... And if trump is going to turn people away and immigrants he should start with that Russian whore of a wife because she's an immigrant and her children as well since their mother is an immigrant. If I ever had to compare Trump to anyone it would be Adolf Hitler himself because they both were about world domination and power. Trump also is going to be responsible for many people's death due to the ones that need to seek asylum for life or death situations and he knows  it and he knows he's sending people back which is just a death sentence itself so congratulations to all you assholes that voted for him because you are no better then him as far as I'm concerned Trump is a closet skinhead that is teaching youth to hate and to send us all back to the era where if your not white then your a nobody.

639,"Leisure" in the sense that the "liberal arts" all require leisure: the intellectual and aesthetic pursuits of free people  who are free of the need to work for their daily bread as a field hand or a banausic craftsman is not. Of course  now that university pursuits are professionalized  and teaching and research have been organized as professions more or less imprisoned in the wage-labor contractual system of now-globalized capitalism  to that extent are the liberal arts corrupted  and no longer themselves.  It's an important subject in Dante studies  where exactly he got his learning  in philosophy  theology  history  and not least  Ptolemaic cosmology.

That's the essence of being a liberal  the self-sanctimony (like many religious folks) that there are good people and there are bad people and the self-pride that comes from knowing the person in the mirror is one of the former.  It's a child's view of life  particularly attractive to millennials who have been raised on this stuff.  And that's what Trudeau gets.  Conservatives and conservatives have a more mature view of human nature  that we are each capable of doing good or doing evil  and so have a more guarded view of human possibilities - that society is more nuanced than just sunny days  parades and ever-harmonious "diversity".  And that's why today's Canadians will continue to reject Conservatives.,0

Earth to Wente: you're supposed to be talking politics here  not who you are attracted to. She thinks he doesn't hate blacks or Mexicans. She ignores that his promised actions will actually hurt millions of Mexicans. I guess Wente has it figured out that actions don't count  but only intentions.

Global surface warming is continuing at 0.18 °C/decade (past 30 year trend). 2014  2015 and 2016 were successively the warmest years in the 1850-date instrumental record. 2017 will likely be the second or third warmest year on record.  The Antarctic Peninsula and West Antarctica are losing land ice faster than East Antarctica is gaining mass via increased snowfall. Even there  ice loss from several major glaciers in East Antarctica is beginning to accelerate  and giant ice shelves are breaking up. Seasonal Antarctic sea ice hit record lows in 2016-17.  Maybe you should look at the science itself instead of relying on denier websites and blogs.,0
651,Looking at the past 25 years  owning a home has been a path to quick riches. Interest rates fell from double digit to less than 2.5% for a five year fixed mortgage; historic low. House prices have gone through the roof. Home owners  particularly in the large urban centres  have seen their net worth balloon. From a starting point of today  I am not sure that interest rates are going lower; rather it is likely they have bottomed and are now headed higher. House prices also look crazy high. I am not sure that the next 25 years are going to be as beneficial to ones net worth as the last 25 years. Starting from today renting may well be the better decision (over buying) looking at it strictly from a financial perspective.,0
652,I am alarmed.  I didn't vote for him  but I don't have blinders on either.  He is a liar and he is in trouble.  Defend this fool all you want   he's already thrown his vp and media team under the bus.  And I admit  although he's been a horrible president  I bet he's a wonderful role model for Barron,1
653,Spicer gets beat up because he's tries to stand up for his stupid boss. Only a hard up fool would try and make excuses for a pathological liar.

659,No jest.  I look at every moment with my children as irreplaceable and so virtues are never far from my mind.   Weapons training and cleaning can provide enormous virtue.  We occasionally have "tire changing Saturday"....where our children learn to change tires safely and confidently.  One of my early dates with my now wife was spent having her learn how to change a tire...and we did it in the rain.  She loved it.   It was great fun.  She still tals about it.   There are too many lazy corpulent adults who simply dial up AAA when they have a flat tire.  It's a sad softening of America.     Weapons cleaning/use..no big deal...just another event to get the most out of with one's children.,0

669,"As a legislator  she would have no undue influence on a sitting judge..."  That might be true  Charles  if she wasn't the chairwoman of the committee that controls the court's budget.  A sitting judge understands the implications of his budget being gutted.    There's also some questions about her proposed amendment to the crime bill that might have benefitted the 18 year old son of a constituent who was charged with molesting a 12 year old.  That's not a simple letter to the court  it's something far worse.     Compassion is fine.  Abusing one's political power is called 'corruption'.,0

676,Right Tim   The state of Alaska's financial woes should be blamed squarely on people needing rescue. It certainly has nothing to do with decades of regressive fiscal policies like pretending high oil revenues were eternal  relying on federal subsidies instead of a state income tax  and general squandering of money on personal pet projects. But hey  at least you get to collect your PFD each year! Where did all the revenue go from the years of $120/barrel oil? Must have been wasted on rescues?  Oh by the way  the rescue was ultimately performed by the NPS  not the Air National Guard  and in any case  the cost of such rescues  whether they are performed by the NPS or the Guard  comes out of the national SAR account  which covers rescue costs for everyone from mountain climbers to snowmachiners to fisherman to lost children on trails. State of Alaska doesn't foot the bill in this case. On the big scale  this rescue might have cost you about 4 cents  so your rage is certainly justified.,0

681,I was not stating factually that Your Js had ruined Sanchez  never said anything like that.  What I did was question how they used  and overused  him.   The changing strategy  which would indicate most likely that whatever strategy they were following with him  it changed quite a few times due solely to circumstance(s).  That was a fair thing to say.  I noted his #s were terrible in the spring  but also not to read much into that.  Look at Lirianos's spring #s compared to his god-awful 1st start.    If they've done damage to his arm  it won't come out till much later  months from now.  But we will see.  Just b/c Your Js mucked around with him last season  doesn't necessarily mean he's going to suffer any consequences  my point was at the time  why take that chance.,0
682,Justin has no idea what the trade imbalance between Canada and Mexico is  or how many cars we import or export   to/ from either  the US or Mexico. He has no grasp of economics   and  stuff like  national interests as they pertain to trade  negotiations.  He will however go on a national town hall tour to meet Liberals all across Canada. For that he will get a hair cut and a  new suit,0
683,The problem is that it only works less than 50 per cent of the time under ideal conditions - not battlefield conditions - in those circumstances the failure rate will be significantly higher. Do you really want that protecting your children from a nuke  something that works less than half the time? Negotiations are still way less expensive than this colossal waste of money. I'd say that is the only thing here that is not optional.,0

696,This is the ultimate results when people are allowed to violate law. There are people today doing exactly what her mother did years ago. To this day there are illegal aliens bringing they children who are also in the country illegally into the country with the sole purpose of stay here illegally.

699,I am most disappointed that when either Trudeau or Morneau speak they only give part of the story. Partial  or half truths do not help this debate. Let us understand that any retained earnings in a corporation must appear on a personal T1 tax return if that money is to be used personally. Small business corporate retained earnings are taxes partially deferred not avoided. Eventually that money comes out and taxes are paid at a personal marginal rate. Tell the whole story.,0
700,You are showing your true colors there  Jack.  It's just snow.,0
701,Fascism today does not need jack booted brown shirts to impose its will. All it needs  it seems  is control of social media. The Russian Candidate's many minions are willing to do his bidding  shouting down the opposition while promoting his message.  We are living in an age when science no longer solves our social problems. Many are reverting to faith or demagogues because nothing else seems to work. Humans have always been susceptible to these forces. We are reverting to them for lack of better options.  When Hitler and Mussolini came to power there were social crises in their respective nations that ordinary people could do nothing about. Elected governments were ineffectual. Still  people were more self reliant and radio/movie theatres were the extent of social media. They were less susceptible to the message and therefor resisted. Today we are sheep.  It is time we reassessed what fascism means around the world because the US is not unique.,0
702,How can they teach kids better.....by replacing classroom-teacher-led instruction (in most core curriculum subjects) with wholly computerized instruction - that tracks every kid and allows no kid (repeat none) to fall woefully behind his/her classmates. Such instruction could be made to be as interesting and successful as video games.  It is possible and therefore  in tight times  inevitable. The teacher unions have priced themselves out of a future.,0

708,The War in Vietnam was a mistake. Most Americans had figured that out before 1970. Quit trying to reframe it as some noble cause.  The Pentagon Papers told the real story  but most Americans had realised that they were being lied to by 1970. I jhave great faith in the ability of most folks to eventually realise what is really in their own best interest. That is why Trump has no future.  Claiming otherwise is the same as southern USA racists going on and on about their racist ancestors fighting to keep slavery going and the need to keep flying the Confederate Flag.  Daniel Ellsberg was the subject of the most intense manhunt in USA history  but all he had to do to avoid arrest was approach a young person on the street and tell them that he needed a place to stay for the night  was doing something against the war  and that helping him might be dangerous for them.  Nobody turned Ellsberg down and nobody turned him him.  Trump hasn't even begun to understand the meaning of resistance yet.,0

He's been doubling down on ideas that have failed repeatedly over the years  yet he still thinks that with a little more effort they will be successful. He's a political relic that needs to retire and is a perfect example of why we need term limits in government.,0

723,OK  WW  thanks for this.    I would say "better"  i.e.  more mainstream sources - still  hard to know how serious to take such news articles.  You mention the WHO in your original post  but I see no ties to the U.N. described in any of the links.  The DARA group looks like an ad hoc organization convened to drum up donations - I note on their website  they claim an "estimated" 400 000 deaths per year due to the impacts of climate change.  In the small print  they admit that most of these deaths are due to malnutrition and communicable disease in 3rd World tropical countries which have *always* had terrible problems with bad governance  poverty  ethnic violence  and agricultural self-sufficiency.  Just that now they get to blame these endemic issues on climate and accuse the 1st World nations of complicity. Huh.  DARA  by the way  apparently = Bangladesh  Barbados  Bhutan  Kiribati  Ghana  Kenya  Nepal  Rwanda  Tanzania  Vietnam and  the Maldives.,0

726,It's time for the opponents to this rail design to cease and desist from torpedoing the project. As an advocate of at-grade rail on the pre-existing OR&L right-of-way   closing side streets and grade-separating major thoroughfares  I am disappointed that we were muzzled during the advanced planning stages. However  the only reasonable issue at hand is who will be paying for the completion of the project to Ala Moana Center and eventually to UH Manoa. We have an oligarchy here in Hawaii Nei  just like we have in DC. Both major parties are in the control of corporate interests at the detriment of working families and retirees.

763,I guess I'll have to start putting the source in again  especially for poor Motley. The 30% loss of cyclists in Eugene since 2009 comes from the US Census American Community Survey. It tracks mode of commuting  a reasonable stand-in for overall cycling. In 2009  10.8% of all workers living in Eugene used their bikes to commute. In 2015  the latest year of data  that had fallen to 7.6%.  It's a little difficult to get to the data if you haven't played with it before  so here's some help. Go to American Fact finder  scroll down to American Community Survey  click on "get data". In the new page  click on geographies  select "place"  choose your state  select the city you're interested in and then close the geography window. In the data choices  click on "commuting characteristics by sex" (one year data  not 5-year smoothed) and you will see the various modes broken down by numbers  percentages and genders. To see other years  select one from the list on the left.,0

767,All parish school employees serve at the pleasure of the pastor and secondary school employees are accountable through the principal to the bishop who has the last word. That needs to be something everyone who serves in those environments needs to take to heart if they have qualms about those to whom they report. Given the need for teachers and administrators anyone not comfortable with a priest micromanaging a parish school should give notice. When the diocese finds they can not find or retain quality staff they will do some introspection and correct what isn't working  unless they are self-righteous idiots.,1

She still writes letters to friends and family  and the recipients will often seem not just surprised  and delighted to receive one  but also at a bit of a  loss as to what they're supposed to do next.  You've hit on a big power in those letters: both that in physically writing  most of us have to go through some kind of process of organizing our thoughts  AND that all important choice to send or tear it up once done  as you noted.  I DO think (hope) that a day will come when we in society come to understand the power of what we put on the web  and I sincerely hope for a return to a slightly more well mannered society.  I don't think I'm alone.  But I also think that fear  dislike and pain are also powerful drivers  and so some have learned how to play off of those to get what they want. Community worship IS an intimate act.  So is personal reflection.,0

774,"A sanctuary city is one that has adopted a policy of protecting undocumented immigrants by not pursuing charges for violating immigration laws."  My question to all of you who are so outspoken in your opposal is....why do you see an undocumented person as someone who is 'illegal?'  My grandparents from Sweden and Ireland came over with no papers. How many of yours did the same??  Unless all your Peeps came over on the Mayflower?   I am so saddened by the responses here.  And I thought  after 30 years here  that the South End was different.  So darn sad by these comments.  Where are all of you Social Justice People?  (other than Ms Belinda Griswold)  Time to stand up to this type of rhetoric people!  These folks use the word 'illegal' and some people immediately assume 'criminal.'  These immigrants are called illegal because they manage to get here to safety any way they can that keeps them safe.

I wasn't happy about how the system used to work  but it's much different now . . . yet the same comments get posted as if nothing had changed.  Please excuse me for not being patient with you  but do you have any idea how many times those kind of comments keep getting posted here ("kangaroo court" yadda  yadda)?  Enough  already - it's been almost 10 years.  As someone with more 'tone' than I wrote: "Educate yourself instead of just making comments."

The nearly 90 year old man over-promised and under-delivered   The Biden White House is failing in a very public way to nail down a nearly $3 trillion domestic package that the forgetful “president” has framed as a historic investment in infrastructure and social spending  the moment is clouded by a sense among many democrats that the scaled back package falls far short of the lofty expectations set by the president himself.,1

801,Cliff  again thanks for your response.  Okay  but a 5- or 10-day weather model can be retuned every 5 or 10 days to closer match reality for the next time.  Not so with a model that's trying to see decades into the future  so they're basically untestable  which kind of calls into question the scientific basis of the whole endeavor since scientific theories are supposed to be falsifiable.  And wouldn't the proof of the theory behind the climate models be that the models make accurate predictions?  My impression is that they've all been running too hot  which would indicate less actual sensitivity to CO2 than modeled.  Patrick Frank wrote that paper in Skeptic a few years back about climate models where he seemed to show that the radiative effect due to the average annual cloud error in GCMs was about equal to the entire radiative effect of anthropogenic CO2 since the start of the Industrial Revolution  rendering model predictions worthless even a few years out.  Any thoughts on that?,0

815,You do know "The Shack" is fiction  right?    I read the book years ago.....written from a more new age or emerging church view   the book is good entertainment and does involve the reader emotionally.  But it can be threatening if taken as a theological treatise...there are rules and Absolute Truth  despite what Mr. Young writes. The message that in spite of evil  God loves us and is with us is well-appreciated and faith based.  Mr. Young's presentation of Trinity I recall was very good - three distinct persons yet ONE God.    I remember at the time dissecting the book in a Diocesan group discussion - one of the resources used was this: https://www.osv.com/OSVNewsweekly/Story/TabId/2672/ArtMID/13567/ArticleID/10399/What%E2%80%99s-in-The-Shack.aspx  I think the insistence on referring to God as "She" or anything else is rather silly and merely politically correct.  I have no problem thinking of God in terms of "Father" - I am secure enough in who I am to know that God loves me as I am.,0

817,Translater  We live in a democracy  and 37% is not a majority.  Furthermore  you're talking about 37% of households  not individuals  and different individuals in the same household can hold different opinions.

820,Trump has already taken care of the paperwork to start building the wall.  He has also placed a 20% tax on everything coming out of Mexico to the American consumer...yes  they will pay for this wall.  Keep up with the news  Trump is doing everything he promised the American people he'd do.  We're just not used to seeing government work quickly.

823,Trump pulled out of the Paris Agreement for good reason. Every single scientist in Climate Warming knows that there are 400 plus units of carbon flow that we know about that determine the atmospheric CO2 levels. They also know that everything done to date is based on a mere 8.3 units out of the 400 plus. Ignoring 98% of the issues is beyond sheer stupidity. Amazing that when CANNR says forest fires emitted 500 to 700 megatonnes of ghgs and in the same breath say " Canada's total ghg emissions are 722 megatonnes" none of the readers question how that can be. The answer to  their dirty little secret is in sentences 2 to 5 above.,1
824,Wow.  You are a total dumbaasss!,1
825,There are serious potential causes behind Trump's behaviour - here's just one.   Trump has taken Propecia (finasteride) - to help prevent male pattern baldness - for many years  according to a report released by his doctor. The side effects of this drug are legion  and serious. The term post-finasteride syndrome (PFS) has been coined and hundreds of lawsuits have been brought in regard to its sexual side effects  (shrinking penis  poor sexual function) and the drug's effects on cognition  mood and mental states have been documented in the scientific literature. Many users noted a "disconnection between the mental and physical aspects of sexual function " and changes in mental abilities  sleeping patterns  and/or depressive symptoms. Sound familiar?  Trump must be particularly insecure to take this drug. Not a good quality in a world leader with the means to kill billions at his fingertips.

826,Ax-ol Norty-wala  has no point here.  Cleaning a toilet was/is a primary school lesson - NEVER given by the ANC schools. SADTU has never suggested it. This has nothing to do with race. This is basic hygiene learnt at home...or school. [NOTE: this type of necessary education is NOT in any ANC-driven Primary School syllabus - ANC misled...again?].  Does Ax-ol ever clean his own toilet? Wee do in our house - wee each clean the toilet upon use. If the massive father-less community in the Cape Flats is suffering from "No Father Figure With Rules of the Home" [which really includes the principle of father being at home to help proper parenting] THAT is where Ax-Ol should be pointing a finger  and crying for help  and giving advice  and driving social awarenesses thereto  inter alia  as General Secretary of a Social Justice Coalition!

849,No foreign aide. It will be loans with expected repayment.  Tell me Israel will go along with this.  Tell States how they just come up with funds to cover Medicade; raise taxes.  This is similar to how the Alaska legislature has cut things in the past; end funding and let municipalities raise taxes to replace the funds.    This is not a budget it a talking point list for the Trumptards.  Trump promised to end the national debt. This budget reduces spending over a ten year period. It does nothing towards the reduction of the national debt as the annual interest grows more than the annual saving in this budget.,0
850,Wherever China and Russia were positioned  Trump has given them additional power.  How much?  LOTS.  Enough to give them the ability to coalesce with one another  and isolate the US on the issue of NK.  BOTH China and Russia are publicly  and directly opposing the US on NK.  The rest of the world is silent in the face of that opposition.  Trump opened the door WIDE to that.  The shift is remarkable  dangerous  and a HUGE step backwards.  And  you could see it coming.  Trump totally misread  bumbled and overplayed his hand with NK.  He's taught countries with potential for nuclear technology that they can develop it wtihout being concerned about US military intervention.  It's a breathtaking diminution of US power  regard and deterrent force.  The discussion is no longer about the prospect of disarming NK nuclearly.  It is about China and Russia telling the US it cannot use military action upon NK.    Trump has solidified NK as a presumptive nuclear power.  Maybe others' too.  Idiotic.,1

852,Globalization and the information  IT and securitization revolutions means that a few metropolitan centres have become international hubs for the wealthy and where innovation  the arts and/or commerce flourish.    Canada has the good fortune and the serious burden of having  in Greater Toronto and Greater Vancouver  2 of these international hubs.  While Canadian Governments and agencies at all 3 levels should take reasonable measures to prevent these hubs  through concentration on this emerging hub status    generating economic and social inequality and ceasing to offer rewarding lives for the full range of community members  these measures will not be fully sucessful in isolation.  Success at moderating that hub development and ensure Canada remains a socioecononicly inclusive society requires development in the other major urban centres to become magnets  but at a more human scale  attracting people and a full range of  commercial  artistic and innovative opportunity.,0

Its not the schools job to deal with kids whos parents dont do their jobs. My son was acting out and i was unhappy to say the least they didnt send him home  I have lots of chores for him to do that can fill his time. Dont complain if parents are not doing there job if you dont push the kids disciplinary problems back on the parents.So what if the parents get pissed if you sent there kids home  they should be the ones parenting  not teachers.,0

876,By happenstance in 1967 or 68 I met Jay Hammond at Iliamna when he stopped to put some 80/87 fuel in his Cessna 170. I saw him lifting 5 gallon cans up  then pouring through a chamois filter  so I walked over & offered to hand him the next can. The man was warm & magnetic. He took time to chat a little  tho he had a way to travel. Later  when I was flying to Naknet &other towns to provide dental services  I came to know him.  When he ran for Gov. I flew him around the Kotz area. He stayed at our home  as did Bella. A few weeks before his death  he spent time at our home in Kodiak. We had crowberry crisp for dinner  one of his & my favorites. He insisted that I try on his shoes with springs in the heels. I suggested he could now leap tall buildings. Jay Hammond was one of the 2 most intelligent & by far the most charismatic unique man I have ever known. He dealt with adversaries with humor  wit & poetry. He was always humble. He loved Alaska & we are blessed by his time & actions here.,0

882,This bill does nothing good for Alaska. Nothing. The PPACA required a few fixes in order to work reasonably well for every Alaskan. Simple fixes. Like having a maximum percentage of income for premiums limit apply to everyone  instead of having a cliff cutoff on the subsidies. I don't have a problem with penalizing people that could afford to buy insurance  but don't. I pay (unsubsidized) premiums  I pay for medical services  and I pay taxes. It's people like myself that end up paying for provider writedowns  welfare  and bankruptcies when those that think they're invincible and don't need insurance find out that things don't always go as planned.  If the Senate comes back with some great bill  I'll give Don some credit for being crafty. IF that doesn't happen  then Don needs to take responsibility for his vote  because in it's current state this bill is beyond awful for Alaska.,0

892,Science has shown cancer has a solid link to fructose. It’s the one thing our body doesn’t really need. It gets metabolized in our liver and coats it in fat.  When fructose is fed to cancer cells  it causes them to divide and multiply rapidly. Fructose is in nearly every damn food you can pull off the shelf  and it’s usually in the form of high fructose corn syrup.  Next time you're in a store  look at a label. Look under carbs to see if it has sugar in it. If it does  it’s high fructose corn syrup  and nearly everything food out there has it.  That is the culprit  and the only way you’ll avoid it is by sticking to a diet in red meat  chicken  fish  veggies  nuts and seeds  with fruit sparingly. Which is basically what our ancestors did.  There is a reason why Japan is so low on the list in cancer yet have long lives; their traditional diets are basically absent of fructose.,0
893,Maybe her mother did the same when the organization was founded. Where did her mother think the above ground pool come from? Santa?,0
894,As I stated in my first writing get to the heart of who dictates the schedule  parameters of that scheduling- such regulation of how many officers or rank of officers necessary on duty  budgets developed taking into consideration the entire budget & other items on that budget that have to be met. It might surprise you to find that paying overtime just MIGHT be less expensive that hiring full time officers when you look at benefits  salary  training  etc.. IN addition to that your comments of creating a welfare state are very offensive. When writing an article such as this much more in depth research needs to be included. Such as: what is the reasoning of not being able to hire more staff if the hours dictate it. Is the City growing beyond it's capacity of tax dollars to meet all the needs? Is the overtime in line with other departments & cities the size of Kent. Reporting is definitely necessary. But gather ALL THE FACTS.,0

896,Based on over 38 years of law practice here  including personal experience in cases in which Prosecutor Kaneshiro was involved or in charge  and knowledge of the circumstances of the Kealoha Federal case  it is evident that our least able and least politically independent prosecutor since Charles Marsland has no hesitation not only defending  but even assigning Ms. Kealoha in patent conflict of interest situations.  Not an example for leadership that should be accepted.  The people deserve better.,0

901,I believe that's a very weak excuse for not apologizing over that lawsuit issue.  You provided your  link relating it  to a discussion over whether Prof. Shurtz should sue the UO-- you suggesting that even though I'd lost my lawsuit to Pipes  Shurtz might be able to win hers. But we agree  "Truth is an absolute defense" and I can  absolutely prove I did not lose that  lawsuit to Pipes. But Mr. Motley Crew  you can sit behind your anonymity and make charges that real people have to live with.  Is that fair?,0

904,Hi  Dr. Know (I am not worthy)   Commercial radio repeats "biggest hit oldies." Given the span of recording existance  how is it "biggest hit oldies" isn't a vast body of repetive AirPlay. Here's my comment:  When you listen to a tone along time  the sound goes away.  You don't notice it  like traffic sounds or living by an airport. That way the commercials sound "interesting."

911,Whining about Trump's EO being stopped. Is that acting like an adult?  Crying about President Obama - and backing a congress that refused to pass anything he proposed  not on the merits  but "just 'cause" - is that acting like an adult? The answer is no.  You whined incessantly about Obama's limited use of executive orders necessitated by an obdurate Congress that only cared about blocking him - but it's OK for Trump to go bat shit crazy? Okay. I've got you figured out now. Pathetic. You are a child.,1

915,Same stuff we've read in the Dossier.  It's not a surprise to anyone that Trump has always been an entitled sexual assaulting rich kid.,1
916,Trump and 50 million Americans appear to be more and more idiots every day. You just listen to those who voted for him-case in point the USA ambassador Nikki the other day. "He is our president so he can do anything he wants (responding to Comey firing)" . It appears that to many Republican voters President and God are about one and the same. Scary.,1

That is what America does best....murdering  raping  pillaging and plundering its people by robbing the Treasury and also all around the world murdering people..  And millions of stupid Americans don't see it.  I am so glad I am older and will live to see America fall completely.  Have my single malt Scotch ready for the moment.  America is not great anymore and the whole world knows it!  Nothing has been great about it for many decades...just another sh*thole and sh*t show...,1

924,Did you guys even read his comments? He is all for building new housing but is saying that supply is a long term solution (I agree) and that we are currently dealing with irrational (speculative) demand that needs to be curbed. When markets are highly irrational  as they were in the Tulip  Dotcom  and different housing bubbles  no amount of supply satisfied demand until markets crashed  and at that point the whole economy suffered. It takes 2-3 years to build a new building; implementing curbs on speculative demand takes much shorter  if there is a political will.,0
925,--best response yet to this idiotic "editorial"---having been raised on one of those "family" farms of  60 some years ago   every time I hear that "doing jobs Americans won't do "   I have this fleeting fantasy of forcing the politician saying it to do some of the everyday work done by any farm kid then---,1
926,The flu vaccine doesn't prevent one from contracting the flu. It reduces severity of symptoms and lessons the chances for flu related hospitalization. There are two strains going around. If your symptoms were severe it's possible your doctor chose one strain for vaccination. The best flu vaccine is the quadrivalent which vaccinated against both type A(most severe) and type B strains.,0
927,Agreed. While I'm sure Black wants as much veteran presence in the rotation as he can get  Chatwood's performance is just way too bipolar to warrant keeping him in that spot. In years past  they'd keep a guy like Chatwood in the rotation because there were no better options  but now Black has better options: Senzatela for one  and hopefully Bettis soon.  Chatwood seems much like De La Rosa was when he first came to Denver... plenty of ability  but seems like the littlest thing could cause him to lose focus and if something big happens  forget about it. Not the sort of mental makeup you want when you pitch half your games at Coors Field. I kinda wish DLR could have stayed on just to give Chatwood somebody to talk to about that  because as soon as he harnessed that tendency DLR became one of the best pitchers (especially at home) the Rockies have ever had.  I have some concerns with Chatwood as a reliever too  but that's the best place for him on this team at the moment.,0
928,She is urine.,1
929,I empathize with your situation  S.  It illustrates the insidious effect of foreign capital in a local RE market.  Housing prices in the GTA have little relation to the local economy and local incomes.  The serious cash is coming from outside Canada and outbidding those  like you  who work and pay full taxes here.  Much of that outside cash is relayed through purchasers who won't show up in "foreign buyers' tax" statistics.  Cooperation between prov. and fed governments could lead to proper tracking and taxing of this outside money (see my comment below for details)  but the measures required will upset powerful  vested interests who lobby those politicians:  the RE industry  banks  developers  homeowners hoping to cash in on a bubble and folks who currently purchase RE here without paying much Canadian income tax.  Voters have to insist that the politicians get specific about addressing the quality-of-life debacle that is faced by the vast majority  like you.,0
930,This fellow must have a doctorate in spindoctoring. Never have I read anyone turn so much accepted conventional wisdom inside out and backwards in order to propagate his Victorian world view.    Diversity of cultures and religions must not be allowed to trump science  hard-learned facts that all Western democracies have accepted as truth for decades. The fight for science and reason to take precedence over superstition and dogma was a long one. Let's not go back and fight it all over again.   The G & M and other elites are pushing hard for Canadians to accept two things: religion and immigration.   I won't insult anyone by again spelling out why they're doing this. But  I would ask the G & M not to insult me by their daily propagandizing of two forces that are oppressing millions of Canadians and distracting from economic issues.   And someone should remind him GG Johnston did not connect with Canadians; we hardly knew he was there. He never said anything and never did anything.,0

933,Right. AND for the first time in my lifetime I can do about everything sitting in my comfortable Lazy-Boy  from buying shares at the discount broker  renegociate a loan  take a loan out  have a detailed online report of my accounts. Frankly I think we live in formidable times  and I say this as a senior not very used to technology. But everything is now so EASY. Worth the fees  that is for sure.,0
934,Why are you buying into the argument that there is a conspiracy to ban guns? Did I say that? Did Obama say that? Did anybody but the NRA say that? Of course not. The issue is "what can we do to reduce gun deaths in our country". No one is trying to take your guns away. In the last eight years how many guns has Obama seized?  Zero. Not a single one. I am stunned and saddened that this fear mongering which has proven to be a lie - is still effective today...  To blame gun violence on a lack of morals or a breakdown of society in America without evidence is absurd. Look at any country in Europe. Compared to them  we are a deeply religious  conservative country. Yet they have a fraction of then the gun violence we have.  We can keep our guns and reduce gun deaths. To think Americans are stupid  immorale and not capable of problem solving is shocking. I believe in the greatness of this country and its people. And  I'm convinced reason will conquer fear as we move into the future.,1
935,The question is...do you just not want to socialize with fellow workers after work? There is no set rule that you need to booze it up you can play the designated driver or quietly sip a non alcoholic cocktail or beer.  The fact is you will miss out and being sober you might find you are privy to many issues you might never hear and quite possibly be the only one to remember the information. Also having a drink with the boss and coworkers brings a closeness that the breakfast or coffee meet ups can't. One last thing to remember is you do not have to stay all night.,0

Sending billions to foreign governments then inviting "foreign investors" to create a bank to partially own our public assets is more than just a ponzi scheme it is full-force fraud!  You use our taxes to send offshore then get some groups from offshore to lend us money and have us pay interest to them? That's more than just bank fraud!!   Utter stupidity isn't even THAT dense!,1

941,I'm not really looking at only the last 3.5 months though. I'm also looking at last year too  and the year before  as many of those same players and other elements of the organization were around then too.  What I saw the previous few years was more consistent with the trend of the last 3.5 months of this season than it was the first 2.5 months during the hot streak.  Thus my comment that the hot streak was more the anomaly and what we saw the last 3.5 months was more the norm.,0

And your STUPID comments in trying to say that there may be a difference in legal duty owed to a paying customer vs a non-paying customer are downright LAUGHABLE.

945,Theresa Kennedy-DuPay  as posted to Fred Stewart’s personal wall about 2:30AM on 4/14/2016.  As of 11PM same day  still up and public. (part 1/2)   “So! Since this thread is public and Mark Zusman and the skinny dorky Evil Scientist Mr. Nigel Jaquiss read Fred’s Facebook regularly  I’m curious  what do you two fellas think?  Come on! You can tell us.  You made an old woman cry  didn’t ya?  Are ya happy  boys?  Proud of yourself?  Does this kind of sick thrill make you feel “powerful” like the original Editor of Willamette Week  Mr. Ron Buel asked you earlier?  You made an elderly woman who has already been through more than either of you two out of touch hypocrites could ever conceive  cry.  Wow.  You two slugs really are absolute lowlife  aren’t ya?

947,Not sure why it makes sense to steal money from poor people before exhausting a "budget reserve" that is specifically a budget reserve created exactly for that purpose.   I would love the luxury of running my finances that way. Sure I have $1 million in the bank but if I buy that Ferrari Enzo I won't have what I need to retire on  so I better rob a bank and then get the Enzo and later retire.   Where do we keep finding so many of these people?,0
948,Frack a bunch of shale....,0
949,I would argue that a lot of the reactions here are missing the biggest deal in this story. The issue isn't so much whether Trump is keeping a campaign promise or not  it's that he's explicitly chiming in on what should be an investigation that's conducted free from political interference. Saying  as the president-elect  that he doesn't think the allegations against Clinton should be pursued (or if he had said they should be) goes against the basic rule of judicial independence.  (And before anyone says "But the other side does it  too!" please recall that two wrongs are still wrong. Whichever side I'm on  I'd like to be on the side of the one that actually upholds such foundational principles.),0

958,After all the noise from the media regarding Trump's supposed conspiracy with Russia  I still haven't heard exactly what they think Trump might have done  except for being friendly with them. There is ample evidence from many sources that Comey was not well-liked by many more than Trump.,0

Instead he keeps up with the insults. Sorry but a leader has to find a way to bring people toget her to follow them. What Trump has done is make sure people don't follow him. He is a selfish racist pig. His racist believes should have been reason enough not for Catholic's not to vote for him.,1

Chicago or Boston may lead the pack in North America for the most corrupt municipal governments  but Toronto leads in the most incompetent municipal government.  The thing is  Toronto deserves exactly what it gets since they keep voting in the most incompetent people they can find. Lets face it  idiots support idiots and that is the way has been for years in this city. That disaster down town by the rail yards was predicted years ago and yet the morons at City Hall just kept on handing out permits and the morons kept on buying the condos. There is virtually no infrastructure down there and yet morons keep on buying them.  One last thing is that Toronto is simply copying the idiocy that runs this province.

977,Pride...and back a long time ago  gay liberation are social movements. I do not agree that any one group within a social movement can own it.   Having come out in 1970  I have been part of many marches  demo's and celebrations in diverse company. In 1977  we marched down the Main St of Moose Jaw demonstrating against an appearance of Anita Bryant. Because  we were Euro or FN in origins  are you suggesting we were not fully part of the movement of the day? Or are you suggesting  just the folks of FN origins in our little Moose Jaw demo owned the movement in Canada?   We  they  all of us together are part of a social movement. Suggesting one or two parts of pride  can own it...sends one down a rabbit hole into a world of darkness and 'us's and them's.',0

We were creating a nation and  yes mistakes were made on both fronts.  Let me repeat. That was then this is now.

1005,I have read that HZ increased the diverse voter base  both in the Western Cape and other  which makes sense with her history of being truly nonracial. And explains  in part  her tweet in the context of the obviously racial political and media imbalance. I truly believe HZ is one of the few remaining leaders who has a midpoint balanced approach based on reality and truth....and the courage to authentically voice and stand her ground  out of the status quo!  Clearly  like her  when you live from a "nonracial" mindset  expect the majority of S.Africans  after 23 yrs  to have grown into a similar mindset..to have recognised the obvious   "white alienation" distraction as a Mugabe like ploy for blame and votes...encouraged by the Kathrada April diverse March...realised that the ANC betrayal is the cause of the nightmare we find ourselves in after the Rainbow Nation Dream.

1020,and that's very acceptable at t._i. i believe at i._b._m. they they make you wear a blue suit and uh some kind of colored shirt and a tie,0
1021,From the AMA news letter this morning October 23 they state that Abortions are down 25% since 2008 in the US.  So please  bobramsey   quit making so many accusations with factoids that are simply untrue. I am flagging your post as nothing more than intimidation.,0
1022,there are pros and cons to all things including Canada. as for universal  please go talk to ontario and the limitations they put  its more political selective health care,0
1023,The best remedy for this situation is to employ as many of these "bear spraying cop haters" at $9 bucks an hour ASAP so they can clean up Anchorage.  Can I get a ##$@ YES from the congregation?!,0

1025,I agree with her in the sense that obtaining definitive proof  followed by unilateral action  would have been preferable over such a quick response from us alone.  I sure hope no evidence surfaces that this sarin attack sourced from someone other than Assad.,0
1026,What absolute bovine excrement! tRump and his whole crime family belong in Ft. Leavenworth!,1
1027,He really was a traitor  and his craven behaviour led to the harming of good American soldiers.  Hate Trump all you want  but this man does not deserve anything but prison (or to have been left with the Taliban).,0
1028,Mexico has not attacked the US in any way since Pancho Villa.,0

1030,She was stripped below the waist  and several men raped her.,0
1031,The media don't get it yet again.  What is happening is not Clinton and supporters declining to accept the 2016 results.  It is them taking revenge--against Trump  the media  trump voters  etc.  but  nothing compared with the revenge that would have been taken had she won and had the full power of the government at her finger tips.,0
1032,Just saying our military industrial complex has put a lot of pressure on our housing.  The choice is ours and I feel we made a huge mistake in becoming addicted to it.  Thanks Uncle Dan although this probably would have happened regardless.  Addiction is so easy.  It made sense to cut Schofield.  Sounds very inefficient.  By the time Shofield is mobilized  the war would be over.  lol,0
1033,And I ran - flock of seagulls,0
1034,"You cannot go wrong buying a home." What mind-boggling idiocy. Ask the millions of Americans *still* underwater a decade after the worst real estate crash in US history if that's true. Either this is a troll or your typical realtor angry that the market is correcting even as we speak.,1
1035,And the Alabama right-wingers still plan to vote for a pedophile! The right has given up all claim to morality when they put up with people such as Trump and Moore.,0

1038,.......... and despite Trump saying just the opposite ......... two hours earlier. . What a dotard.,1
1039,The other bad news is the prediction of a steadily declining value of the Cdn dollar . A dollar that is going to buy less .  Currency value is the “silent killer” of our collective standard of living; our dollar declines in relative value by 10% people yawn  reach for their orange juice   and sip a coffee and wonder why things seem more expensive these days.,0
1040,He was running deficits before the recession (a recession he claimed wouldn't happen) and used  one time accounting tricks like selling the remaining GM shares (leaving taxpayers 3.5 billion short of breaking even on the bailouts) to temporarily balance the budget.   How was the US and worldwide economy doing in the 70s? Nothing to deal with there for Trudeau Sr. right? Optimal worldwide economic conditions back then eh? No apples and oranges there right?,0

1044,Stalin may well have been mad but he was not stupid.,0
1045,Facist drivel wolf boy? We have endured fascism for 8 years under The Arrogant One. To wit; Continued repression of petroleum infrastructure construction. Financial repression making it much more difficult to deposit money into offshore accounts  where obama cant get to your money. Financial privacy DOA. More regulations foisted on US corporations than any other pres in history  costing these companies billions to comply with. More executive orders than any other president. The national debt increased more than all other past presidents COMBINED. The very nature of the obama system of governance is rooted in fascist ideals. He is more dictator/king than a president. And your harping on Trump!!!???? Read into the last 8 years more closely before you spout off. You obviously haven't been paying attention. A more patriotic  intelligent  logical  American??? Its ok  we wont hold it against you for being suckered by an egotistical arrogant smooth talking fascist pig from Illinois.,1

1050,And while you're running around calling everybody racist that's the least of your worries I don't think it's so much your race as it is your lack of a brain or maybe the fact that I've seen a better-looking head-on farm animals😂😅🤣👋👎,1
1051,I have REALLY enjoyed watching Liz in every sport she plays.  She has the perfect combo of agility  gracefulness and physical strength.  I also like that she plays different roles on different teams and seems to relish them all equally - She can be the star  the role player  the grinder ..... all with enthusiasm.,0
1052,So we are expected to be close to maxing out capacity in only 13 years once these pipelines are built.  Your argument is that we won't need more pipeline capacity?,0
1053,Low volatility means exactly that. A strategy that reduces market swings on the downside - and the upside. Good for people like me who don't want to trade/time the market. In my portfolio I find ZLB makes a good pairing with CRQ  a RAFI ETF.,0
1054,Thank you  Eric  for your considered and objective response. I think what you experience is probably what many of us do. I know I do.,0
1055,So  it seems 14 CFR 1211 which formalized NASA's policy  responsibility and authority to guard the Earth against any harmful contamination   has been revived in action  if not on the books.,0

1061,Robert- your post appeals to the most sophomoric Hillary sympathizers  and no one else.  If you  given your extensive credentials and history in the field of psychology  want us to take your post seriously  then you must: 1)  Tell us all what the diagnosable disorder is for Trump- also  please let us know where that falls out in the current edition of the DSM. and 2) Why we should let such a disorder dissuade us from actually voting for Hillary Clinton.,0

1064,Same here  just like planned parenthood.  I respect your parental authority  please respect mine,0
1065,You say we cannot afford her - which is true - but you also encourage her to resign. This would give the Liberals a chance to reinvent themselves  pin the ills of the past few years on her  and win the next election (with a bit of support from their deep-pocketed union friends  of course).  Can we afford that outcome?  She needs to stick around as long as possible to command her ship to the iceberg.,0
1066,Colbert.,0
1067,I only fly if I have to and only with a Xanax at that.,0
1068,LFS  in general I agree with your points  which I believe are well-meant  reasonably bipartisan  well-researched and with links to good sources. I agree with your statement that voter fraud occurs  but in vanishingly small numbers  in the hundreds of cases most likely. Several years ago when I read about the five year voter fraud investigation undertaken by John Ashcroft  the DOJ came up with only one example of a local sheriff election in which voter fraud threw the election. I don't think this is widespread at all  certainly no three million people voting illegally  as our president claims. I also know that is not your claim.,0

1071,So that I can shoot somebody. What else would you use a pistol for with a barrel as long as one of your fingers  hunt elk?,1
1072,Wtf ?,1
1073,Definitely a pervert.,1
1074,domestikgoddez: I assume you are referring to "suicide by cop". I wonder how often that really happens and whether it is sometimes used as an excuse to an inappropriate cop shooting. If you have a despondent  agitated  and mentally-confused person involved  do we really know they are asking to be shot by police unless it is documented that they have verbalized their death wish? My impression is that our police are poorly trained in the use of force- unlike other Western European countries  for example.,0
1075,So if anyone felt that they had a problem with this place  just you wait until they transfer the liquor license to the next big downtown gangbanging bar (you know  like the Gaslight  Rumrunners  the Anchor  Platinum Jaxx  etc.).,0

1083,Don't give me any of this PC "possible terrorist" crap.  99% sure it was some jihad crazed Muslim that caused this to happen.  When will Europe learn?  All those Muslims they have been letting in by the 1000's are gonna keep killin' them until the get wise  round them up and ship them back.  As for those already there by birth well that's a whole nudder problem and harder to  solve.,1
1084,Lazeelink - There are almost too many investigations into this matter to count.  They are absolutely investigating Trump and those closest to him  on many fronts.    Granted  there are no conclusions to these investigations yet  but it certainly doesn't seem like they are slowing down - the investigations seem to be gathering momentum.  They don't conduct large investigations like this  or get court orders for search warrants (i.e. Manafort)  based on nothing.,0
1085,PBS LOLOLOL You spew your leftist garbage as if you know what you speak of. You cite government sponsored sources like they are fact You deride perfect logic as if it not  Like all Communists and Marxists you shape truth to your meme using a sophist style that has a feeling of superiority You are nothing but  spoilt child of a yuppie most likely who never got spanked. You are idiot nothing more in fact  you are an Uncle Tom to be more precise You are probably white An arts grad working at McDonalds  You sell out your culture and language for what? You are first to be sent to gallows as a collaborator with the enemy You are no better than a nazi collaborator in fact,1
1086,IT IS OUR HOME YOU IDIOTS. You can't even read a damn map PLUS oil tankers won't fit  the company has been to court numerous times n- for oil spills NOT CLEANED UP here AND operated as Enron in the USA before - and they want to wreck PROTECTED LANDs and it's a new line  it's not for an existing line.,1
1087,China is basically toxic to this earth  from the above fallacies strewn inside this article  to an incredible array of atrocities brought forth on the environment  people  innocent animals  ect ect.  THe list is neverending.  I dont know who to blame......the government  the people  the genetic makeup of this strain of home sapien.  I just dont know.  LIke someone preciently mentioned a few weeks ago.....the CHinese are like the Borg  consuming everything in their way with  their prime directive beingworld assimilation.  And our glorious JT just holds out more welcoming mats.,1
1088,"Leadership of the free world" has come to mean the invasion  occupation and destruction of Middle East countries in order to advance the American Empire and the interests of big business. In the process the US has added fuel to the fire of civil wars and killed a lot of people. Hillary Clinton is a well-known foreign policy interventionist hawk  even more aggressive than Obama. A vote for her is a vote for more war.  I do agree that the choice given us by primary voters of the two major parties is "pathetic"  which is why I'll be voting for Jill Stein. If we keep voting for crap  crap is all we'll ever get.,1
1089,The link you provided is from one of the people directed to disavow the Trump accomplishments.  She gave praise to the Trump Administration just two days ago.  She was trounced upon to change her praise by the Democrats.,0

1097,Not a scandal at all. Unless one gets all of their "information" from Faux News.,0
1098,Omar Khadr is Canadian born and therefore is a Canadian citizen. Are you saying that there should be classes of Canadian citizens or that our government should treat some citizens differently from others? Do different citizens have different rights and expectation of protection from our government?,0

1104,That's a phony characterization. The Supreme Court of Canada already decided what "the right thing" is in three unanimous judgments. Anything other than settling a losing case would be the "stupid option.",1
1105,This article concentrates on the small part of Haldane’s speech where he makes a strong case for tightening UK monetary policy  which probably never should have been loosened to the degree it was in the first place. However the depth of evidence that he supplies for declining union strength  self-employment  the growth of part-time employment and so forth  also pretty much undermines the traditional arguments for a target inflation rate of 2% or higher based on wage stickiness. Unfortunately he doesn’t seem to notice. If Haldane were asked about it he would probably retreat behind  the excuse that it is the Chancellor of the Exchequer and not the Bank of England who decides on the remit of the central bank  including what the target rate of inflation should be.,0
1106,The thing that gets me is that so many are politicizing being a veteran and what that means to this flag.  So many issues need working on that are real in the veteran community and all anyone can talk about is the flag this or that.  Just go to any military base in the states and watch the retreat ceremony at the end of the day to see tons of people scrambling to be inside or in a vehicle before retreat begins.  However whatever message these players wanted to portray is lost because the method of protest they chose eclipsed any message delivered at this point.  I was deployed 5 times in the GWOT and would rather have people talking about actual veteran issues or volunteering for ANY veteran cause than have them bicker over such things on my behalf.,0

1109,Old myths persist despite the science. Artisan cheese is not atherosclerotic--it is anti-atherosclerotic. Indeed  Oxford scientists a couple of years ago suggested that raw milk fermented cheese is what explains the so-called French paradox of low rates of heart disease. Canada's Dr. Salim Yusuf just this week gave a presentation at Davos  Switzerland (available on YouTube) on the results of a massive multi-national epidemiological study finding that dietary saturated fat does not increase risk of cardiovascular disease. Rather  saturated fat was mildly protective and dairy fat  in particular  was notably protective.  lacto-cannibalistic?,0

1114,Loretta Yajima has a vision:  love your neighbor as yourself (quote from Jesus).  In a lost world  we always need reminders.  My stupid parents and teachers always told me "I will not repeat myself  if I told you once  I will not tell you again."   Listen!!!  Typical Asians parents and teachers.,1
1115,Obviously this idiot has a few screws loose.,1
1116,Cost controls on our seriously broken medical system have been spiraling up out of control for decades  and are largely due to our fees for services system rather than being based on medical outcomes. Obama should not be blamed for a system that been in place for over 50 years that has resulted in the highest medical costs in the world (by far). Obama abandoned cost containment in favor of the limited but acheviable goal of getting more uninsured  insurance  and here Obamacare succeeded. Ironically  Hillarycare  attempted serious cost containments during her husbands term  and it was squashed like a bug by the health industry and their political proxies. Until the US abandones multiplayer fee for services  as nearly every other developed country has done  costs can be excepted to keep going up. Blaming Obama for Syria is just as dishonest  as the US has never had much influence or interests in Syria and the root causes go back many decades. Hindsight is always perfect.,0
1117,Get a life ... moron.,1
1118,The Koch brothers win.  Their strategy of pouring millions of PAC dollars into senate races rather than the presidential race prevented a likely shift in control of the Senate.,0
1119,Its illegal asshole.,1
1120,Thank you-can't/won't disagree. But I never said or implied that I am a patriot and I also "back the Confederacy."  I back history-we learn from history. Failing to learn from it or pretend it did not happen opens the door for a 'repeat of.'  I also believe Americans have a right to fly any flag they wish. Includes school mascots. Trying to remove via demands is a slippery slope to removing any freedom of expression and  speech. If  like the Native Amercan school mascots  then if (and this is key) *The Majority* wish it changed  then do so. But only in a majority speaks way. Not via a misguided PC or My Way or The Highway demand.,0
1121,Trying to link any President to current economic indictors is stupid at best and ingenuous on all even numbered  days.   Positive or minus.   Doesn't really matter.,1
1122,Canada needs to be very strategic here. We need to use our bullets where they count the most for all of us.  Not just special interests.  We want to protect (in no order) : 1.  foreign ownership rules in banking  telecom and airlines; 2. agricultural marketing boards; 3. maintain dispute resolution; 4. stumpage differentials in softwood lumber; 5. content limits in autos; 6. limit cross border internet shopping; and 7. oil and gas exports.  It appears Trudeau and Butts are kowtowing to a very powerful Liberal constituency  but not one that represents the interest of Canadians.   Jerry Dias is not the friend of the ordinary taxpayer or private sector employee  manager or shareholder.  All he wants is more money for the massively bloated and overpaid civil service.  Unions played an important role in supporting and obtaining wages and benefits for labour there is no doubt.  But fast forward 50 years and they are disruptive and harmful to society. Especially public sector ones.,0

1127,Trump came to the job as an outsider. He is here to make some changes and of course the status quo  the swamp dwellers can't stand it . Look at them now as it  drains with  the pond scum rising to the top fluttering and writhing and lashing out . Lots of snakes have no where to go.,0

1139,I am 56 years old  I am not your fucking junior pal. What you are saying makes no sense. I don't know what you are basing this on. The cheap black market crap is still coming up from Mexican nationals  and the good stuff from BC and Humbolt.  The I5 corridor is still just as busy  and they are still making a ton of money. Nothing has really changed except that the legal market has made it easy for anyone of legal age to buy it.  And the legal market is controlled by corporate growers with million dollar facilities  or a co-op of smaller growers. The Federal government "war on drugs" really has no impact on the legal market in Oregon. I don't see any glutton of weed  whatever that means.,1

1145,one only has to read the bully comments from the regular liberals here to get an idea. they demand you shut up  go away  threats  etc. if you don't agree with them. no need to name names of these freaks  everybody knows who they are. just loudmouth activist types with little or nothing to do besides complain all day.most of them don't live here  and if they do  they are renters with little stake in anything  but scream about raising taxes so they get a free ride. sick pups.,1
1146,Our readers know it  our journalists too.,0

1148,I believe it mainly comes to do a notion that with a Republican President in office they can "get stuff done" even though they have a sliver of control over the Senate and Trump keeps throwing DC in a tizzy with every other motion.,0
1149,Well  your being presumptuous about what I feel or think Charles.   You've never heard me question white privalage.  I'n sure how you twisted  that into my denying it.     You don't know what I have done or not done to influence my sphere of friends and family.  In short your provided a negetive stereotype for all white men that gave zero regard for me as a person.  That's just being a jerk.,1
1150,What an awful and racist remark. Ever been to a luau? Pork  Poi  Potatoes. This is not "the white man's" fault!,1
1151,This goes to show why those people quoted in Denby's article was shibai.  The legislature is  going into special session to get the tourist to pay a bigger part of the bill. That's the money source to support all government spending.  And we get to foot the bill of the special session. Mufi and Caldwell should pay for the special session.,0

1158,I have seen "burnt" or brown pops in a box before  are they simply trying to set the expectation that there may be a "Burnt" pop in your box?   To see this as offensive is quite the stretch. Do you really need corn pops to validate your PC dreamland?,0

1162,So you do know more than I thought. Kudos to you. Your response to my comment showed a hell of a lot more compassion then your original one  which I responded to. Here's the deal  though - the availability of detox and continuing treatment for alcoholics and addicts is far short of what is required. Until we face the fact that we don't have the capacity to service these people - yet - there are few good options available. The Hope model provides the potential for capacity that we have not yet seen in our City.,0
1163,This pathetic turd should have been on many radars. How does military justice not transfer to federal lists?

1166,Of course Obamacare produced this expansion and of course it should be reined in  but Republicans are still math deniers when it comes to clear increased revenue needed in our state budget.,0
1167,you can babble all you want as is your right  but the fact remain liberals ran PR into the dirt  neglecting PR infrastructure.  while lining their pockets to the point they bankrupted PR long before this hurricane hit. and no  your liberal dementia is wrong yet again  CMD stands for Christopher Michael Dunn. Simple facts always do confuse the dickens out of liberals like you  but I will always say in your defense you ca only work with the IQ you were born with and cannot help being a deluded fool.,1
1168,Yeah I've been in the CNC business for too long and their is a considerable shortage of skilled CNC operators. I think the major reason behind that is lack of awareness among the students regarding career opportunists in these fields. http://tinyurl.com/ychv8w8j,0

1184,Hi Meggsy :-) ... and a horrendous mess it is. Here in the North  services of all kinds are severely lacking  including timely access to legal aid  for the BCfauxLiberals closed down the office in Prince George some time ago. Gordon Campbell hurt a lot of innocent people up here  and Christy Clark carried on the tradition of punishing the weakest Canadians in BC. If only we could get BC Rail back ... but that's another story for another post ..... (sigh),0
1185,Saying you're entitled to your entitlements is an honest truth.     Tell me when you've declined an entitlement as large as Dingwall's settlement or something even close.    Be honest.     Dingwall's mistake (if it can be called a "mistake") was in responding with concise  brutal honesty when he was asked if and why  he would accept his severance.        Most people who still repeat this line as a continued criticism are being disingenuous.,0
1186,"Very unlikely that Canadian building codes would allow"  I thought the same thing. Ontario's PPS is very clear on public safety: sensitive uses (ie. vulnerable sites) are not to be placed near human-made hazards. Municipalities must comply with the PPS but that requirement is being ignored by the City of Toronto  etc.  TSSA has a 200 metre setback requirement for hard-to-evacuate facilities from transmission pipelines. Yet we have a 28-storey high-rise going up less than 50 metres from five high-pressure pipelines  all in their 7th decade of service.  We have excellent regulations but verification and enforcement appear to be non-existent  at least when it comes to transmission pipelines.,0

1188,You could have left out the 'dud for stupid people.'   I know lot's a smart people who carry biased opinion because they never give credit to the opposition.     You did a great job dispelling the factual error  you don't have to be Perry Mason and humiliate the guy siting in the witness box.    Is your goal to vanquish all enemies great and small  or to find a consensus that point's toward the truth for everybody?  Be yourself  I'm just offering a suggestion.    I completely understand the reaction to act 'in kind' to those who are foul and show no hesitancy to ridicule others.     Your persistant investigation and gathering of facts is welcome and that's what gives you real status!,1
1189,How much do outfits like those kids are wearing cost? Do parents have to lay down cash for them? How ridiculous.,1
1190,Your statement most certainly IS a lie. Yes  I do call you a liar. I do so BECAUSE YOU LIE. You lie on a regular basis. The first one of your many that I caught was your claiming that Cardinal Burke's blatantly homophobic "advice" to grandparents to reject their gay children lest the grandchildren not grow up to be homophobes did not show fear and loathing of homosexuals. Yes  he did specify that the gay children should be in relationships  but SO WHAT! It was still showing hatred of homosexuals.   No  Pandora. You are a demonstrated liar  and I continue to call you on your lies  up to and including your lie that I call people liars because they disagree with me  I suggest that you grow up  and start to be honest.,1

1197,Lazeelink  stay on topic  the topic was about Trump supporters not being able to understand how it was rich corporate folk to begin with that created the problems the underclass faces. But hey  you're right  the liberal press did indeed fail to imagine just how many Americans were gullible enough to fall for Trump. Circle back here in 4 years   we'll talk more about the great saviour of the working class and how he made out on that file.,0

1204,http://www.politicususa.com/2016/05/05/dont-succumb-bernie-sanders-electability-myth.html In a general election Republicans would also revel in informing the electorate that Bernie Sanders called for abolishing the U.S. military budget during the Iranian hostage crisis in which Bernie “proclaimed solidarity with revolutionary Iran.” Even though Republicans have had no reason or incentive to attack Sanders the candidate and in fact have worked tirelessly to aid his candidacy  imagine their glee at informing voters that the Senator spent time in Nicaragua in 1985 and joined a Sandinista rally where the crowd chanted “Here  there  everywhere – The Yankee will die.” This list of GOP opposition could go on for a few thousand words  and would certainly include Senator Sanders close relationship with “the Trotskyist Socialist Workers Party  for which he served as a presidential elector in 1980.” I don't know  you think people would want a Commie lover for President,0

1218,And for reference in case my $7.50/hr makes me sound old...I'm technically a millennial.  As for have I "forgone a wage increase". Yes  I did not receive an annual wage increase in 2008/2009 when there was a recession in my industry. I did not receive one in 2010 when I left to re-train by investing in a new education. I also did not receive one in 2013/2014 when a downturn happened in my new industry. You talk about annual wage increases like they're a god-given right. By all means index minimum-wage to inflation as was planned. Don't pretend that skilled workers get the same treatment as that.  And no  I won't give up $1/$2 per hour for a teenager to have a higher minimum wage. They are gaining invaluable work experience. I will and do support other taxpayer funded programs like CCB etc.. for those who have faced more struggles than I and need assistance. I gladly pay help out those who need it. Targeted is key.,0

1220,It's jusy a small group(again)  screaming to have everything their own way.  I don't believe it is healthy for children to be taught that women must take the back of the room when worshipping   but can they not do this at home? Why does the school board only focus on the rights of a minority   fear of being labelled that old m-103 islamophobia name.  So now this trumps any other religion   or human rights?  What a bunch of useful idiots!,1
1221,Absolutely correct.  The facts are that no country can get an efficient and effective health care system through a series of government monopolies.  Canada's spending on health care is pretty much in line with what Europeans spend  but we get longer wait times and far less coverage.  What's the difference?  Every  repeat  every European county has a mix of public and private health care coverage  both in insurance coverage and in delivery.  We need that.  The Romeno report was suppose to fix health care...it didn't.  In fact we have all the same problems now that we had when Chretien hired Romeno to whitewash structural problems in the system.  The Kirby report made far more sense but was ignored by Chretien as he didn't like the results.  So?  We have lost 13 years of improvements due to politics and ideology.,0
1222,The race will always be much faster than bygone days.  Because of grooming  larger snowmobiles and much more trail traffic  traveling on the Iditarod is more like a trip on a frozen white sidewalk these days.  As opposed to the slow  "white sand" trails of pre-Susan Butcher days (she complained loudly when trails were not packed well and she raised the bar on musher expectations of easy trails).  So  there will be no slowing down of Iditarod teams once they are in motion.  The Iditarod puts pressure on the middle and back of the packers to reach the coast by a certain time or be kicked out of the race.  Pressure on B-league mushers is not good for dogs.  Better would be to have different classes: pro and tourist.  Tourist class would allow mushers to remain on the trail for 5 days longer.  Tourist class would cost more to enter to help cover the cost of extended checkpoint staffing.,0

1233,James  Thanks for the heads up about Soros speaking  Esperanto. I spent the rest of the evening doing internet "research" on Esperanto. What is interesting to me is that the Scientology on-line publications are also printed in Esperanto. I still have to wonder if L. Ron Hubbard came to Alaska with the goal of searching out Richard Geoghegan . He sailed up the Inside Passage in 1940 and his boat broke down in Ketchikan where he ended up spending the winter. He said he came up here for a different reason  something about the radio. I wonder if he later came back up here looking for Geoghean.  There is a great story about Hubbard's time in Ketchikan written by June Allen that is on the internet.,0

And of course there would be no danger of either North Korea or China using that as a pretext for increasing their own spending on nuclear deterrence.   Having told the Taiwanese that they are now up for sale  and anyone who wants one can have a nuclear defence   perhaps they will build one too.  The US was well served by the US nuclear umbrella. Now is not the time to be folding it away.,0
1262,Your comment goes beyond harsh to heartless. True  when the lady first rented she must have known nothing was cast in stone  so to speak. However  she had no reason to believe that when the time came to move out  -- no matter the reason -- she would not be able to find similar accommodation at a comparable price. In any case it is a mistake to see this  article as a specific. It is symptomatic of a broad problem  which is failure of government at all levels to ensure an adequate mix of housing to suit all needs.,0
1263,Yeah  when I was a kid  the only time we were home was to eat or go to the bathroom (and sometimes not even then - trees being readily available).  What's changed is the feeling that you can't let your kids out of your sight.    I can understand the fears for young kids in a modern big city neighbourhood but in my neighbourhood - this goes even for older kids.     Eg:   my street is full of street basketball nets even though there is a school with a full outside court 400m away.     When I was a 13/14  my friends and I would go to a park or school to play pickup basketball and whoever was there joined the pickup game.    Games would sometimes get pretty intense  especially if another neighbourhood group would show up.     Now  many parents in my neighbourhood buy these single street nets so their teenage kids play in front of the house.   Always the same handful of kids - never any outsiders - never being challenged - never seeming to ever play an actual game.     It's kind of sad.,0
1264,Amendment IV The right of the people to be secure in their persons  houses  papers  and effects  against unreasonable searches and seizures  shall not be violated.  / In my years in law enforcement  I have never needed to draw my firearm nor use excessive force.  So I ask you - forward several decades now in todays paramilitary LEO's and brink of Martial Law in America - name any other Career where you can shoot someone (simply fire or kill or maim) and get a 2 week paid vacation ? (ie: reward for use of violence) and furthermore  walk away without accountability 95% of the time  even if you fired upon & murder an unarmed/innocent civilian?  This is the issue going on nationwide for the past several years  and the lack of proper training.   Even soldiers on battlefields have stricter rules of engagement!  and most important KEY to this problem is that too many officers take advantage of this entitlement  regardless if a citizen is aware of their rights  those rights still exist.,0
1265,Winco  Walmart  Costco it's all free to me. Who goes downtown except government workers?,0
1266,There are two issues at play here: commercial interests  versus moral concern about food animals' well-being.   Farmers that house animals are using the same arguments that building owners used before the advent of fire suppression systems for human safety- 'It's too costly ' chief among those complaints. Both in the past and today  they point to the fact that private dwellings aren't required to have fire suppression systems. So why would we require them in apartment buildings  office towers or... barns?  It's clear that requiring fire suppression systems in apartments  etc didn't destroy the housing and construction industries. The reason why is that these systems are but a tiny fraction of the overall construction cost  and that cost is fully recovered over the life of the building. In a poultry barn's lifetime it might house millions of chickens  so the installation cost per bird is just pennies. It's not like it's going to send your grocery bill through the roof.,0

1268,I'm just speculating. I like to interpret current events in a way that reinforces my biased world view. However  it would not be jury misconduct. Jury deliberations are confidential and juries do not need to provide a justification for their verdict. Regardless of what the judge says  you have a right (some would argue a duty) to judge not only the facts of the case  but also the validity of the law and whether the law has been properly applied. It's part of the American system of checks and balances.,0
1269,Yes.  players do not need to be better informed.  Those who are mistreated  abused  maligned  or oppressed do not need to be better informed.  It is those who act in those ways who need to be better informed and that is the ultimate goal of social protest.,0

1275,So just how guilty should we be about greenhouse gas?  If I fa-t in the backyard will I kill my Grandchildren.  Relatively what Canada puts out in its energy industry is a tiny tiny fraction of what is put our globally.  So you think removing a gratuitous fraction of global greenhouse inputs from Canada will have any impact?  Sure  kill our GDP and allow other countries to  for example  f-art all they want.  Whoopee we sacrifice our economy just to allow us to say we did so.  This is dumb sh-t and makes us look like idiots.,1
1276,Trump is a racist  and many people who voted for Trump are racists. That's a fact that has been borne out by numerous studies  surveys and polls  in addition to brazen admissions by white supremacists in the Trump base.  What you seem to wish for is that unpleasant facts concerning the history and ideology of racism in the conservative movement be ignored. Forget it. Truth or bust.  By the way  who called you a racist? Name names.,1
1277,I'd also add that Trudeau has for the most part managed to rise above the partisan paranoia and shenanigans of our last regime. He's proven himself able to orchestrate and broker big decisions  in spite of the opposition  with the carbon tax being the best example.   The Libs need to clean up their act about fundraising. (Oh  horrors! Politicians who conduct fundraisers with the actual public!) But all in all  he's a put a fresh  clean face on Canada – something some of us can be proud to present to the world as we continue to open our doors  not bolt them shut.   That's a big step up from the water closet-seeking robot with the teflon toupée that preceded him.   All this  of course  infuriates Trudeau's many spelling-challenged detractors  who'd rather have a Trump-lite I suppose?! Not going to happen  folks.,0

1284,State Assemblyman?  What State do you actually live in Ward?    Certainly not Oregon.  No resident of Oregon could actually be that ignorant!  Of course  anyone who thinks a State official (whatever they might be called) can overturn the Constitution of the United States could be that ignorant  I suppose.,1
1285,The French?,0
1286,The only person that owes an apology is freekeh Rica Wilson.  Mr. Kelly was very kind to this idiot.  She sould be stripped  of her posistion.,1
1287,“We all lose?”  Don’t think so  don’t include me in with you losers  lol,1
1288,What a couple of sad letters to the editor.  One guy thinks Cuba was Heaven on earth under Castro . I guess he doesn't counted the thousands executed by Castro for their crime of only publicly disagreeing with him. He implies Castro did what he did because of the United States .   Then another guy says because Trump was elected he is in no longer proud to be an American. His facts are all wrong concerning Trump but because he served in the peace core and military he wants us to believe his nonsense .  If he isn't proud to be an American   he ought to move to Canada or join the Castro lover and move there .   Under Trump America has hope for real change . 1100 workers had their jobs saved because of Trump---and he's not even in office yet.  Once he's in office we will see so many improvements to America that the nation will celebrate the day he was elected .  Just imagine : lower taxes for all   jobs for all who want them   a stronger military to keep the peace   and so much more .,0
1289,I think that this is very good news!  And kudos to Walloon.  Given the news about Canadians losing 2000 jobs at Bombardier at the same time that they are hiring 3700 in other lower-wage countries  it couldn't come at a better time.  We need to rethink and be more cautious about any future trade deals.  All Canadians need to come first.,0
1290,[noise] there was one here recently that comes to mind that's about a woman that uh this is ridiculous i mean it's almost uh,0
1291,Well eric  I think they're all idiots because they drank the kool aid and  believed the Russian Collusion Illusion for 9 MONTHS.Then when we get CNN on an undercover camera admitting there is absolutly NO EVIDENCE of collusion and the only reason they were still running it was for RATINGS. And yet  here it is two weeks later and people are still screeching "russian collusion"  really thats a big one you need to over.  So far there's aLOT of proof the Clintons collused with russia. 250 million reasons in their bank account paid by  who  thats right the RUSSIANS. Then there's the popular vote  get over it. You DIDNT win the popular vote  and if the states will quit fighting Trumps request to hand over the voter files  which are SUPPOSED to be available on request  demand not necessary.  But of course they will fight that one to the grave  because the over than 5 million illegal immigrants voted for Hillary are going to be overturned and your last gasp "we won popular" will finally die.,1
1292,OK  you don't need to pars it any further  it is obvious: For you everyone is a "populist" whom you dislike or hate. :)),0
1293,Not lazy  just self absorbed irresponsible jerks. They need a shock collar.,1
1294,I think that someone needs to tell the coal miners that Big Coal is not coming back and someone needs to tell you that not only Liberals are enrolled in the ACA. ( and yes millions of Liberal have guns  are in the military  love America ad drink beer).   LOL,0

1302,This is the modern left.  A bunch of thugs and anarchists.,1
1303,Only 3 negative responses! Really! I drove past twice and too bad you couldn't read my mind! Getting fed up with nothing but the same worn out liberal rhetoric being regurgitated in thee letters every week.,0
1304,Better you should leave you loser!,1
1305,So the trumpery in Homer has it in to make damn sure there's not going to be any call for equal protections for all races  types  and persuasions     and you can't figure out why those few minorities in your 'fair' town didn't jump at the chance to put themselves in your angry crosshairs.  Who'd a thunk it?  Right?  Jeebus.,0

1309,The economies of the Atlantic provinces were destroyed by bad government  socialism and equalization payments.,0
1310,I"m curious why you use the word "taxpayers"?  What distinction is it making?  Is the other term in the distinction "homeless people" or something else?,0
1311,Trump  apparently  took so long to make a statement because he was trying to figure out how he can condemn what happened without offending the white supremacists who voted for him.  The statement he ended up making fell far short of the leadership we need.  Sad and pathetic!,1
1312,I love how this paper censor people's comments.  This is just typical of the city and state bunch of Incompetent Dems in charge I do not know what they're doing. So sick of this but I guess this is the way it is since the voters like to keep electing donkeys in charge.,1

1314,Republicans in Hawaii?  That's an oxymoron if I ever heard one.  Booty with his dirty mouth and sick mind talks about Christian values.  Booty and Christian...another oxymoron.,1
1315,Seems like everything that happens concerning vaping is embroiled in ignorance and stupidity. These people apparently don't realize that nicotene is not a carcinogen  a fact that's been known for probably 50 years. They also apparently never read the study by the Univeristy of Maryland years ago that did some experiments with vapists and examining blood constent. Nicotene is VERY difficult to get from the  eliquid into the lungs. My experience is that it is a total waste of money to put nicotene into eliquids. I have never gotten any effect  no matter how strong a dosage of nicotene I vaped. Vaping is THE most effective means of getting smokers to quit  and if anything deserves a govt subsidy  this does. Of course  the greedy govts are collecting fortunes from taxes on tobacco. Gov Pat Brown has put a tax on ecigs   pretending that they are dangerous. In fact  the taxes are because when people switch from cigarettes they avoid the tobacco taxes. Brown is one evil  stupid SOB,1
1316,Time to get rid of all muslims from the Middle East.  Not all muslims are terrorists  but all terrorists are muslims.,1
1317,Pray the child fully recovers.,0
1318,Maybe but you don't need to remember the 1970s to know that there is a lot wrong with neo liberalism.,0
1319,Trump is moving. Campaigning...(still)  going to Florida for golf. Trying to cover up for his campaign people. Trying to "babysit" Nunnes so he can get the latest intelligence information about his people. (still can't believe he gave Trump information about an investigation that Trump is the subject of)...like telling a criminal the police has this information on you so clean it up. Will predict the subjects of the investigation will come up "squeaky clean" now that they know what info. intelligence has on them.,0
1320,cholo has seen a lot of comments immediately blaming the driver while in many cases it's the person caring for the child at the time that probably it more to blame since they let the kid out to run free in a driveway or street unattended. so sad and such a needless accident.,0

1328,Or  you know is it kind of a welcoming tone and maybe there's some pleasant background music or something  just be very mindful of what you are doing to them.,0
1329,You're right about that! I've never changed my mind because someone harangued me or told me I was stupid. Not many people have  I imagine.,1

1332,I always check at least one bag. Included in it will be a second empty duffle that I can fill with items I may purchase while abroad. I can pack what I want when I check a bag including nail clipper  pocket knife and even a declared handgun. I only carry on a light bag with a change of clothes and bare minimum toiletries  in the event of late or lost luggage  with enough space to stuff any extra pounds that may push my checked bag over 50lb. Clear security with my untied shoe laces tucked into my shoes  belt buckle removed and in my coat pocket along with keys  change  watch and wallet. Just takes thinking ahead.,0

1336,Umm. Maybe there was just a massive short position in the loonie. Don't overthink these very short term relative moves,0
1337,You're both right.,0
1338,(Sigh)...Boy-Roy  you have absolutely NO understanding of animal behavior beyond the confines of your pathetic "ideology".  Don't presume to lecture those who do.,1
1339,Of course some baseless nonsense like this would be from Eugene. How embarrassing. People are so dead set on vilifying Trump while everyone else from all parts of the political spectrum realize the clear and dangerous reality that Hillary Clinton could be our next president. I'll take a democratically elected nominee over Clinton. Thanks anyway for your emperor "literally Hitler" gibberish.,0
1340,OH BS!! its wrong PERIOD  your making the same old liberal excuse bs over and over,0
1341,Good article  the earth is flat  and it is great to see Colorado waking up  even if most of the comments on here are the typical garbage diatribe.,1
1342,Correct.  And the guns I saw in the NRA national convention display areas in the late 1940s and 1950s and in such catalogs as the Gun Digest and Shooter's Bible at the time bear that out.,0

1347,Wow Raven33   you just want personal attention or what? You think just because they are public servants  they owed you? I don't know what problem you had but obviously it wasn't very important or else you would have said something. But then  if you are ranting  you can do that. Politicians are all like that you know  be one yourself and you will end up just like her  Stock  Miller  and so on and so on.,0
1348,It serves the town of Brooklyn on the Hawkesbury River.,0
1349,ANY city who protects ILLEGALS are breaking the LAWS that are already on the books and to stand in the way of Police attempting to enforce said laws is not only wrong but is a crime. So that being said the Mayor should be locked up as well as All the illegal immigrants . President Trump is a new power and has EVERY right to enforce the laws already in place but nobody ever enforced!!!! Illegals have raped and killed way to many Americans and been allowed to still stay here HELL NO!!!! They think just because they came here and had a kid that gives them the right to stay HELL NO !!!! They had pleanty of time to learn speak ENGLISH and to become citizens but choose not to so now they can ALL GO BACK WHERE THEY SNUCK IN HERE FROM !!!!!! They have No Rights to be here !!!! I STAND 100% WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP,1

1358,How the Globe can openly endrose a corrupt government is disgusting.  You are pathetic.,1
1359,The lack of education is not because it doesn't exist  but because the voters seek out only the opinions and "facts" that support their viewpoint  and concentrate on irrelevant issues. The voters are politically stupid.,1
1360,Erdogan and Merkel. Now there are a couple of loonies the MSM doesn't pay enough attention to.,1
1361,Trudeau needs to pay the price for his stupidity.  He shouldn't silence the opposition because of his pathetic antics.,1
1362,I think I have witnessed this idiot driver before...speeding  honking  cutting people off  dodging in and out of traffic  I guess her previous violations testify to how she drives  surprised she doesn't have more!  Hope the guy heals quickly.,1
1363,The only time most of us actually enjoy the tedium of the Oscars is when there's a screw up or awkward moment of some sort. I haven't watched the show live for the last decade at least: instead  I now go to youtube so I can skip the speeches and watch the Oscar flubs. Hopefully  the Academy won't try to tighten up the procedure too much: most of us are hoping that there will be many more of these incidences in the coming years.,0
1364,Wow  this is just an upward redistribution of money  take from the needy  working poor  disabled  elderly  and retirees to give to the big oil. The majority in Juneau would rather take from the needy than stand a chance of angering their puppet masters. They know most Alaskans are dumb and have short memory. By tomorrow at noon  most dumb Alaskans will forget this. I would rather they take a good critical and analytical look at SB21. Just as long as we have a Republican majority in Juneau  that will never happen. History shows governments do much better under Democratic administrations than  Republican one.  Sheeple are brainwashed that Democrats are bad for government when history shows otherwise  facts just don't matter to stupid.,1

1370,Stupid is as stupid does. I sure hope Governor Inslee isn't stupid.,1
1371,I am thinking like that.,0
1372,Yeap  Trump loves his anonymous sources  the ones who told him 1.5 million attended his inauguration speech  and the ones who told him about the 3 million illegal voters. Those were "good" anonymous sources---never mind that they're fake!,0
1373,Give us all a break. Where were your protesters when rapist and sexual predator Julian Assange  Russia and the FBI were sabotaging what you laughingly call "a fair election? " You'd be freaking out if it happened to Trump.,1

1393,We're all tribal  we're all in herds. We roam. Remember "can't hold back the hands of time"? It's simple. If you want a life like you remember then move there  they're still around. Otherwise just stay home and watch 'little town' movies on your big screen with your wine and hanky. As I tell myself  "get over it.",0
1394,It wasn't a Clinton email.  Everyone knows you are a liar  and a man without any moral rudder  Donald.  The only people you are fooling are the fools who want to be fooled.  That would make you  not the King of the Fools (that would be Satan)  but a mere fool yourself.  Seek psychiatric counselling.  You have only a few years left to cure your insanity.,1
1395,If this person is really your friend they won’t try to date someone you are with,0
1396,The lower dam was apparently plugged by rafting up logs then submerging them by piling rock on them  to form a latticework plug  of sorts  so why not just dredge them out and let the river flow under the dam  then install a gate to store water for times of drought? The upper dam could have been similarly drilled under to allowed the lakes to refill in flood season  protecting downstream property and then used as a reservoir in Summer. We spent millions of scarce tax dollars for the aesthetics of a "wild" canyon for a few tourists. Once the lakes were drained the dams could collapse in an earthquake with no real harm done  but would likely stand if a seismic sensor automatically opened the drains if things started rocking. Now we have to spend millions more each year repairing flood damage and building new reservoirs  which will likely have their own hazards  and the animals and birds that had come to rely on those lakes for habitat had to move on or die. Idiots R Us. Your tax $ @ jerk.,1

1404,That's not how science works. This research is peer reviewed and published in a very prestigious journal.

1413,Wearing the tax debacle  for sure. Here's a few others they'll wear:  failed electoral reform debacle failed to meaningfully amend bill c51 failed defence procurement deficits well above promises no promised infrastructure  anywhere. Where is that infrastructure bank  BTW? climate change goals no different than harpers cost of hundreds of useless delegates to paris climate conference cash for access failed energy east pipeline disgusting hand out of $10 million to omar Khadr Melanie Joly's bomb on 'culture' Butts and telford's outrageous moving expenses thousands of  presumed haitian refugees flooding across the border a lying defence minister  a bumbling weasling finance minister  several other awful ministers   so much more ....,1
1414,Yeah Right keep doing the wrong thing (thinking its a supply issue) that is not working and hasn't worked and hope for a different result... Stupid argument. Local supply cannot hope to solve a global speculation problem ... this will increase exuberant speculation not tame it. It's become a commodities market  not a real estate market. It will crash badly. Tax the speculation and it will soft land. Do nothing and it will hurt pretty badly  sooner rather than later. The Liberals had their chance and blew it. The Tories are also idiots. Tim Hudak is head of the real estate board. Corrupt and dishonest as they come.,1

Peace in the Middle East   NOT under Obuma 8 years.  300 hundred thousand dead Syrians  yes it's all on Bush - how convenient.   The  Globe has woken up to the Marxist and its failed ideology  change has come. Last on the list of change will be little  potato in 2019.

1427,You can verify and re-record your own recordings before submitting them.,0
1428,Mostly a very good article from someone I usually don't agree with. Art (and art criticism) gets lost when the only criteria is the purity of support for the cause of the day.   However  I think Russel makes a mistake when he suggests the 'left" and the "right" do this in an "equal" amount. The left  generally populating the media and arts world  have a much greater opportunity to apply their filters and to have their filtered opinions broadcast.,0
1429,Donald has mental issues and needs a full neurological exam  including an MRI of his brain.  He's incapable of doing the job because of his incompentence  thus watches hours of TV every day and spends time tweeting and retweeting idiotic and vulgar comments. What a mess Republicans have made.,1
1430,He should be executed. Child rape...deserves execution. ANY rape...deserves execution.,1
1431,They provide 60% of the electricity consumed in the province. How do they do that if they are not running? Solar does not run at night  wind does not run when the air is calm. Nuclear runs 24/7  year in  year out. Turn off 60% of the appliances and lights in your home and only use them when it is windy or the sun is shining. That's your green paradise.,0
1432,Lay off the weed Johann.  The comment about Madonna was directed towards your people.  And snowflakes are the crying libs who have only known the entitlement government led by King Obama.  I guess the saying "you can't fix stupid" is tattooed on your forehead.,1

1440,Even a "tiny-minded  hypocritical idiot" knows that Trump made a pittance of his fortune this way.  He made his money in real estate.,1
1441,I wish the Liberals would abandon these proposals altogether.  But  absent of this  you make some great points.  Too bad I don't think that they are actually listening  except for the few that support them.,0

1444,What a bunch of hog-wash.  Comey has a reputation to be as anal as could be i.e.  making written notes of everything and anything. BTW that is a very good policy  whenever I had slippery bosses  I'd record meetings in writing ... in triplicate  so they had their "very own" copy.  No  those bosses weren't as slimy as Trump  but they certainly had "selective memories".,1
1445,Rat meat and vermin are also eaten by white Americans living in the Appalachian region.

I respect that I am a guest  even with my kids being 6th generation on O'ahu.  I volunteer at a city park  and I've decided not to share Hawaiian creation stories with visitors.  They are not mine to share.,0
1449,"Your charger can produce 2 amps only depending on the resistance of the circuit it's hooked to."  Right  I assume that it may  when plugged into the phone. I'm not sure  but suspecting that the current delivered is different when the charger is plugged into the phone  and somehow water enters into the phone's receptacle while charging vs. only the charger's connector end submerged into the water. Either way  I'm not going to test it. :),0

1460,I run into the issue of being repeatedly asked to judge the same comment all the time. My record is eight times in a row. I assume it's a bug. It might be related to how much comments traffic is on this website at a given time.  I'm liberal and I've also been blocked. It's not a liberal/conservative thing. It's a buggy program with comment-grading algorithms that end up being arbitrary and capricious. I've judged a comment as civil  only to get a "black box" warning that I failed to meet standards and am blocked. If the algorithm is pre-judging comments  why bother with us? Unless it's to train us human beings to the computer program's standards. Not quite "I'm sorry  Dave  I'm afraid I can't do that"  but just another notch on the road there.,0

1462,An important word to understanding the relationship between Mr. Trump and those around him is sycophant.    Sycophant | Definition of Sycophant by Merriam-Webster www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sycophant Merriam‑Webster parasite  sycophant  toady  leech  sponge mean a usually obsequious flatterer or self-seeker. parasite applies to one who clings to a person of wealth  power  or influence or is useless to society <a jet-setter with an entourage of parasites>.  A man as egocentric as Trump surrounds himself with sycophants....I might use the term "#@$kissers".  It's not unusual  most politicians  entertainers and athletes have them hovering around them.  Billie Bush was  in my opinion  an "$#@#kissing punk".  A man like Trump needs the validation of such people to bolster his self-concept.  If the people around him would  instead  confront  him about his obscene  boorish behavior  perhaps he'd change.  More likely  he'd just find new sycophants to have around him.....very sad,0

I'd like to see the average person pay for that $250 000+ kidney transplant they shopped around for."--It's telling that people arguing for single-payer always use the most extreme healthcare cases imaginable when claiming that price transparency is pointless  but act completely baffled by the concept that modern hospitals should be able to set up a website that lists the costs of their services.  The lack of price transparency is one of the biggest factors in the rise of healthcare costs  and it's come about because the federal and state governments refuse to enforce existing anti-monopoly laws.,0

1484,Remember when the gas went up a few years back from the mid two dollars to the mid four dollars and everything in the stores went up due to the high price of fuel supposedly and did those prices go down when oil went back down  NO. Now the stores will raise the prices and blame it on the gas going up and will they ever go down  NO. Used to drive to Anchorage for a few things from Costco and fill up but now people can come to the valley and fill up. You people in Anchorage need to quit complaining about everything  the politicians love it  sure you can have this and that  all we have to do is raise the taxes and of course the assembly being politicians will accommodate. They will get your money one way or another and who benefits  the big stores who send the profits out of state. This will really help the big pickup boys with the heavy feet especially the ones that go every day to Anchorage from the valley  might see a lot more electric cars in Alaska so the car dealers can raise prices,0
1485,3/18/2017  Concerning the flooding in Bothell we have lived here since 1994 and been through all of it and I found a lot of information out on our own between our homeowners association and the city of Bothell we keep getting the same answer they're pointing fingers saying their hands are tied   we need 2 storm drains in our neighborhood they have not been serviced for 20-plus years the water builds up and runs right all them and through our houses I have personally taken City of Bothell employees back there and show them the drains. They said there's nothing they can do I thought the homeowners association giving them the okay but then the whole intersection says it's the city's problem so here we sit with ongoing flooding not saying it'd be a total fix but it would clean up 75% of the flooding.

Alaska is not like the lower-48.  All Alaskan natives are both US and Alaskan citizens  subject to the laws of both the US and the State of Alaska.  They have no sovereign rights.

1542,A couple generations of multiculturalism have left English Canada without any identity or any ability to function as a coherent  cohesive community.  It’s not surprising that such a nothing of a society experiences so much angst when we see the Québécois behaving like normal people in normal democracies.  English Canada may be incapable of asserting any culture or commonality  but nobody beats us when it comes to SJW outrage and politically correct hysteria.  Good for the Couillard government and good for Professor Leclair.  Quebec is a separate nation within a loose and fragmenting federation.

1555,This IS an assault on judicial independence. How are we to know whether the "training" is legally accurate  or if it will be infiltrated by SJW ideology that runs contrary to the Charter and other actual law? Also  the bill makes a list of judges who have not had this "training" - this is a scare tactic to bully judges into relinquishing their independence and simply convicting more people in order to avoid negative consequences from the government.  The other MAJOR threat to judicial independence these days is the media  and social media. I'm looking at you  Globe and Mail. CBC. CTV. etc. Journalists will print stories about an acquittal and try to summarize the ENTIRETY of evidence in a single sentence  and then invite the public to shame the judge. This is the true threat to the judiciary - a public not versed in the law (e.x. the legal nuances of "presumption of innocence" and "beyond a reasonable doubt")  being egged on by the media to go on uninformed witch hunts.,0

1559,I was mostly referring to whoever it was that deemed my comment of  "god forbid Natives have more access to quality higher education"  as uncivil. I am just aware of what took place at the town hall-style meeting that occurred at the end of July regarding the tribal acquisition of APU.   From what I've heard it sounded like a lot of "they took our jobs" type of mentality and racism being cloaked as concern for a weaker curriculum  faculty  and overall educational experience. I have a feeling if this article had come out before that meeting took place  the main argument would have been much different and more in line with Nancy's accusation.,0
1560,The editors know well what draws people's attention. The facts  however  bear scrutiny. This nugget sheds important light: "The Toronto Real Estate Board said a key reason for weakness in the average sales price in August was a change in the composition of homes sold in the month  with far fewer higher-priced homes sold compared to a year ago."  Rather than celebrate the slide in "average" home prices (what a ridiculous term anyway. What does a house in Etobicoke have in common with a house in Rosedale apart from walls and floors?) people should weigh the cause of the drop against Toronto's expectation to grow by 2.5 million new inhabitants in the next 10 years.,0
1561,I was referring to those people  who wish to walk the thin IRS line  of Federal Incarceration.  You are either  a make believe Tax Lawyer or a make believe CPA.  It is easier to become  a make believe CPA  by studying the USA Tax Code Book  than a Jail House Lawyer.,0

We had to work hard for what we got.   Both of us broke our bodies to the point that we can't work anymore and are on disability. We only make the equivalent of $6.86 an hour and you have the ordasity to bitch that you cant live on $9.47 an hour?? You say that I should just go out and get a part time job? Don't you remember what I said? We are not physically able to and it's illegal for us to work and get disability at the same time. It's all going to be taken away. Thanks King county!!!!  I would go to the liquor store and take up drinking  but once again thanks to King county  I can't do that either because they voted for us to raise the booze prices 50%..,0

In my case post WW2 we made fire crackers out of explosives in anti-tank grenades ....... really - without killing ourselves. So this child soldier bit does not resonate with me at all. The deeper question might be: who allowed the Khadr clan to immigrate into Canada ?  The legalities ? Is this a case for the " Not withstanding clause " ? I think the ccontroversy is not so much about the judgement but the award - $10 million. And to lay this debacle purely at the feet of the evil Conservatives is stretching journalistic integrity. I think Trudeau owns this outcome - at our expense.   Surely there are worthier recipients of such largesse !!,0

1572,You can travel freely in the ethnic Tibetan regions of Amdo and Kham.  Tibetans understand the limitations of their freedoms quite well  and although they are wary of publicly challenging the Chinese narrative or showing any orher dissent  surprising numbers will honestly say that quality of life has improved dramatically in recent years and that in private they're allowed to live essentially as they please.  There are fears of Han migration   assimilation  and historical distortion   but they also see daily life mproving  traditional aspects being re-encouraged  and even concessions like being able to put the Dalai Lama's portrait on open display and to freely disseminate his speeches on wechat. I encourage you to visit these regions and in a private setting discuss the situation with Tibetans themselves.,0

Trump Ameica needed a PM with the ability to pivot   Trudope just marched Canada  into oblivion with punitive taxes   we are now grossly uncompetitive with our largest trading partner. Health care and all our social net needs a minimum 3 percent GDP growth.

1577,Kakistocracy is a term meaning a state or country run by the worst  least qualified  or most unscrupulous citizens. . The word comes from the Greek words kakistos (κάκιστος; worst) and kratos (κράτος; rule)  with a literal meaning of government by the worst people.,1

1584,Right. There was no banking system in India. In fact  there was no trade or gold or diamonds in India  according to the knowledge you have (in contrast to the actual fact that India was the only country in the world producing diamonds till the 19th century A.D.).  Here is an another fact. All the colonial wars the British fought in the 19th century were financed by the Indian taxpayer. But the benefits of conquest went to British companies and government and citizens.  When Queen Isabella financed Columbus  was it with her good wishes or her capital?,0

1590,Great thoughts and I admire your commitment but I think your missing some fundamentals. While the left is busy protesting and complaining the right does what it always has - get up and go to work. And in going to work they earn enough to live on (hopefully) and the govt takes the rest - a portion of which finds it way into the protesters hands enabling them to not be at work. Until I see a march thanking people for paying taxes I remain unimpressed.,0

1595,The sky is falling  the sky is falling.  A high school science student maybe able to recognize global warming but isn't able to discern the difference between global warming and climate change.  There is a difference  a huge difference.  Climate change being continuous  ebbing and flowing  cooling and heating  expanding and contracting  changing.  Global warming is an event like now which has been going on for the last 11 000 years.  Some how a graph showing a downward trend of the Greenland ice sheet over the last twelve years is proof of anything "is stunningly dishonest".  Shocking as it is the Vikings lived in Greenland when there way less ice then currently a thousand years ago.   Was it global warming or Climate change?,0

1604,Response to your comment on HC and abortion: In April  at a Meet the Press event: she said: "The unborn person doesn’t have constitutional rights."  A few days later on the View  in response to Paula Paris' question that "... at what point does someone have constitutional rights  and are you saying that a child  on its due date  just hours before delivery still has no constitutional rights?" HC further elaborated: “Under our law  that is the case  Paula. I support Roe v Wade.”  She talks about a "person" yet she treats that person as just a lump   because that is the law  and she fully supports it.,0

1620,The median salary for a nurse practitioner working in Eugene is slightly more than $100 000. Given your age  experience and educational background  you're likely making top scale in your county job. If you're not  it would be helpful to know why not. There are five job listings for NPs on the county website. Step 10 hourly wages range from $50.33 to $54.17  or from $104 686 to $112 673 per year in salary. Your career has taken you from Florida to North Carolina to Oregon with many employment stops along the way. Please explain how you are being unfairly compensated. Thank you.,0
1621,The shots of Djous HQ after the first printout said it all - they knew they had lost this election and all the spinning by Ben and Vicki Cayetano  along with Sam Aiona couldn't put lipstick on that pig. An anti rail candidate has yet to win en election besides Ann Kobayashi in Manoa  which is basically a legacy vote that couldn't even translate to her son. Why the antis seem to think every year 'is our year' is beyond me. The casual voter that shows up for the general is way more likely to lean D  and way more likely to know who Kirk Caldwell is. That  combined with Carlisle's voters should put Caldwell at 55 percent come November.,0

1626,I agree Jack   and think you will find that this problem is not only in found in Vancouver.    This sounds very much like what is happening in the rest of the country for the majority of the population.  The problem is double dipping...having to pay income tax AND consumption tax.  With the current state of our tax system  there is virtually no meaningful discretionary income left over to handle the cost of every day living expenses. It is hard to sell more taxes if the cupboard is bare.   Let's give all working people a break and abolish income taxes.  Income taxes were first introduced as a temporary measure to help with financing the federal government's efforts to  help our allies in the  1st World War.  Time to repeal that law.  Then perhaps introducing taxes for other causes would be more palatable.,0
1627,Emmanuel Macron issued a statement inviting scientists from around the world to move to France if they want to continue their necessary research after Trump's cuts to environmental agencies.  It would be a shame if Canada loses its best scientists  but that's certainly one option for them to consider.,0
1628,It is no less cruel to allow animals to starve to death by over-grazing than to allow them to be harvested and eaten.  I would think a wild horse living in a pen would be the ultimate in suffering.  I see no compelling reason to not allow horses to be slaughtered if there is a market for the meat.,0

1634,There is an enormous difference in the level of carnage.  The episode in Edmonton caused little harm in comparison to the bloodshed in Las Vegas.  Why?  Because the guy in Vegas had access to no end of weapons and ammunition.  The editorial dumps on Trump  not because he has failed to fix the problem  but because he failed to even mention it as a problem.  At least Obama had the decency to mention that gun control is a problem that leads to episodes like Sandy Hook.,0
1635,It doesn't matter what anyone thinks of Trump. Griffin's so called "humor" depicting a terrorist act....one that goes on daily in the world of terrorists...is disgusting and more than a little twisted. She should be ashamed of herself.,1
1636,These statues simply are wrong.  Having these things up as a memento to history would be like putting up statues of the 9/11 terrorists or Harris and Klebold at Columbine.  There's a difference between written history which simply documents and event and a statue which is used to honor an something.,0
1637,I really don't see this happening.  Before the city could force people to take an alternative means of transportation  there would have to _be_ a reasonable alternative means of transportation.

1640,Nope  the climate will still attract people and jobs. Growth will only accelerate  as the people from other parts of the country don't know and don't care about Colorado's water issues. People who have more valuable skills will push those who don't out. All of us want a piece of Colorado  no matter when we moved or were born here. Living in increasingly crowded Colorado is still better than many other parts of the country. Our live and let live attitude only helps attract more people.,0

Ownership is a media conglomerate that uses Your Js as filler to sell subscriptions  et al.  A winning team really helps with all that.  Stuck with a lot of past-their-prime players whose contracts repel other GMs.  Nobody wants Tulowitzki nor Martin  so by default you are stuck with these horrible contracts for 2+ yrs for guys who're already past their best by date.  Staying the course  mostly be default rather than design  it's just prolonging the inevitable.  You hafta get younger  faster  more slash-and-dash over the next 2/3 yrs.

1644,Well I see that one of my comments to you was downrated for "incivility" or just plain gang censorship. Good work anti first amendment people.  There is no such thing as clean coal. Cleaner coal is a possibility but even taking the entire tops off mountains to get at the coal is too expensive to compete with the vast surplus of natural gas. Market forces have made coal obsolete and I believe trump knew that when he lied to the people of Appalachia that he would bring back those jobs. Power plant owners have already made the switch to cleaner natural gas. The coal industry is a thing of the past. Clinton promised to create jobs for the unemployed miners with training programs that are the future. Trump lied and got the votes. People are so naive and gullible that they would accept the hollow promises of a man who promised they would not have to move into the future while Clinton was honestly telling them that a better future was possible in spite of coal mines closing. Reality sucks ey?,1

1666,How about this for hypocritical  MUCK?  Hillary Clinton strategist Bob Beckel appeared on on Fox calling for the assassination of Julian Assange — a blatant urge for violence against the Wikileaks founder in direct contradiction of every possible natural and government law.  Wikileaks  of course  has published several damning caches of documents showing Clinton in none-too-favorable light — including emails from her controversially-employed private server as well as communications from the DNC which proved her campaign colluded with mainstream media.  “I mean  a dead man can’t leak stuff ” Beckel chillingly noted of Assange. “The guy’s a traitor  a treasonist  and … and he has broken every law in the United States. The guy ought to be — and I’m not for the death penalty — so  if I’m not for the death penalty  there’s only one way to do it  illegally shoot the son of a bitch.”  Senior staff writer for Politico Michael Grunwald took to Twitter to compound the madness.

1667,"... Oregon’s federal forests are more valuable left standing for the recreation  tourism ..."

How about speaking out against Trump's voter suppression commission  his violation of the Emoluments Clause  his unreleased tax returns  his inability to even appear sane?   Coffman keeps voting for the backward policies of the so-called Republican Party and that means he owns the mangling of health care. After seven years of criticism  the Republicans spend like one week on "crafting" a replacement? The Senate version of this disgrace is getting 17 percent approval from the American people. As for the House version  first Trump holds a Rose Garden celebration  then he tosses Congress under a bus.  Coffman is toast and he knows it.

1683,'Fiduciary Duty' is actually about putting the client's interests first.   So  for instance  our hypothetical financial advisor (not 'adviser' which which has too many financial regulations attached to it) would not put Grannie into a speculative resource fund even though he/she would earn a higher commission on it.   Personally  I think these 'Financial Advisors' ought to be required to post a big sign on their wall:                                  'WE PUT OUR INTERESTS FIRST                                        AHEAD OF THE CIIENT'S",0
1684,No one can argue that the climate is changing.. But to say you can't argue that MAN is causing that change is pompous and arrogant.. And can be absolutely argued.

1697,Touched my heart - maybe more like a punch in the chest. My Son  Sam  died almost two years ago after a long and fierce battle with cancer. He was 25 years old. Samuel was raised in Fairbanks and loved Alaska. He went outside to college and was an active duty soldier when he passed after coming home to Ft. Wainwright. Sam's wife was by his side through chemo  surgeries  bone marrow transplants  and radiation.  They are the strongest young couple I've ever met. He rallied for a short time and was a part of President Obama' s security team on his trip to Africa. Sam was an EOD specialist. He was strong and proud  loved rugby and tattoos  and he was a loyal friend  son  husband and big brother. Being out on the river was a favorite place - we brought him there to say goodbye. Your Sam story - like mine - was bittersweet! Never forget.,0

1703,“Minutes later  Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan  also headed toward the Capitol  said he would have no comment on the vote or his plans until after the policy lunch.” Yeah.  Gotta get his ‘party before country’ marching orders first.,0
1704,Donald Trump is a world class a**hole  racist pile of crap. Has to stir the pot with N Korea  refuses to acknowledge PR and the USVI  tells black athletes they don't have first amendment rights after calling them sons of *itches  supports nazi protest in NC  calls mexicans murderers rapists? Anything I missed? He needs to go skull f**k himself with a giant rubber *ick.,1
1705,This poor soul will be poor no more! In the lawsuit that will be filed this week  he will collect several millions of dollars in about a year from now and will have plenty of money to travel  around the world. And just to rub their face in it...he should fly United ! Good on ya mate... take em for everything they've got...you're entitled ! When will these stupid corporations learn ?,1
1706,A loser from where??? Arizona??? How did he migrate to Kona? Should we build a wall at the airport??? Rapist children pornographer  bad hombres.How do we keep him out of our land??? Hope the local prison population have their way with this fresh meat.,1
1707,I pity the fools who voted for Kathlene Wynne.,1
1708,Dear John: You don't seem to understand preferential voting. Unlike first-past-the-post  the effects of vote-splitting are not as dire.  As long as the anyone-but-Bernier voters put Bernier on the bottom (or off) their ballots  eventually someone could beat Bernier. (I say could  because if the voters are allowed to not rank all the candidates  as candidates get dropped off the list  the total number of valid ballots will fall and Bernier's 1st-place votes will take on a higher proportion.)  In this specific case  if voters who mark Scheer #1 mark O'Toole #6  while voters who mark O'Toole #1 mark Scheer #6  there is still a decent chance one or other will win.,0
1709,And I stand by MY comments..Corker is a no-good rino piece of dung..good riddance you nincompoop..just wish we could oust you or recall you now rather than have to put up with you 'til next election!,1
1710,Wow! Seven years of conservative thinking produces a plan that is more expensive  provide less coverage and will not help increase the quality of health care for all. No surprise there.,0
1711,They're not George W Bush wannabes?  Why aren't we using that talking point any longer?  Stale dated?  Fresh fear mongering is more palatable for you?,0
1712,How dare any Canadian question the ethics of Justin le Roi !!!,0
1713,Tommy Cotton is just being a good senator by supporting the local industries!  When he's not trying to keep Arkansas aircraft factories a-churnin' out war machines  he's trying make sure that the labor for service  poultry  tourism  cotton  and rice industries stay docile.  So far  so good...    But looking back in order to make Arkansas great again  Tommy boy  is a well-proven dead end.  The last time Arkansas relied on the plantation economy  its labor supplied by a "peculiar institution"  Arkansas caused itself to fall behind economically and socially.,0
1714,Which would be where in Alaska? Anchorage which is heavily dependent on Federal Dollars? What exactly is the economy of Anchorage? Please tell me how Anchorage will survive if the federal and state $$$ dry up?,0
1715,I agree Pocho   I'm fed up with the politicians too.  But honestly  I'm really more fed up with the ***** grabbin"  liar  lol,1
1716,Aren't Gaffney  Cline & Associates deeply appreciative of their contracts with Alaska Oil companies?  Are they really a neutral party to this discussion?  Will they be any more balanced than Michie  Meyer  Millet  Chenault  Hawker  Saddler and the rest who have direct financial interests with the oil companies.  More great ethics examples from the GOP.  Why don't the just bring back Bill Allen and Randy Ruedrich and the 9 sent to prison and let them write the oil tax law  be done with the shame of "democracy" and toss what little left of any so called ethics in Juneau.,0
1717,Hhahahha... we have now reached critical mass stupidity. Write a historical figures name that G&M don't like and you get censored. If I write Winston Churchill  that won't get censored I'm sure. But if I write K__________i  wooooooo....,1
1718,And are there other groups that better align with that?" Ellis: Well  Nadia  thank you so much.,0
1719,One point probably referenced elsewhere: Apparently Mr Singh did refer to the Quebec nation.  This differs from the carefully nuanced House of Commons resolution of  Nov 27  2006 which stated "That this House recognize that the Québécois form a nation within a united Canada." It satisfied many nationalists but annoyed the separatists among them.  Mr Singh doesn't appear to notice or care about the distinction.,0
1720,Do you know that China is Germany  Japan  and Vietnam's biggest trading partner? Both Germany and Japan are exporting a lot to China. Vietnam is receiving lots of Chinese investments.  Now let's talk about Afghanistan  Iraq  ...,0

1724,So it took 3 professors to come up with this apology for the Ontariowe electricty debacle ?!! Are any of them electrical power STEM professionals ? Apologies but I am entirely unimpressed. There is no financial analysis behind the claims beyond superficial statements about the time value of money. Have the authors ever heard of inflation ?? Governments printing money and thereby devaluing currency so they can pay off debt with monopoly paper ?! The reality is that Ontario has completely bungled the electrical energy portfolio .... Not worth any further comment !!,0
1725,Quit your whining  Oskar. Dirty cops should not only be disrespected  they should be incarcerated.,1
1726,A)Quebec could use the notwithstanding clause of the charter B) no ones religious freedom is being impinged upon  you can believe what you want wherever!  C) only during certain requests for public services must you show your face. A reasonable request in a society of humans where we both engage with people visually and also demand confirmation for identify for certain services and at certain times.  Religion is only a belief  it is not based on any reasoned objectively verifiable sets of data or even universally reproducible theories. It is faith based belief in the supernatural. Thus  although allowed in our society and is not repressed in any way  some of its more silly 'sincerely held beliefs' can be curtailed at certain times for the benefit of the secular public space  so as not to disadvantage or advantage one group over another. A secular government is important to avoid favouritism of any creed as is availing oneself of certain services.  Believe what you want in your own time,0
1727,Is it not amazing. The pathetic few defending her gross dishonesty and corrupt morals only reveal that they are the same  and therefore not worthy of being citizens of the US. As a matter of fact most of these blowholes dont even live in AK. Its quite obvious from their silly comments,1
1728,So the TDS addled Left is still going with that one?  Yeah  Trump is so "stupid" that despite being vilified by the MSM for almost two years he became the most powerful man on earth.   Wish I was that stupid.  So what does that make Lil Kim or you for that matter?,1
1729,If the dentist pay scale is too expensive for the average private sector workers then  including mouthwash with fluoride through the medicare system would be a good alternative for low income families.,0

1734,you always just well i don't know like i had an old friend who use to read cosmopolitan all the time and i thought it was the most ridiculous magazine but it was just so interesting to find out i don't know about the culture of people who read cosmopolitan you know,1
1735,So you get your information from Russian intelligence.,0
1736,Hello   Is anyone else realizing that Justin is just as much a politician as anyone else? The only difference is that he smiles when he lies and takes his shirt off once in a while. Are anyone else's blinders falling off?  Sunny ways my ass. It is the same old same old.,1
1737,Does this also mean those that promote their "cause" in order to continue getting funding?  They also have an agenda.,0
1738,Mysteries solved!,0
1739,How would you decide who deserves health care and who does not? Just the size of their wallets? What if they are too young to have jobs? Or disabled to the point that they cannot work? How do you decide? You could solve the whole issue with one sentence. How? Who?,0
1740,Don't let G&M reporting stand in the way of the truth  Schmelter (do you pronounce the underscore?). Remember that "reporting" is based on law enforement "reporting " a practice largely dismissed as a form of the imaginary in Killer Weed: Media  Grow Ops  and Justice  by Susan C. Boyd and Connie I. Carter (U of T Press  2014). But then  to you  maybe peer-reviewed acadmeic research isn't "reporting?",0
1741,Hey you absolute morons in Ottawa  this is wrong and Canadians are appalled. Can someone get Justin's head out of his GQ magazine and let him know.,1
1742,You too huh  What is it about entitled Muslim hating angry crackers that EVERYTHING in their pathetic lives revolves around oppression by Muslims and the left?  It's clear you're suffering white entitlement and need bad guys to blame for your own serious deficiencies  Take your bias  insincere outrage  bogus sources and ignorance to a KKK meeting where it belongs,1
1743,Let's be superficial  and just pity those poor philosophers  huh? Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party for as long as we can  you know  like small  idiotic school children.,1
1744,No  we agree about that.  Trump is far worse,0
1745,Challenges means getting out of your comfort zone; and that is always a good thing.,0

1747,This person could have killed with other weapons.Gun control is ridiculous.,1
1748,So you think there is no chance any of these alleged 'bad cops' could have been tried in state court? I know plenty that have.  Perhaps the reason is that there was no evidence of criminal activity?,0
1749,and CBC is a forced subscription the Rebel is volunteer.,0
1750,I disagree. I'm just as apposed to 'lists' without due process and recourse. That said  I think we agree that due process should be the first thing addressed and then people would be more supportive of the inconvenience. I understand guns aren't an inherent threat to society. But they are lethal tools that we need to regulate  have processes over and due process when our system fails to protect our civil rights.,0
1751,as usual you idiots live in the lie of mans carbon destroying the world well loser its not.  you are the ignorant one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bi2QKY3zW8Q,1
1752,Trump's performance at the press conference was thoroughly disgusting.  In patronizing tones  the buffoon suggested that puerto ricans did not have it so bad because they didn't have as many deaths as hurricane katrina victims.  Then saying how much relief efforts are costing?  Did he say anything to texas and florida officials about the cost of their relief efforts?  Of course not  because they are voters  unlike puerto ricans.  Sad and pathetic!,1
1753,Good humor!  Yes  shoganai -- nothing to do about it  so quickly accept it and move on.  In truth  I enjoyed Steven Mark's review of Sakura Terrace  and look forward to dining there.  With sake  of course!,0
1754,Wow!  You nailed it!  Been there! My MIL lived with us 8 months.  She was a very kind  sweet 80-year-old at the time who was very much close to my husband.  I was the one who was jealous and I knew that.  They were planning a 2-week vacation for the 3 of us.  I kept telling my husband to go with his mom by himself.  No  he wouldn't go without me.  In a nice tone  I kept asking him to go without me and enjoy himself.  He finally decided he wouldn't go and seemed happy about the decision.  Yes  she commanded his love and devotion but it is important to allow them that.  Soon enough  she will be gone and you want to feel you did your best.  I think your husband will appreciate you for it and if not  you will at least celebrate your having done the right thing.,0
1755,Please cite the source for your re-offense rates.  Multiple studies put the recidivism rate at around 3 to 5% for sex offenders.    https://www.smart.gov/SOMAPI/sec1/ch5_recidivism.html  Have you ever stopped to think about the real fact (not paranoid fear/imagination) that these people are denied housing  jobs  and the general freedom to lead a normal life after getting out of prison?  Have you ever considered the fact that the endless state-sanctioned harassment from law enforcement and parole officers coupled with the most malicious hate from the public drives these people underground?  It's not about dodging the registry just to be sneaky and devious.  It's about just existing without all the constant stress and cruelty.,0
1756,Hopefully my accent doesn't show through.,0
1757,Are you referring to the allegations of collusion between Trump's campaign with Russia and Russian interference in the election?  The investigations that are still ongoing in Congress and under Special counsel Mueller?  Just a quick google of Mueller shows recent reports from WaPo  Bangor Daily  CNBC  The Telegraph  etc. etc. etc. all less than 24 hours ago.,0
1758,I swear if you listen to some of his "native issue" interviews he has a very distinct "accent" while in other more literary ones he does not. I have said this for years.,0
1759,IF we had national leadership on Pipelines; one to the west  one the east  one to the north combined with Canada Energy (oil and Natural Gas for Canadians first and export at world price) there would be no problem. But we have no leadership at the federal level so every special interest group feels they have a right to say something. And we all know  they want money or the big fat envelope. This is the consequence of no national leadership. As I used to say at work; "talking about an issue is code for doing nothing"' as a result nothing gets done and taxpayers money is wasted. Take NB for example we have a 100% liberal MP's in NB  not a word  no strategy not a thing  meanwhile  we import Saudi Oil. How does that make sense  as we pipeline our Canada oil and Natural Gas to the US at a hudge discount. How stupid is that!!!!!. So stupid we even have Justin supporting Keystone. Imagine the PM paying off his US buddies as if it mattered.,1
1760,What about concealed carry for all ?  You ain't. Nothing special,0
1761,Way to go.  That will show Trump.   You just made yourself dumber than you were before,1
1762,The hardest thing I ever had to do was quit smoking. The addiction is powerful and long lasting even a decade or more after quitting. Tobacco companies claim to be "legitimate business" right up there with alcohol and fast food but all three are killing millions.,0
1763,Agreed - thanks to Democrat legislation and policies.  The Trump administration and Republicans are working to change that.,0
1764,Actually  you've got the quote wrong. It's `To gild refinèd gold  or paint the lily'.” You could look it up.,0
1765,those are very likely situations. the majority of communities in Alaska are isolated and have access to only 1 school. Even communities on the road system like Tok  Glenallen  Valdez are separated from private schools by great distances. In order for a voucher system to work in the majority of the state (not Anchorage  Fairbansk  Juneau  Wassilla)  private schools would need to be established nearby in order to allow parents reasonable access to more than one option.,0
1766,If the hospitals are doing community benefit work for less than their costs  shouldn't they be losing money rather than building large cash reserves?  If the numbers they are using are "real"  then they must be they are charging more than their costs for other services  much more by the sound of it.,0
1767,It is all in the G&M's role of being of the multicultural police.  Everything is A OK with having people come in to your country and ...  Well can't say anything more.  As the 3rd Reich is out there to censor us.,0
1768,My name gets messed up all the time....and I have the same first name as our prime minister.   Get over it..stop looking for problems,0
1769,Houston is flat and is designed to handle 15 inches of rain in 24 hours.  In this case we got 30-35 inches overnight.  It is great to watch a community and country come together in an awful situation.  It is a reminder that this country is not falling apart.  Proud to be a Texan and an American.,0
1770,I expect you to die.,0
1771,He was born in Paris  though his parents returned to Britain soon after.,0
1772,What do you mean back to the public? The airport is a stand alone enterprise that hasn't/doesn't use public money (although it profits - and it's remarkably profitable - are used for the public's benefit).,0
1773,I've ridden and crashed a motorcycle. Adding excess speed just turns an accident into bad judgement. These riders often show off their bikes on their Facebook pages  along with the the kids they leave behind. Sad that his kids will now just have memories of really cool dad.,0
1774,A fraud and Hungarian Nazi who had no business in government  Just another con artist and blow hard with fake medals like Sheriff Dave Clarke,1

1776,Oh yeah  sure...kiss his legislative agenda goodbye ???!!! Go crawl back under your rock  you idiot!!!,1
1777,What an ignorant and useless article  not everyone prefers "cheap supermarket cake".  My little boy has a rare auto immune disease that requires diet restrictions  yet we don't choose Kelsey's & Applebee's as our dining choices (shame on you for bashing those who do should that be their preference or all they can afford for a special occasion).  We love that our kids enjoy a variety of dining experiences including fine dining and should I need to bring a special cake in that my WHOLE family can enjoy than that should be my prerogative at any restaurant.  In a time when so many suffer from all types of allergies & dietary needs  and when food is such an emotional and sometimes painful reality for so many  shame on you for making those who may not have a choice but to bring their own feel that they are lacking in class or "selfish".  Globe  you lost my readership for printing such garbage.,1
1778,I speak from experience  and have been in several close call fender benders because the fool in front of me wasn't paying attention to traffic and the light turning green  and was busy handing $1 to a social parasite professionally begging. AG Loretta Lynch stated illegal aliens were OBLIGATED to work our jobs when they travel here because no one has the right to leech off others to get out of their obligation to work and support themselves. I expect mentally challenged people  especially liberals  to fail to understand the 1st amendment does not empower others to harass people for money to get out of their responsibility to look for work and support themselves. This is why I stick to private property  business who can legally throw these bums out. I don't expect people like you to understand the dignity I and my Chickasaw family have when we were homeless.,1
1779,May I borrow your bolster?,0
1780,Right wing nuts are stupid. Proven fact. Liberals  in the other hand  aren't.  I guess that makes them a little harder to fool and control  eh  Herr Fuhrer?,1
1781,Because you have millions of people and tourists purchasing weed. Take Alaska's  population  minus children  drug testing employers employees  government employees and how many people do you have to purchase weed? Maybe 200 000 statewide? Those 200 000 people are going to purchase enough weed to create a billion dollars in  revenue? Sounds like a pipe dream....,0
1782,Should have just ran his useless meth head ass over.,1
1783,I'm guessing you don't understand how American elections work.,0
1784,Drove to Dawson city this weekend. There was a dead bloated moose just south of Tok. Guess they missed one.  Didn't hear anyone complain about that one being totally wasted.,0
1785,You sure spend a lot of time trying to examine what's in peoples pants  Kylie.  Creepy.  Checked your own lately?,0
1786,Bahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha. Sucks to be a hypocrite. And to those who would defend him  shame on you as well. Or is his  Murdoch's  and Trump's behavior the new norm? Sexually abusive and lairs? So much for demonstrating Christian values.,1
1787,Yes I'm related to the victim. We wonder the same thing. Why would she hurt an innocent child by breaking bones in his foot and burning both hands with a hair iron. I'll tell you why! She's a sick twisted monster who has been abusing the victim for whatever her sick minded reason was. There doesn't have to be a reason and no matter the reason she conjured up in her rage she ABUSED BURNED  BROKE BONES . Why was she told to stay away from the child. Answer is stated above! She was also to stay away from her own children per agreement of her release. That hasn't happened! We have no idea how this paper got ahold of this story as the family of the victim has try to keep this from coming out until after the trial. The under age child was 2 at the time. What could a 2 year old do in any circumstances to justify this abuse?.... answer not a fucking thing!!!!! Just to update this monster is no longer in custody in Lane County Jail!!!! It really sounds like you are on the side of the abuser!!!!,1
1788,She looked in the mirror and was excited at what she saw.,0
1789,Hard news is hard to take.  The best way to do it is to be straight.  Gotta give the Governor that.  He isn't blowing smoke.  Want to cut the budget by the amount of lost revenue?  Close down the highway shops (which has been happening)  cut assistance to muni's and school districts (which is occurring - watch out property tax payers)  let the roads go to pot because there is inadequate capital funds to rehab (which is one of the first things that happened).  Start with the services you use in your local area first.,0
1790,The dumbest stories get the most comments.,1
1791,Thank you for helping to elect Trump.,0

1795,You are a complete liar!  Support your 'facts' StewartBrian,1
1796,The 3 hour fan edit of Lynch's Dune is pretty excellent if you can find it. Theatrical edition awful  2hr20 extended edition still flawed but the 3hr one great,0
1797,Such a stupid statement - China does not print truth - it prints what the Party calls truth!!!!,1
1798,Saying idiotic things is a right. That doesn't make them less idiotic.,1
1799,Considering time value of money-- this is actually less of a strain on EI as the same payments are paid out over a longer period.  That allows monthly EI payments to be lower  hence keeping the EI fund at a larger amount for longer.  All that assuming that many families even take the 18 months.  I feel it's not for everyone  but there are instances where Mother and Father can find a good use for it if their own work benefits line up properly.,0
1800,No my response is because I cannot stand to listen to or read the stupidity of others.   It's a personal subject to me because every time a man raped me he wasn't watching any pornography.    In fact one of the guys who tried and almost died was a teenager who'd never seen any porn in his life. He was just a sick twisted b@stard.   Stop with your fake agenda on why you feel someone rapes a kid.  Because those of us who were victims don't appreciate it you waffle!,1
1801,Ryan may be smiling now  but he and McConnel are pathetic. These two idiots had 8 years to find the weaknesses in Obamacare  design and test a replacement plan. What the hell were these two idiots doing for 8 years? He can raise all the money he wants but it will not buy votes when these two idiots do not produce. The President would be wise to dump the two of them and get someone in that produces for the American people. Congress  on the whole  is NOT! By now they should have had the tax bill passed and infrastructure working. This is why I'm for cutting the terms of these fools  and that goes for the Godless  perverted  Party of Death Democrats like Schummer.,1
1802,Missed the point  bub  if you find the US so oppressive  you have the "choice" to look for a better place to live.  Or like many Americans  you dig in and work hard to make your life and the country better.  And I don't accept your assertion that "the majority says we don't have a choice".  I would propose that US citizens are one of the most mobile of any nation in human history...and therefore exercise their choice with few comparisons.    Yep  I do call his act a tantrum and I don't view his little tantrum as a valid or effective means to making this country better.  Nope  never said that that those who work hard with determination should be thankful to others (but I am thankful to my family and all those who have helped me in many ways over the years).  But since you brought it up  I think we should be thankful that we live in a nation that allows those attributes to have the ability to flourish.,0
1803,Let's say a business owner wants to increase profit. They can hire cheaper labor until they hit a wage floor.  If they pay low enough  those who are paid poverty wages will be subsidized by the taxpayers in the form of social services. When people know they can take a job at say Wal Mart  they can work for less. Shall we remove all social services and drop the minimum wage to let the market work? A business owner can keep their prices low by using automation to replace workers. If govt. keeps the wage floor at a certain level (min. wage)  the owner has incentive to automate. Not all products or services can be automated and still sell  but look what is happening with automated check-out. Other inputs can be lowered. The owner may be able to source them distant places where labor and environmental protections are less. If the price stays the same  the owner can raise wages or take more profit.  Automation replaces the cheapest workers. Shall they compete with machines for wages?,0
1804,The Law of Karma.  Such dipodal leadership in America. In Obama  we saw the better nature of these people; Obama cared for OTHERS. Under dufus (rhymes with POTUS) we see America it its worst: arrogant  ignorant and selfish.,1
1805,Morneau does not get it. He has no statistics to back up what he says. He needs to get serious about  these family trusts. They should be abolished. Talk about tax cheats! Morneau is right   we all need to pay our fair share  and it should start with him! Time for the ultra rich and entitled Canadians to contribute to the welfare of the lower and middle class Canadians! Most of the doctors and small business owners in Canada are middle class. This govt. has tried to lead a parade / charade chastising physicians for being rich! Nonsense! We need a tax revolution to go after manipulative rich people like Morneau and Trudeau. Such nonsense  so pathetic.,1
1806,"Standing" is one of those words developed by the US Supreme Court a couple hundred years ago which is used to either decide or to refuse to decide cases filed in those courts.  Either or both of your comments may have relevance to something in our customary universe  but certainly not to this lawsuit.,0
1807,I think that God will put up with a great deal more mockery than you give her credit for.,0

1810,A sad state of affairs repeated too many times in Iraq  Europe  the USA ... and there was an attack yesterday in Edmonton  Alberta's capital.  While the politicians rush to make statements about being 'shocked  but we stand together'  it is time to review why it must seem so easy to commit these crimes in western nations where the rights of the 'alleged' attacker are paramount to the application of laws.  Do such attackers find the legal system weighted so much toward their 'rights'  plus opportunities for media coverage  that it has become a 'sport'?  If any of these people do intend to become a 'martyr' for their cause  then they are NOT worrying about 'the law'.  How can such people be vetted  no matter where their radicalization occurred? There has to be a more appropriate penalty for disrupting and/or destroying innocent lives. Politicians need to be MUCH clearer about values that unite and underpin the fabric of THIS society.

1812,This procrastination on the part of the NCAA has multiple negative consequences on the UH... and still they have these other penalties handed down on top of that.  Craziness.  I wish the UH would sue the NCAA.  I can't believe an organization like the NCAA can exist without checks and balances.,0
1813,I can't imagine that this could possibly be a good thing.  The stories of ill-thought environmental tampering are legion; Australia suffered greatly because of non-native rabbits  and still deals with an overpopulation of cane toads.  We shouldn't de-extinct species just because we might be able to do it.  The variables involved in determining the impact to the biosphere are so complex as to be completely unpredictable.    These kinds of undertakings seem to be more about bragging rights for scientists than they are about making a better planet.,0
1814,In my limited knowledge of the details of the NFL  I always think anytime the opposing team scores more than 20 points  our defense did not get the job done and anytime our offense scores less than 21 points  they did not get the job done. That's my personal demarcation line.  I hope they don't even consider Kap because he's just too toxic for Denver fans  myself included.,0

1817," A cursory view of the daily news shows that violence and disruption is not exclusive to the left." Then it should be easy for you to give examples of the right doing that - using violence and disruption -  to shut down free speech on campus in support of your claim that the right is responsible for a third of those occurrences. Yet in all this time you haven't. After numerous requests to do so.  The only reasonable conclusion is that you can't.  Why is that? Is there some conspiracy to hide these violent episodes by the campus right? In the absence of some explanation for that failure it is reasonable to conclude that the reason you cannot provide examples of right wing violence to stifle free speech on campus is because it simply doesn't happen.,0

1842,Children in Shrewsbury attend Webster Groves and Affton school districts.,0
1843,The fact is that slavery was common practice in a lot of cultures up until the end of the 19th century. For example  the Ottoman Empire engaged in slave trade through Crimea for Slavs.  It was the industrial revolution that killed the demand for slavery as much as any great human enlightenment.  The big difference is that you do not hear 6th generation  fair skinned  blue-eyed Turks whining about it. It is long past time for both sides in the US to move on.,0
1844,Minnery and his ilk are scum.  I'm tired of wing nuts wasting state resources--almost a million dollars wasted to litigate a special interests law that they should have known was unconstitutional if they were competant lawyers--attacking our constitutional rights.  They need to quit trying to turn our country into a theocracy and respect everyone's rights  not just that of a few.,1

1849,AMERICA'S IMMIGRATION LAWS DOPEY!  No one can enter the USA without proper paperwork  a work visa  green card  etc.  You cannot just walk across our borders  (as much as you Socialists would like it to be) and just 'become' a citizen of America  wake up!,0

1851,I can remember from the late 70's and early 80's climatologists talking about how with El Nino etc that there would be years where we see high temps in areas that are normally cold and very cold temps in southern areas that are normally warm  nothing new for news here if you have read news reports in the past. Not arguing that it's not happening but sure is happening faster than they have seen in the short history they can get from ice samples world wide.,0
1852,There are Federal laws that govern the release of information  especially information pertaining to private parties.  The privacy of others who may or may not have affected wells is paramount.

1860,Serial killers are hard to detect  some are in good standing within the community  and unlikely suspect.  But they do make mistakes  and they can be lured into the opening.  Robert Hansen Case was very difficult case  and the ones who were involved with the case were concerned citizens-made of different ethnic groups.  I had three Anchorage Police Officers contacts:  Gunnery Sargeant Charles Cunningham and his son Willie  Field Coordinator Lt. Paul Honeman  Lead Homicide Detective Sgt. Dan Sullivan.  Robert hansen was apprehended at the Alaska Vocational Technical Center  Seward  Alaska.  It took AVTeC female Students  a instructor  staff  Department Head to help Chief of Police-Seward Police Dept.  and Sgt. Dan Sullivan arresting the suspect.  For me  I was a lead homicide detective undercover  and a bate.  I would have been his 18th victim  but ultimately prevented.,0
1861,They always were. If you donate $100 to some political party you got a $75 tax rebate.  For an additional 25% the people of BC might see a huge blow to influence peddling behind closed doors and a refocus of BC politics back to *their* interests above all others.,0

1864,I have never met the man but John Horgan strikes me as being very disingenuous and shifty.  Furthermore  I'm not at all convinced that even though he is the leader of the NDP  he is actually in control of the party.  If there's truth in that  the choice facing us between Horgan/NDP or Clark/Liberal is really a matter of choosing the least bad of a very bad lot.  Or maybe we end up with a hung Legislature and the Greens holding the balance of power.  Hmmm.,0

1880,If we banned the words idiot and moron there would be no way to describe these m----ns,1
1881,Trump displayed a mastery of media manipulation throughout his campaign. Most of the mainstream media spent the majority of their time reporting on his activities and statements  rather than reporting on his opponents. And  until late in the campaign  few of the media bothered to question the veracity of his comments or to demand concrete detail that would support his positions. His campaign will be a case study for prospective candidates for decades to come.,0
1882,Then they aren't credible news sources  are they?,0
1883,I found many sites that said the same thing  I tried to find one that would be read.  Clearly you didn't read it.      Your analogy is absurd.  A nation with a sovereign currency  is not your family budget.    But think small if that suites you  otherwise pick a source that can provide a real world perspective.     You apparently are so convinced that it's a problem that you really don't want to research for facts.     1 year ago when I spent a night looking for information  I thought the same things as you did.   Evidence proved otherwise.  Try it sometime.  I'm not your caretaker  you can google  you can educate yourself.    It will mean more to you that way anyway.,0
1884,What is truly disturbing is that an individual appointed as a judge could have such poor judgement. Whether one supports Trump or not  the idea of wearing politically-oriented clothing into a court is just plain stupid.,1
1885,Excellent article in today's NYT:  "Trump and the True Meaning of ‘Idiot’" https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/12/opinion/trump-and-the-true-meaning-of-idiot.html  To quote:  "In ancient Greek society  an idiotes was a layperson who lacked professional skills. The idiot contributed nothing to public life or the common good. His existence depended on the skill and labor of others; he was a leech sucking the lifeblood from the social body. Related to this  idiocy (from the root idios  'one’s own') was the state of a private or self-centered person. This contrasted with the status of the public citizen  or polites  such that to be an idiot was to be withdrawn  isolated and selfish  to not participate in the public  political life of the city-state. In Greek society  the condition of idiocy was seen as peculiar and strange (a meaning that is retained in the English word 'idiosyncratic'); thus 'idiot' was a term of reproach and disdain. ..."

1889,I'd lean towards saying that AST is on the hook for policing the area. While Girdwood is inside the municipality  the MOA can't force APD officers on Girdwood unless Girdwood accepts the alteration to the metropolitan police service area. The city is expressly barred from altering it without a vote of the affected people.  AST however is required under Alaska Statute to police the whole state regardless of anything else. Therefore if a crime were committed  AST would have the statutory requirement to be the lead investigative agency.,0
1890,It appears one man is sure spending a lot of time speaking another mans words.  It makes one wonder if Sen. Richard Blumenthal is attempting to gain prominence within the anarchy of the left.  I believe Neil Gorsuch can speak for himself and as an American  he is entitled to his opinion whatever it may be.  I agree it is sad to hear our president making a derogatory comment about a Federal Judge as it is for a Federal Judge to rule based on politics rather than policy.  Here is a thought; I pity the next president-elect if he or she is of the Democratic party for they may rest assured  they will have hell to pay and what we are seeing today will pale in comparison.  Is this what we want our political leaders to continually focus upon rather than the business of the Country.,0
1891,Trump was also correct when he said his inauguration crowd was the largest. And that Ted Cruz's father was responsible for Kennedy's assassination.  A person who supports a liar is.....,1

1894,Saunders is a huge weasel. Barks "racist" at his globalist opponents. Brexit? Racist! Trump? Racist!   His type are putting Jews in a jackpot. Last time robber barons plundered all the wealth out of the economy causing economic collapse  people blamed the Jews.   This time around euro-oligarchs created an empire to impose neoliberal reforms and globalism on a continent of largely social democrats who would never vote for the policies. See "Robert Mundell  evil genius of the euro."   What this means is that when people find out what happened many will blame the Jews. Of course  the Jews are not European aristocracy. They've been the whipping boy of Europe since Constantine.   My guess is that robber baron sociopaths would rather Jews get blamed for destroying the Western economy than themselves. While weasels like Saunders continue to polarize and obfuscate the debate to protect upper crust criminals.,1

1916,The adult leaders will probably be behind the kids  with their weapons pointed at the kids to make sure they advance. Maybe the snipers can get them. The troops in the foxholes will have to kill whatever comes at them.

1922,No  money doesn't always win. In fact many laws are designed to prevent just that.  But that's neither here nor there.  7-Elevens don't pay stipends to nearby residents.  Neither do schools.  Or grocery stores  restaurants  banks  hospitals  or any other development.  And in nearly every case they're far more disruptive to nearby residents -- more traffic  more noise  more crime  etc.  There's a few months of activity when it first gets drilled  but no more than construction traffic to build a store or a school.    I live in southern Weld County.  There's half a dozen well pads within 1.4 miles of my house  including 2 new ones going in as we speak.  I'd MUCH rather have those going in than a store or a school or another housing subdivision going into those fields.  Well pads are far less obtrusive than development that brings lots of people and lots of traffic to the neighborhood.  Especially after year 1  where for the most part it just sits there quietly producing.,0

1930,Wrong.  Your fundamental belief is wrong.  Consent must be ongoing.  Once she is incapacitated by alcohol (her blood alcohol level was over 3X the limit  incontinence and witnesses) she cannot consent.  Even if she consented earlier when she was capable  the moment she become incapacitated  there is no consent.  Just because she got drunk doesn't give anyone the right to assault her because you consider her behaviour to be bad.  Being drunk doesn't mean she lost her rights to self autonomy.  Your comparison is false equivalency.,0
1931,' …something on the table.  Praise for something on the table.  What's on the table?    A proposal to give the legislature more public money.

That case dragged on for four years (while Clinton was serving as President) before it was finally settled in November 1998 with a check for $850 000:  Clinton mailed the settlement cheque to Mrs. Jones  even as he braced for the heaviest fallout yet from her harassment suit — an impeachment trial in the Senate.  To finance the settlement  the president drew about $375 000 from his and Hillary Rodham Clinton's personal funds and got the rest of the money  about $475 000  from an insurance policy  a White House official told The Associated Press.  "This ends it. The check is being Fed-Exed" to Bill McMillan  one of Mrs. Jones' lawyers  said the official  who spoke on condition of anonymity.,0
1955,Was on a flight from anchorage to Juneau a few months ago  first class is filled with our legislators not one in coach that I could see.,0
1956,Exactly  and yet Democrats will try and have us believe that a person who has not shown any effort into becoming a legal citizen will follow every other single law we have if we just give them a driver's license.  That's like a drunk driver saying if you just let me drive drunk all the time I promise to obey all the other laws.,0
1957,Hey,0
1958,Sobriety would also be a good first step to ending rape on reserves.,0
1959,That is just a lie. It takes long and more vetting to come to the US than most any Western Country.  Look how fast Syrians got into Canada while here they still were working paper work.,0
1960,Klastri  the hard evidence that a FISA warrant was issued has not been made public  but there have more than enough reports in the anti-Trump media that says one was issued.  If you can't believe the New York Times  the BBC  and the Washington Post  who can you believe?,0
1961,I've been a patient a few times under a few different circumstances in the last 15+ years; when I was younger for birth control because I thought that's just where people go  I also had a pregnancy confirmed there because my job kept me traveling and out of state 35 weeks of the year and more recently I needed to check on ovarian cysts and that's where I could get in quickest besides the ER.  Never has a visit been free. Regardless of my employment or insurance status over the years I've had to fill out their gross income sheet to determine fees on the sliding scale and have had to pay the estimated cost of the visit upfront before I could be seen.  Neither link you shared provids any prenatal medical care. HMHB is in-home counseling  nutrion education and they help find a provider and transportation for outside medical care because PP does not provide that care. WIC is a national program for financial assistance and food coupons. It has nothing to do with PP itself.,0
1962,I am a bit mystified. My big 5 bank gives me chequing  drafts and money orders  credit card (if I cared)  unlimited ATM   debit and interac transfers  safety deposit box  overdraft protection (if I cared) and a USD chequing account with no fees ever. All I have to do is keep a minimum balance of 5 000 the opportunity cost of which is equivalent to about $4.10 per month (less than $3.00/mo in after tax terms). The real issue in my mind is small business accounts which are more like $25/month,0
1963,Thanks for totally outing yourself as a racist.,1
1964,Bombardier and the familiay that owns it has always used taxpayers money even though that family is so rich they could have fronted the costs themselves but always conned the taypayers via politicians to use our har earned money to overpay workers and give executives huge bonuses when they even had bad years,0
1965,He certainly looks insane.,1
1966,Mr. McCain  you don't speak on behalf of this country when overseas without the consent of the President or the State Department..... To that end  shut up.... You are a very bitter little man that couldn't win a presidential election and know one listened to your support of another candidate in 2016 - bitter old man... Just  shut up and don't put your long history of public service in poor light now coming to an end.,1
1967,Hes just a liar  he has nothing else better to do then go steal peoples cell phones cause they are addicts  I'm so tired of people defending this sick pervert. He gets caught so he's going to try anything and say anything to make himself look innocent  which that's not the case cause he definitely was caught with it in his residence. He's going to play the innocent card and im not a thief card  which hes down graded these "addicts" for stealing but what do we call him if he's not an addict. It takes one to know one and I think he is a thief and I think he did post them on their secret site and i think he's a pig and I think he is a horrible human for blast people's nudes on his stupid site just to prove what that they are addicts really?? How are you going to prove that they are addicts over looking at their nude pics he's a nasty pervert that need to get help or something cause you just don't go around blasting peoples private parts on social media. I have no pitty on him at all,1
1968,Good!!!,0
1969,Well  do try to control yourself darling.,0
1970,Interestingly enough two GOP strategist who don't support Trump pointed out two possibilities.  1.  Steve Schmidt who was McCain's campaign manager predicted the GOP would split along similar lines as you see in Britain with the GOP being the mainstream centre-right party like the British Conservatives and a new alt right party would form where the Trump supporters would go much like UKIP in Britain and despite this split the Tories still won as that made them more acceptable to more moderates (off course Labour veering far to the left which he left out also probably helped too).  2.  Another Rick Wilson stated the GOP is damaged goods so he is hoping to start a new conservative party that would focus on conservative values but would be open to minorities (many who are conservative but don't want to be part of a racist party) and this could reach out to conservative Americans who the GOP has burned bridges with.,0
1971,I was a patient for many years  so was my mom  dad and brother.  He never did anything but treat us all with respect.  I would see him again if I could.,0
1972,What is appalling is how long it has taken to even get the GOP to this level of divorcing itself from the lunatic fringe(s).  And I mean the teaparty as well as the Trumpkins.  Some like our own three GOPers have yet to distance themselves from this disgusting circus.,1
1973,This is wonderful.  Loco weed mixed with Booze is a major cause of accidents here.  I just love the North.  Get High up North!  Alaska- North to the Weed!   Oil-Weed-We have went to Seed.   It's a Wild Weed City.   Anchorage- It's a Weed City.   Oil-Weed-Fish  We have it all!  Land of Weed and Gold  Black Gold  Alaskan Weed.  Green Weed-Alaskan Gold. Hire me for your advertising slogans!,0
1974,I'm going to smoke pot just to make this fair. Ten years ago we had just as many stoners as we do today. DUH. For decades the police have had to be trained for impairment  which included pot. DUH. We have spent hundreds of billions of dollars on prohibition that empowered the black market  and caused crime to increase. yet a simpleton like you fails to grasp youre profound stupidity has lost the war on drugs  people no longer buy into your refer madness lies/propaganda  and it totally sucks to be you. On behalf of the stoners of Oregon  thank you for your ability to continue to humiliate yourself in public for our entertainment.,1
1975,Steve My claim that the US medical  not health care  system is the best is based on frequent references to people travelling to the US for treatment.   Yes  the US health care system is probably the worst. Not surprising. There is no connection between the medical system and 48 million (PRE Obama) Americans. Outcome is certain to be poor. Make that connection and the results are certain to improve.   Another point is the performance of government run systems  not just health care. The Communists showed that government running everything does not work.   Many countries using public sector health care  including Canada  have troubles.   With health care in the private sector everyone choses their own level of health care. You select what you can pay for. Those who cannot pay even the lowest level would need help. Financing this would be possible from all the funds not needed for people who pay their own way.  US data suggests that only 17% of the population would need help.,0
1976,The dumb-and-proud mentality is way stronger  way more mainstream and way more pervasive and shows itself in so many more ways  on the right. There are probably 3 000 talk radio stations in the US which spew this garbage 24/7 to 300 million people. There are what maybe 10 universities in canada where this stuff has happened  involving what  maybe a few hundred people?  In any case  they are totally different things. The campus incidents are driven by sensitivity to perceived racism  sexism  etc. They are not driven by anti-intellectualism. In fact  they are the product of intellectualism. That is the opposite of  Republican hatred of knowledge.,1
1977,Governor Walker can line item veto the senate president  but only if he would.,0
1978,37 plus million dollar damages? Thats more than bldg is worth! Owners pulled a major con and are the scammers of idiot legislatures that dont read fine print on contracts.,1
1979,Income on business savings is currently taxed.  What is being proposed is a punitive tax as if it were paid out to a high wage earner.  Then when it is actually paid out (in wage  dividend  or sale of company) it is taxed again.  You are right that a large pool of working capital is a bit like an RRSP for businesses.  Unlike an RRSP  its earnings are taxed immediately at the small business rate.  But like an RRSP most of the tax is deferred until it is pay out to owners.  Unlike an RRSP  it is available to the company at any time for business purposes (similar to withdrawing $20k from an RRSP to buy a first house  but way more flexible).  A punitive tax on working capital income would incentivize owners to withdraw it and invest in RRSP's instead.  This would make their companies less flexible and have a significant impact on business investment.,0
1980,Senseless tragedy and prayer for all affected.  Of course we don't know details but there seems to be a problem at that intersection with yielding to oncoming traffic when turning left.....  several years ago my husband was in an accident at that intersection when he was traveling north on Glenn and a young driver  16 yo  going opposite direction turned left in front of him.  Thankfully no one hurt in that accident.  There have been a number of accidents at that same intersection with similar scenario.,0
1981,Maybe if Kaepernick was a wife beater or rapist or leader of a dog fighting ring  he would be welcome back in the NFL.,1
1982,I get the feeling that the government is taking direction from the media. Pathetic.,1
1983,Everyone should have the right to education.,0
1984,If you want Bernie's revolution to move forward consider volunteering for  and donating to  Ocasio's campaign!  No rich folks and corporations will be calling the shots for him.  No establishment political machinery there either..,0
1985,But it was only an image of its former self.,0
1986,your really think palast is legitimate? Sure send him some cash he loves it,0
1987,I think we all agree that there is surely a need for certain highly skilled tech workers.  Also for English speaking  educated immigrants.  What we don't need is 400 000 non-English speaking immigrants that will probably never add anything to the economy but will instead be a constant drain on the economy. The Libs claim the immigration is economically based.  But this is simply not true. I have 2 UK immigrants working for me but would go broke if i hired some of the immigrants coming into Canada. It is not personal.  It is just reality. I don't think most of the Syrians even want to be here.,0
1988,Parents need to write a letter to the top head of the California Board of Education and the local police department to see if criminal charges are warranted. If no can do  write to their State legislature and maybe the State Senators and Representatives. Try FBI. If no results  go for a tort lawyer. Gonna be a long hunt for one. They never tell you why they won't take your case. Really baffling. Be prepared to be disappointed. Civil rights are only for the rich and government employees on Capitol Hill. We are just foolish suckers who believe they represent the laws.,1
1989,First off  you'll always have Redskins.  Secondly  I'm not convinced that using Native American names for sports teams is keeping alive the inherent value of Native Americans. There are more effective ways to do that.  Thirdly  'erasing Native American names' will require renaming thousands of cities  towns  counties  rivers  mountains and about 26 states. Not likely.,0
1990,ELIs Coming!,0
1991,"The Affordable Care Act required members of Congress  along with their staff  to buy health-care insurance through the online markets created under the law  the signature legislative achievement of the Obama presidency. But the lawmakers and their staff members generally make too much to qualify for subsidies under the law meant for low-income Americans. So President Barack Obama decided to let individual congressional offices be counted as small businesses  thereby allowing members and their staff to qualify for the subsidies."  I'm not surprised that you missed this. There are no pictures.,0
1992,Haven't heard much from the pro railers lately; even they're having second thoughts about the project.,0

1998,It's funny to read these ignorant comments about immigration and the plight of Central Americans from myopic terrified xenophobes who've never gone further than a 2 mile radius from where they were born.,1

2010,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_the_press_in_the_United_States   - you want the government to feed you propaganda go to a non-democracy country.   don't get your news from one source get it from at least 3 different countries.,0
2011,It's a shame we can't hang worthless to society   cowardly  scumbags like they did in the old West.,1
2012,You cannot imagine how sincerely I wish you would try that. 15 seconds of infamy  a lifetime of the world seeing and knowing what an idiot you are. Make it happen.,1
2013,The CPP payments are increased by 0.7% for each month of deferring it after 65.  So if you deffer one year  the payments will increase by 12 X 0.7% = 8.4 %.  When you deferred one year  you lost 100% of one year payments.  You recover this money by receiving 8.4% more CPP in the following years   so you need 100%/8.4% = 12 years to break even.  So if you defer CPP until 70   you have to wait 12 X 5 = 60 years to break even  when you'll be 130 years old. The author was playing with numbers to prove his idea - was counting the money received after inflation  which makes the CPP increase for 5 deffering years 50% instead of 42%  and also the CPP payments continue to increase.  We are interested in the CPP purchasing power  not the amount of dollars received after indexing CPP to inflation.  The purchase power increases only by 42% for deferring it 5 years  and does not increase afterwards.,0
2014,Clinton molested women  obama traded 5 terrorists for a traitor and Trump sent a few tweets...WTF??? This hack who hasn't done anything meaningful in 40+ years needs to retire and leave politics to the men and women of this country who don't whine every time someone retaliates against the liberals threats and violence.,1
2015,Or is Donald Trump lying - multiple times a day? The answer is yes  to save you some research. He's the "only one that matters"  Trump himself says. Everything else is irrelevant.,0
2016,Trump is bad for the middle class.  He is a total liar and incompetent and needs to be impeached for breaking laws.  Republicans hate him but fear him as he is a violent  desperate man.  Sorry but Trump is terrible for Hawaii in all respects.,1
2017,Apparently ink is very expensive  otherwise why wouldn't the SA have the story title read "Deal would raise teachers’ pay nearly 14% over 4 years"?  This looks like an annual raise of 3.5% that includes cost of living adjustments.  This doesn't seem excessive in a world where some Hawaii companies can afford to pay board members more than $200 000 in compensation for a few hours of work a month.,0
2018,Hey Don. Don't want your cell # . Pass me Tiffanys- She's cute. Promise not to grab her by ................,0
2019,How about actually enforcing the laws on the books  or at least a congressional review of the efficacies of the agencies involved in enforcing them first? Adding another layer (law) and expecting that to have a desirable impact is a knee jerk reaction and wishful  magical thinking. Let's see if the current laws are being enforced. If they are that is one thing  if they are not that tells us something else.,0

2028,another ivan moore poll you got to be kidding. 670 pollsters aren't really a fair poll of over 770 thousand Alaskans. the legislators got us here with all the giveaways to the oil industry. without even addressing that problem  they just want to take our pfd   so they can go on with their own agenda and give our pfd to the oil industry so the oil industry gets a reprieve and we get the shaft  the people that own the resources. the legislators and gov should have gotten f minuses. what have the legislators brought us in the last 10 years  nothing but stackable credits. our pfd comes out in October and the election is in November  lets tell them what we think. to many oily legislators. the news paper on the kenai peninsula took a poll  and that poll said 82 % said to keep your hands off the pfd.,0

2043,Recent governments have put "social engineering" projects ahead of the economy at a time when technology and outsourcing is dramatically changing job opportunities and wage growth. To make matters worse many of the social projects have raised the cost of energy and taxes further lowering the standard of living of the average worker. So the rise of Populism should be not surprise. The people are telling politicians to get back to managing the economy. As the first Clinton learned  "Its the economy  stupid",1

2050,There were lots of reasons that the economy of the 60's was robust  strong unions  and a lack of competition for manufacturing jobs from less expensive overseas plants are certainly components. But  we also poured money into infrastructure programs (lots of construction jobs)  had a tax structure that didn't encourage the concentration of wealth (higher paying jobs)  and invested in education and research (allowing for more economic mobility and setting the stage for innovation and the modern economy). In my experience people who grew up then completely forget how much benefit they received  and like to pretend that they were just harder working  or that people today are just lazy. That is nonsense  it was in the late 70's when worker productivity and salary stopped paralleling each other. American workers today are incredibly productive  but salaries haven't kept up. That missing money was given to the wealthy elite because of republican tax and government policies.,0
2051,Here is one angle that is not mentioned in the article or by commenters.   You buy a house  pour all your money into paying it down.  Something happens  you lose your job  there is a big real estate crash  whatever.  You can't pay your mortgage and the value of your home is falling or has fallen.  (We don't all live in the GTA or the GVRD)  Upon bankruptcy  your home  car or most other assets can be siezed.  Except funds that have been in a RRSP for more than 12 months. Those are locked in and safe from creditors.   This may be worst case scenario  but diversifying your assets can protect you from events you cannot predict or may have no control over.   I vote to invest the money instead.  If you cannot afford the house with rising interest rates  you cannot afford the house.,0

2057,Question  the unemployed find other ways of making money  the uneducated do too.  Any neighborhood with gangs working the streets impacts every neighborhood eventually.  Gangs are a societal problem it's not just about parenting  or policing and Gangs cost us all money unless they can be helped to be more productive or taken off the streets.  Everyone has the right to feel safe in their neighborhoods snd the unsafe neighborhoods spill into other neighborhoods. Any neighborhood that has struggled with poverty  is not getting the same caliber of education as other neighborhoods or neighborhoods that have lost hope are prime neighborhoods for gangs.  So the disenfranchised in our society and our country need to be helped because they're victims and survivors in an unjust world. I think your comment is unclear and wrapped in a coded statement. What do you say?,0
2058,There has never been a civilization in human history that did not rely on taxation. You are a fraud. You avail yourself of all the benefits and prerogatives of living in a society but pretend you are self-made.

2060,I find I can trust my emotional facet more than you seem to or give others credit for. I'd say that  if a person is sensitive to the feelings of discomfort and pain after doing something wrong  he or she would also be sensitive to the feelings of joy after doing something right. How could a person tune down the signal of one and not the other? Why should a person do that? I think learning that doing good  either kindly or bravely  makes a person feel on top of the world is a part of learning to listen to one's conscience.,0
2061,Your political analysis is spot on as usual. Normally Im with you  but Stephen I think your being a bit of an a$$. These communities are small and these murders are hitting close to home. Are their lives more important than the other 1000's that got murdered over the year? No. However the psychological effects of having someone murdered in a community of 50 and a city of millions are worlds apart.   These people are scared. There is no safety  there is no security  there is no government to help  there is no police  no big brother to help in their plight  there is nothing. You know what happens when people are scared they try to find something  anything to hold on to.  Yes some idiots tried to foster support for their old misguided delusional pre-94 days  and most of the people protesting are not super hard core freedom fighters. They just want to be able to make a living and have a future in the country they call home.   This is sensitive.,1

2076,Again  even if Sanders supporters do a write-in campaign (and I would be stunned if Sanders were OK with that)  I don't think that it would have a noticeable effect of the number of votes Clinton gets in the general at all. But this is pure speculation on both our parts.  I've truly enjoyed this discussion by the way! Thank you.,0
2077,The Synod was not about the divorced and remarried receiving Communion  it was supposed to about the family. So you are quite content with the fact that for a divorced and remarried person in Krakow it is a mortal sin to receive Holy Communion whereas in Chicago it isn't? Synods are not meant to confirm settled doctrine not sow confusion by appearing to change it. If not every issue is to be decided by edict from Rome  which issues do and which don't? What if a Polish divorced person appeals to Rome because he has been refused Communion in Krakow? Is the Pope's answer  if he answers at all  going to be  tough or move to Chicago?,0

2087,I will share with everyone what I believe our biggest problems are and some possible solutions.  Part 1  I went through several rough periods after witnessing the abuse at Kaimuki Middle School.  My first rough period was caused by seeing the incident. The child's face when iced coffee was poured on him is scarred in my memory.  He looked up out of surprise and then realized what was happening.  He couldn't speak but his face expressed betrayal  as if to say  "How could you do this to me?" and then he proceeded to cry and flail.  Then there was reactions of laughter and statements supporting the EA's (Miss B's) actions by her coworkers (they all agreed he deserved it and never had any discipline).  I thought "How did it get so bad?"  I found out shortly after why the environment may be that way.  I informed the teacher (Leane) and she laughed.  I told her it was a serious issue.  I then informed an administrator (SSC) and she appeared concerned but stated the child had been bad lately.,0
2088,Jack Roderick's offers less than nothing to consider.  Alaskan's are facing the loss of their PFD check and state sales or income taxes.  At the same time Roderick is happy as can be that Walker hired a guy at 500 thousand a year to sucker investors into a project that doesn't pencil out . Meyers first goal is to hire more expensive guys to assist him in coming up with a shell game. It's funny to note how Roderick fails to address Giessel's other point of how if we get future customers to invest in the gas line   how their goal will be to get the cheapest rate on our gas as opposed to Alaska's goal of getting the most. Walker is obsessed with a gas line that doesn't pencil out and wants to put Alaskan's on the hook for billions in construction costs on the long shot the gas line will be built someday.  This project should be stopped and frozen and no more state money thrown down the rat hole .,0
2089,When Trump whines he is just lying through his teeth.  He  talks to the public as though he were hawking steaks on TV.  A deadbeat loser who stiffs vendors  and goes belly up many  times.

2094,One of the most abhorrent things coming from this guys “Christian” supporters is that the Bible supports sexual abuse of underage children by way of the example of the Virgin Mary and Joseph and therefore the word of God supports Moore.  This is a breaking of the 10 Commandments— according to Paul  the most important being the use of God’s name in vane which constitutes a profound disrespect of God. According to Paul  God’s punishment for those using God’s name in vane to minister for their own causes is to turn them into lusting persons including homosexuals that will face further punishment beyond that.,1

Awan  however  was kept on staff by Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz  D-Fla.  even though he was no longer allowed access to the House server network. * Authorities also have looked into IT workers putting sensitive House information on the “cloud” and potentially exposing it to outside sources. * Fox News is told that federal officials arrested Awan at Dulles airport in suburban Virginia as he was “trying to leave the country” ... http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/07/25/feds-arrest-it-staffer-for-wasserman-schultz-trying-to-leave-country.html,0

2106,I often heard this complaint when we lived in rural Waterloo concerning the Old Order Mennonites.  They don't mix  and live a separate lifestyle.  There is some animus against them within the community.  Not great  but some.   Diversity isn't a shopping menu.  If you accept diversity in general  you'll increase risk  and have to accept some bad with the good.  You can't say you're thankful for Italian food and not recognize that among a million people of Italian origin in our country  there is also an organized criminal element  for example.  You can mitigate the risk in terms of immigration policy  and police enforcement  for severe harms  but clothing and habits we dislike should not be policed.  I believe that left to time  the problem will solve itself  and that authoritarianism only makes matters worse.,0

2110,I am not sure the real estate bubble has a significant impact to the recent GDP growth. The pace of new home starts has been consistently good for the past few years as had the real estate industry's frenzied pace. If anything Vancouver and Toronto's have slowed a bit this past quarter due to new government rules.  I believe the growth as more to do with the oil patch turning a corner  low dollar  and some success in tech industries Canada is on a bit of a roll.  It is unclear if governments have any real impact on the economy other than setting a tone and trade policies.,0

2114,You can't be serious !   It was paid for by the state of Alaska .  Not one penny of ticket sales paid for it.  The UAA hockey used to be the only sport that paid it's own way   plus they took hockey money to help pay for all the other sports. The hockey program was thanked by excluding them from playing games at the new arena.  The number of fans attending is completely relevant.  If students don't support their own teams   there is no reason to have them.  UAA shouldn't be giving away free education to sports team players while demanding the rest of the students pay higher tuition .,0

2126,I'd agree  but belief systems still need to be exposed so we can test them and expose their flaws.  They need to be publicly discussed and publicly judged.  When we pretend it's not a belief system or that certain belief systems are protected by law  we are squelching freedom of speech and the public's ability to rightly judge between good and bad belief systems.,0

2136,Peter M Roddy  If  the legislature slashes Alaska's oil tax credits and runs oil producers out of Alaska 24/ 7  then TAPS will shut down.  Then Walker will take Alaska's Permanent fund away from the people to run his administration.  Government Gas Line Company will use up the PFD!  Solution; credits are needed until the Governor fixes his broken oil & gas system that is very bad!  DNR INCREASING THE BID COST BY 8 000% ON OIL LEASE RENTALS WHEN NO ONE BID ON MILLIONS OF ACRES AND HUNDREDS OF TRACTS  IN THE COOK INLET OR BEAUFORT SEA LEASE SALE IS ONE REASON THE STATE CAN'T SLASH THE CREDITS!  PROOF ON WHY THE STATE HAS TO HAVE THE CREDITS!  ALASKA'S 160 MILLION ACRES OF LANDS ARE SO MISSED MANAGED  THE DNR INCREASES LEASE SALE RENTAL TERMS UP TO 8 000% WHEN OIL PRICES DROP 70%  WHY?   ALASKA NEEDS THE CREDITS UNTIL THE STATE OIL & GAS AGENCIES MANAGES ITS LANDS SO THEY CAN ATTRACT OIL INVESTMENT  UNDER WALKER & PARNELL THE FAILED.  WHY SLASH ALL ALASKANS PERMANENT FUND CHECKS FOR EVER.,0
2137,We cannot afford our own fertility  so let's use immigration to import someone else's.  That will lead to outstanding social harmony  community completeness  and everyone being generally well-off. Who needs one's own  self-created family anyway?  I see no negative outcomes to this trend. Total societal harmony. If you cannot afford your own children  we'll import them. That's globalization.,0

2140,gotta keep in mind what TV can do to people - it is really hard to not play to a camera when a producer is hotly breathing down your neck.  I did listen to tom Hartman from Portland and ed Schultz on the radio.  at the time  they were the only alternative voice to all the right wing rhetoric.  Schultz was the rush Limbaugh of the democrats  only nicer. tom Hartman was great - he did get calls from both sides and really created an atmosphere for open discussion.  he  too   went national I think to air America as it started it up.,0

2143,The change in vote share might be somewhat interesting for numbers wonks  but the only by-election that has much meaning is the Markham-Thornhill one.  The two Calgary seats are all but guaranteed to vote Conservative while the Ottawa Vanier and Saint-Laurent ridings have voted Liberal for about a millennia.  I would expect the incumbent parties in those 4 seats will do somewhat worse since they are all swapping out high-profile candidates for much lower profile candidates  but I doubt they'll come anywhere close to going to a different party.  Markham-Thornhill though  that is a true "swing" riding.  It is smack dab in the middle of suburban Ontario and is the sort of bell-weather riding.  The party that does well in this kind of riding is likely the one that will win in a general election.,0

2148,Thanks Alan  but the cost of dam removal apparently didn't consider the downstream costs   so to speak. Of course if seismic activity sufficient to knock down those dams is considered then an earthquake sufficient to bring them down would likely knock out most bridges on the peninsula  which would threaten a lot more people than the possible collapse of those dams.   Look at what a huge amount of force was needed to bring them down by people. We could have just drawn them down by drilling through their base and letting the water escapeI know there were lots of reasons to take the dams down but it seems few people in authority thought about reasons to not take them down.  Given what we lost it does seem we could have kept the dams and provided access to the upper Elwha for fish. They were substantial reservoirs for time of drought  which we're now having to rebuild elsewhere.  Aside from that the fish aren't going to return until we do something about overfishing  both offshore and on.,0

2150,Left to our own devices  our population will be shrinking as we fail to reproduce in suffice quantities to even stay even. If you look at history (even contemporary history)  developed countries with shrinking populations tend to get poorer not richer. In the modern world  Russia  Ukraine  even Japan are good examples. There are several reasons for this  not the least of which is the increased cost of supporting an aging population.  And to address another point you make: urbanization  at least in Canada   actually leads to less impact on the environment  not more.,0

Chesterton   The American Republic will endure until the day Congress (State government also) discovers that it can bribe the public with the public's money.      Alexis de Tocqueville   “Liberals claim to want to give a hearing to other views  but then are shocked and offended to discover that there are other views.”         ― William F. Buckley Jr.  “The short memories of the American voters is what keeps our politicians in office.”        ― Will Rogers   Take your pick I think they all apply equally to what I read in the papers and comments from others!,0

2154,Not love lost either for Rajoy nor for Puigdemont  a media savvy-sexy journalist who knows how to exploit Franco´s paranoia  ( he died in 1976 please  give me a break)  supporting extremists teachers who brainwash  their teeny students to go out  supporting an illegal referendum  flagging posters accusing ¨Franquistas¨of persecuting Catalonians!  Hello: According to international standars such an illegal referendum was a shame of a farse that disowned the silent majority that don´t want to separate from Spain. That isn´t Franco´s ... ! That is common sense that  twice in the last weeks  went out in mass  in an fantastic outpouring of support for an inclusive - not an exclusive  chi chi fanatical  victimist - Catalonia. Those are facts to deal with  and - in the forthcoming elections to be held in December - 63% of the Catalonians at least  are going to vote for integration with Spain  not for an exclusive chi chi club of victimism that held an illegal referendum.,0

2201,He has the right last name. That's how it works off the road system,0
2202,Maybe your least intelligent comment yet  and that's a massively high (or low - depending on one's perspective) bar to clear. Summarily sentencing someone to go without the use of a toilet (there are plenty of them in booking) while being physically restrained and unable to stand/sit/lie down is not comparable to general booking in any way. In general booking  where one remains for 30 minutes to 3 or 4 hours  there is a big room with chairs  phones  TV's  and about 7 to 8 manned deputy stations  where deputies are tasked with amassing the intake information before inmates are assigned a cell. Essentially  other than being in a big room - there is nothing confining one's movements. Is there any way that your IQ is within 16 units/points of reaching triple digits? My guess  and it's a highly educated on at that  is that you are well below even that threshold.,0

If the Rail gets worse  he can simply say that he inherited a project that was already destined for failure and nothing could save it.  His friends at Bombardier (many after 37 years) will thank him.,0

2215,Hard to tell if Mr. Mayhan is replying to my post or not  but when he says "I hope you are not trying to blame the victims" - I have to affirm that I sure as heck am NOT blaming the victims. __I blame the driver entirely__ but also took the time point out that there are systemic issues that need to be addressed and the obstacles that pedestrians encounter and must be wary of.,0
2216,Ok you can gloss over what happened to her  BUT you cannot gloss over the fact that he grabbed another MP and dragged/pulled  him across the floor.  That is a huge no no in any work place.  Physically touching and I would say man handling.....but we are talking Justin Trudeau  maybe femininely handling a person is not acceptable.....there is no talking or spinning it into being ok.,0
2217,That's a very interesting point  Alf. I initially thought of it as a topic removed from the larger dramas of politics  an indication that people still have their petty worries no matter what. But of course you are right - we small fry are no better than those buying friendship on larger scale  if motivated by the same things. It's a pervasive thing.,0

2237,Truancy is a PARENT issue!  If there were consequences for parents the problem would certainly diminish.  However  this is just "Too harsh" in this state to demand compliance with almost any law or regulation.   Elsewhere there are fines and in extreme cases jail time consequences for repeated truancy.  It's just "Too harsh" for this state.    Just as it is "Too harsh" to really enforce mandatory license or insurance laws.  "Mandatory" in this state seems to mean "It would be nice!",0
2238,Where is our sense of proportion. So 300 people live in Gull  Bay and someone is expected  to fund a water treatment plant ?  This is a case of bad political correctness.  In the old days the first nation people were nomads and traveled from  here to there breaking up camp and moving on to regularly visited sites. There did not stay in the same place all year. so  their water was seldom or at least less polluted.  Commen sense would say these people move to an area where the per person costs would be affordable.  My goodness!,0

Oh wait...maybe not so much anymore...thanks to the Antifa and other hate mongers out there trying to stifle free speech...FOR ALL.  Perhaps we all should be praying for a calm to come over our country  RESPECT for each other  and rational ways to work out problems. Please don't show our country and the world your disrespect for our great FREE country that many fought and died for in its creation...and continue to do today to keep our country free.,0

2250,They make minimum wage and are paid overtime  just like American employees. The biggest difference is the cost to the employers  J-1's are not required to pay into Social Security or Medicare  which increases their take home pay by quite a bit. This also lowers the cost to employers who hire them.,0
2251,The GOP focus on the coal industry undermines (intended) that argument pretty thoroughly.  The market is shifting  and rather than saying "welp  good thing we're Republican voters and are thus smart enough to gain marketable skills!" the workers in that industry are shouting "Subsidize our work and punish our competitors so we can continue to earn wages unsupported by the market!",0

2255,Though I did not promote Trump  the idea of a lying criminal like Hillary  with the full support of the corrupt Democratic party made me sick to my stomach. Given the choices  HE was the BEST choice available.. I agree that Trump Bashing seems to be the current choice of the LEFT and those 'never trump' republicans that can't seem to get it out of their brains that this could actually be a good thing for us. We needed a REAL change after the failed policies of Obama. So far Trump is showing my wisdom and ability to grasp our problem(s) than Obama ever did.

2262,Yes  let the brain washed killers and their cheerleader here in Canada loose? you seem to fail to understand this is about control  money and arms sales for the US war machine.. which Canada unfortunately blindly follows like the sheeple we are.  When will the Canadian conservatives finally wake up and realize what is really going on? how they are brain washed into a cowardly state that makes them think it's ok to murder people around the world for some corporations profit???,1
2263,One of my favorite Reagan quotes is:   "Thomas Jefferson once said  "We should never judge a president by his age  only by his works." And ever since he told me that  I stopped worrying.",0
2264,This is getting silly: "White House aides said that Trump will have signed 32 executive orders by Friday  the most of any president in their first 100 days since World War II."  And yet: "The country wasn't based on executive orders " said Trump at a town hall in South Carolina in February 2016. "Right now  Obama goes around signing executive orders. He can't even get along with the Democrats  and he goes around signing all these executive orders. It's a basic disaster. You can't do it."  Face it  the guys accomplished NOTHING.  No matter how much spin you put on it.,0

2275,Graybeard  you are totally correct  and I apologize to you and Judge JAMES Hargreaves.   As a fellow graybeard I can only claim "another senior moment." Thanks to you  I went back   to the May 7   RG article and found it was actually TWO judges besides the illustrious Prof.  Mooney who who ridiculed these concerns   about Deady's racist history as just "Political Correctness:"   "There is a reason that the state of Oregon has one of the lowest black populations in the nation  and that stems from a legal history in which Deady actively participated " Cheney wrote in emailed replies to former Lane County Circuit Court judges Pierre Van Rysselberghe and Jim Hargreaves. The judges in emails had told the committee the UO shouldn't rewrite history to meet modern standards of Political Correctness.",0

2280,I wonder when Trumpnips will get their heads out of their collective asses and understand that immigration is not the most important promise that Trumpkie made . He also promised you he wouldnt cut medicaid or food stamps and he wouldnt take away your medical coverage among other things but your too busy licking his ass to see that hes not doing anything other than immigration attacks and hes doing things he promised he wouldn't to his base   YOU ! Your going to be a lot poorer than you are   hungrier than you are if Trumps budget goes through . Oh   I forgot   that is all fake news even when Trump's people say it live on TV,1
2281,The confusion is this is not stock options which Charles Djou has cleverly mislabeled them as. Caldwell has an option to purchase stocks at some later date. He does not own those shares and may never exercise his option to purchase those additional shares. This is comparable to Djou wanting Caldwell to report the value of a home Mayor Caldwell may or may not purchase 20 years from now as assets today.,0
2282,"Something's not working as it should." That something is our tax dollars. As if going to a friggin football game will be a life-enhancing event. In real life  people work hard to earn money for outings. A sporting event is costly  not on everyone's list of affordability. This fiasco brought to light a very broken system  although I'm confident that the paid chaperones enjoyed the day. Well  up to a point anyway.,0

2289,Some in the GOP have created the foundation that little d used...and we need to see what has recovered when he pulled back the rock  and watched them scurry. So no he is nothing new...race-baiting  homophobia  voter suppression  are all part and parcel with some conservatives...not all for sure but for way too many. Because winning for a Paul Ryan is the only thing that matters. Blocking effective governance is all that matters. Not doing the job you are paid to do is the Senate under the GOP. My god they have not scheduled a vote for the first time EVER on nominee for the Supreme Court. How stupid do they think we are? Based on little d and others  pretty stupid!,1

2291,Actually "Doc" over 135 000 000 people voted in the last US election. Claiming that Breitbart somehow gives voice to half that number is spurious logic based on binary right/left thinking and gross generalizations.,0

2293,Look at the usual "hotelier" talking head suspects (washed up politicians) and you KNOW they are full of CRAP. Add to that the part-time mayor's penchant for using "hoteliers" to support himself (Maxie the clueless police commission head  for one) and you just KNOW there's filth under the surface.  Crapwell's arrogance and hubris have now been aired (more) publicly and the People of HNL need to REALIZE he needs TO GO. After this term is up (or before  wishfully) he needs to retire to his tax exempt "historical" home and never hold public office again. As a matter of fact  I can almost safely bet he'll end up with some overpaid tourist industry or "hotelier" job as a form of payback for his years of kow-towing.,0

2295,All of you white folk #trump supporters have the audacity to make comments and judge and you don't have your facts straight.

Take off your WHITE hoods  reveal yourselves  know the facts before spewing your ignorance and feces about the internet. Don't you have a rally to attend?  #trump #kkk or something????  Shall we meet for coffee and chit chat?  Let's go.......I'm in!!!!!,1
2296,Another idiotic defense of the indefensible by the the revisionist "historian" bought and paid by the Alt-Right aptly named "non-Think Tank" propaganda machine to fill the national media with blatantly false Republican CONservative Fascist ideological bilge.

2300,Doyle = Liberal Troll.  You want me to answer his points?  Firstly   most of his points are ridiculous.  Second  what he chastises Scheer for is the exact same things he lauds Trudeau for (ie. sunny ways).  Third  he says Scheer has no policies but then later goes on to list Scheer's policies (albeit  just the one's Doyle disagrees with and finds offensive).  This isn't journalism - it's partisan opinion...... and a poor one at that.,1
2301,Some people take notes  or write notes  in places other than at their desks. An interesting thing about my 1970 typing class is that the guy with the highest IQ in the school barely passed (minimum qualification was two timed writings of 33 wpm or more). Manual dexterity is NOT linked to intelligence.,0
2302,I was reading the notes below and wanted to comment. I am the owner of the Visiting Angels in question and wanted to clarify some of the concern below.  JadedJade - I can assure you we care about our clients. I personally worked over 8 hours reviewing video and condensing it to a usable format to submit to the police. We worked diligently to get the family to agree to the video and to take action. We are so thankful they did so we can stop this type of behavior.  Listening2grasshopers - We are equally frustrated that she had previous incidents. Unfortunately  no one filed charges and APS does not report publicly unless criminal action was taken. We had no way to know and it was not reflected on the back ground check. This is why we worked so hard to get the evidence to put a stop to this. Looker - Just like society  there are Caregivers that come from all walks of life. All social backgrounds. My experience is that Caregivers as a whole are some of the kindest most warm hearted people.,0
2303,Little Potato is such a moron. Not only is he SNUBBING THE PRESIDENT OF THE US but the twerp is leaving Ottawa AGAIN in order to swan about taking selfies. Must be nice having a job with a reasonable salary and a life-long pension where you don't actually have to work. Aaarrrrggghhhh!,1
2304,What you didn't know is the Association can take out the loan to do the sprinkler upgrade  using the building as collateral. A 10 year loan will work.  Next the Association can spread the cost through an increase in the monthly maintenance fees  large enough to pay off the loan  small enough so the owner can handle it.  Association can also give each owner the option to pay "Their Fair Share" of the loan up front  minus the 10 years of interest.  Either way lets get'r done.,0
2305,So ridiculous.....I was a bit surprised at this fool's fantasy  even from you  Tri.  "...the Vatican City State has technically invaded it."  I hope you have your polished armor on and you are at the ready to battle the invading hoards of the Vatican City State!,1

2307,Really? Execs made  a judgement mistake  called on it  were ousted  new stellar crew brought onboard and now are rebuilding an important supplier of a valued service. Quit the badmouthing and get a life.,0
2308,Although vehicles speeding and passing at dangerous times contribute to most of these accidents  if the police enforced the law requiring vehicles to pull over when there is a delay of 5 or more vehicles  there would be far less serious accidents and fatalities.  I drive this stretch of road often  and have been stuck behind sight seeing drivers with as many as 15 or 20 vehicles behind them as an officer sits parked on the side of the road looking for someone speeding  but do nothing. This is not an excuse to attempt passing whenever they see a slim window  but the cop on the side who condones the traffic pile-up is also culpable.,0

2313,I know this because  in many instances  those who preach 'pro-life' also lobby (you could look it up) for taking contraceptives off the list of insurance-paid medications.  In fact  I know personally quite a number who are anti-abortion and anti-contraception.  I did not say 'all'  I said many  and that is the truth  especially where the objection is faith-based.,0
2314,Believe it or not  I hold no party allegiance and always vote for candidates based on issues regardless of party.  Republicans may be callous and greedy  but democrats are downright dangerous with positions that combine Republican greed for personal advancement with inability to see any reality except that which pleases them.  The latter tendency can destroy this country.,0
2315,There are NO ghosts.  People that WANT to see ghosts   claim to see ghosts.   People that WANT to see SASQUATCH  claim to see SASQUATCH.  Homer Simpson would tell you  Well  that's just plain  "STUPID".  Dohhhhhhhh.................................,1
2316,Trump will be President. Too late to wring your hands.  Horse has left the barn. It's to late to put the Genie back into the bottle. You media  political insiders and power elite should have done something different decades ago. Media ruled and manipulated the news and never the truth. You helped created the anger at Washington insiders. The masses are angry and boiling and none of  you in media or political  power didn't see  want to see or care as long as your small  world was secure.  The rest of America was ignored until Trump zeroed in and took your control away. Now America has shifted to  who knows what. Media mouths and political powerful elite idiots kept adding fuel and stirring the simmering pot. It has boiled over now and  many will get burned before it's over. Look to your face in the mirror. You created your own hell.,1

2325,Trump's support is collapsing as more and more people figure out that is a liar and a fraud  and has been his entire life.  His administration is a failed  hot mess that has more and more lawsuits filed against it every day.  Trump is a worthless piece of garbage  who has created a neck deep cesspool of conflicts.  The sooner he's out of office  the better.,1
2326,When you elect a lawyer who spent most of his adult life making war against the producers  he is going to make war against the producers.  When the guy who purchased Walker's business making war against the producers  that is what he is going to do also.  That's all well and good and gives the democrats  unions  Backbone and Alaska Firsters warm fuzzies  but does absolutely nothing to get more oil in TAPS.  And our state budget is about getting more oil in TAPS  which interestingly enough is precisely what SB21 was successful in doing.  The problem they have is there is a worldwide glut of oil on the market.  Screw around with the producers long enough and badly enough (tax credits  anyone?) and they will take their investment money elsewhere  which is what Brena and Walker are encouraging them to do.  And when they leave the state what do you do then?  Spend the Permanent Fund?  It'll be gone in 5 years.  What then?  Cheers -,0

2329,These illegals  new term 'undocumented'  stay because of all the free handouts.  If they were to become 'legal' US Citizens then they will have to work  pay taxes  etc. like the rest of us.  To bad the media can't call it like it is  but then the greater majority of them are run by liberals.  Fake news.......lol!,0
2330,"A spokeswoman for the Department of Taxation said the state expects to collect an extra $51 million in 2018 from the tax increase on high-income residents but will forgo $16.7 million because of the new earned income tax credit."  Understood that the existing food credits will continue  but my question still remains whether any credits will be available for those without earned income that are above the low level?,0

2335,If I look at the beginnings of jobs being off-shored; I'd be looking at the efforts of the GOP.  George H.W. Bush was in charge of spearheading NAFTA.  People like to blame Clinton  but it was instigated back in 1990 when Bush Senior was in the White House.  That being said  knowing the party and the political heritage of out sourcing labor (and downright hostile to labor  let's face it) - your inclination to promote the party mindset that helped your job go cyber  is quizzical. Sure you're mad  but do you know at whom you should be mad at or you've got a traditional scapegoat despite data to the contrary?,0

2339,the comments of a story are a rough place - it's just the way it is. i wouldn't read them.     your screen name and comment put a bit of a context to this.  you seem to be friend or family...?  all parties involved were friends from the sound of it. and that is a very sad situation. one friend accidentally kills a good friend. i can't imagine what that would feel like.     why was montez so fast to pick up a gun?  there were several people camping together  why would seeing someone moving about startle him?,0

2356,what a load of liberal bullshit. The overwhelming majority of Alaskans I speak with  all say the same thing. STOP SPENDING. Democrats and their public union cronies are the only ones constantly calling for MORE SPENDING. How many conservatives write articles for this lousy publication?,1
2357,He led the opposition to the Socialist Spanish government over abortion and same-sex marriage.,0
2358,Viola Desmond was unquestionably a woman of courage and deserving of significant recognition.  But replacing Sir John A Macdonald  who united four colonies to create the Dominion of Canada  and built the CPR to make a nation that goes from sea to sea with her is too much.

2370,Gun Society.  Officially America and more defined is Alaska as a gun society therefore any and all businesses  even private homes should have security cameras high and low  parking lots; additionally creating defensive spaces  for employees and customers   I often stopped by Carr's early in morning headed for work.  The easy access to store and unprotected parking lots often worry me  bad guys  bears  moose can all wreck havoc around Carr's  so safety is always on ones mind.  Putting up cement filled high posts by doors helps keep wild ones out of stores  wide allows shopping carts in and out  also handicap widths.  Cameras everywhere covering all areas.  Armed and Trained Security guards (off duty Police  Military  Fire Department) can be hired to insure protection for all especially during late night and early school hours.  The schools are breeding grounds for gangs  bullies  and thugs and it's getting worse as school monies dry up.,0
2371,This is true too. But having to prove one is canadian on a land title Is a start. Further to your point I would slap a 20% witholding tax on ALL foreign wealth / capital that crosses into canada regardless of whether foreigner or national or corporation. To absolve oneself of said tax one would have to register with cra and demonstrate that one has paid ta equivalent to that in csnada on said foreign wealth!!,0

2380,Oh  look another journalist doing a bit of navel-gazing. For those who think some guy who just makes stuff up and then types it on the internet can replace real newspapers  I suggest reading All the President's Men.  It shows how news is gathered-get at least two sources to confirm your story.  Or  if you are too lazy to read  I suggest the film Spotlight  which is about how the Boston Globe broke the story about creepy priests.,0

No way - hooefully mrchand gets his - he is and always be a dick.These days  you have to be a good team to make the playoffs - leafs are proving to be a good team,1
2383,It seems like his (Barry Bley's) point was just to clarify that Donald Trump is absolutely clueless in the world of politics. Trump is a fool and has made our country look foolish also because he handles diplomatic relations by name calling and tweeting. Can Trump be any more childish???,1
2384,Gone it's because congress knows that the idiot hasn't got a clue as to what the he👿👿 is going on around him. They figure that if they leave him alone to play with his blocks they'll be able to do whatever they want.

2391,More stupidity from the Trudeau government.  Shutting young Canadian families out from the housing market isn't going to solve any issues in the real estate market - these buyers are not the problem.  Offshore buyers who often pay cash are driving the prices up  not Mom  Dad  Buddy and Sis trying to move into their own home.  The only thing this will do is leave more selection for the offshore buyers.,1
2392,This is what happens when you don't teach economics or financial literacy in schools.  People who think it's fine to take out payday loans think it is fine for their government to run up deficits.  Hey  it's free money right!,0
2393,Sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere reflects sun light and thus helps cool the planet.  So yes more sulfur dioxide  if that is the pollution you refer to  cools the planet.  Its just science  not rhetoric.,0
2394,Your face is red with blood.,0
2395,Much clapping of hands for Justin Smoak  who by all accounts is having a half season to die for.  Pat Tabler keeps making the point that these gaudy #s Smoak is putting up are somehow tied to the fact he's getting regular playing time  which is of course  utter and compete tripe  it is not anything of the sort  and Tabler  who knows better  should not be telling porkies.  It is highly probable that this is not the new norm  just a good run.  It may last most or all of this season  perhaps a career year.  But when midnight strikes  whenever that is  Cinderella and the pumpkin  resurrection.  So  what's become of all those posters who went ballistic over losing Encarnacion?,0

2402,Dear God.  I've been listening to the same "long-term fiscal plan" mantra since I moved to the state more than 30 years ago.  It's never happened  and it ain't ever gonna happen. Why?  Because Alaska's a corrupt petro-state.  Since the 1960s it's always gone with the easy money  and that's given it opportunistic  mendacious  and frequently idiotic  politicians.   These aren't people who solve public problems  they're gambling addicts playing with other people's money.  They literally don't know how to conceive of the common good.  Soon  the money will be gone  and then we'll be a broke  corrupt petro-state.  So it goes.,0
2403,During the campaign 45 promised his replacement for the ACA would cover more people  provide better coverages  and cost less.  The fools who believed him are now going to find out they have been taken to the cleaners.,1
2404,Public pension promises can and will be broken . . public servants get paid amply by way of salary  no one will shed a tear if all US public sector employee contributions are refunded dollar-for-dollar rather than paid-out in the form of inflated retirement annuities . . the employee contribution portion is quite small  not in the trillions.,0

2407,That attitude ? Now why am I not surprised?,0
2408,If history repeats itself  then we can expect the Republicans in Congress to vote against any healthcare for our nation.  Back in 1964  the Democrats held a super majority in both houses and passed Medicaid/Medicare.  Nearly half of the 140 Republicans voted against Medicare.  If Republicans didn't support Medicare back in the early sixties  what makes people believe that they'll pass any national healthcare plan? Nada.,0

2413,Apparently the mealy mouthed Trudeau is not looking for a job at NATO.   If he was  he'd throw money at NATO like it was the UN.,0
2414,The European model is not "privatization" - it is adding a private component to a universal access government component  so that all those unemployed doctors and nurses  unable to work because of lack of funding  can get to work on those patients waiting for care.,0
2415,Rubbish comment.,1
2416,No Doc  the real story here is Buicks are selling like hotcakes in probably the largest  fastest growing auto markets in the world  and the brand has had a revival in North America since the late 2000's.  I'm not sure why those facts bother you so much.,0
2417,What a cluster#%#%. Meanwhile while we dither the USA continues to develop their markets and make sure ours goes nowhere other than to them. That should get us a fair price. How stupid can we be. Guess we will live on high real estate prices and dreams.,1

2422,He was referencing the title of Jim Wallis' book "Racism:  America's Original Sin".  Lots of adult CE classes have studied this book during the couple of years since its release.    The UCC is generally on the progressive side of the spectrum of Protestant denominations  but of all those denominations the UCC has the most church-to-church variability -- they're really a "herd of cats".  And congregations call and release their pastors essentially at will.  So I'm not surprised by this  nor that it happened in NC  but Lee will land on his feet.  A high IQ is said to signify intelligence  but wisdom isn't automatically conferred along with it.  That's the easiest way to explain why ostensibly "smart" people can perpetrate racist words and actions.,0

2426,The trash from alec should not be allowed anywhere in this state - there is no need for their far right wing blather. The slow-witted fool in the picture above and his mal-administration took alec policies  verbatim  to be introduced as 'original' legislation but they weren't bright enough to take out the alec markers throughout the documents. If outside legislation is introduced in CO  the first point of discussion should be: was this written by alec? If so  toss it all out and start over without their help. This outfit is legislation for the intellectually lazy and stupid.,1

2430,This is not CNN.  It's the Washington Examiner.  However  all news organizations should put Trump  his family  and his administration under the microscope for the Russian allegations.  This is one of their main functions.,0
2431,That is absolute bull crap. You poke the bear for decades  backing them into a corner  and they will respond. NATO and the West have been building military bases and missile "defense" systems for decades and if you look on a map  you see how strategic this build up has been - they surround Russia entirely. It would be crazy to think they would go down without defending themselves (in their own country  or in this case  through an ally).,1

2440,This will be an issue at the next election regardless of what Khadr does or refrains from doing because the public already knows that Trudeau is a spendthrift. The voluntary out-of-court payout of over $10 million to a person who committed treason will be seen in that context. Moreover  the simplicity of the issue will challenge nobody's memory  which will make it easy to re-kindle the original emotional response when voters are reminded years later.,0
2441,This is intentional provocation. If Chinese ships sailed close to the United States  the US would be hitting the panic buttons and threatening military action. They want a war with China.,0
2442,The topic is pertaining to doctors whom are small corporation owners as independent business operators. What entity do you propose small business people in Canada to embrace? The CRA allows corporations to distribute income through dividends. It allows them to hold cash to ride out lows in the market and invest in infrastructure. If you have any investments that you plan to retire on  you are likely getting dividends. Should that practice stop? Do you want the companies you invest in be restricted from building up cash  because if this happened most of those companies would not be generating any money for you  and they would likely be leaving their staff high and dry in retirement  by not being able to maintain pension solvency. Do you want to be incorporated  if so get ready for about $5 000/yr in basic legal/ accounting fees  which comes off the top of your income.,0

2448,And to hell with the rest of the world.,1
2449,That's funny.  I'm pretty much a straight ticket Democratic voter yet started working when I was 14 over 25 years ago and have never taken from the cookie jar.  How do you explain that?  Maybe you're the one who's bought into the biased you've been feed all the years.,0

2460,Trump  as insane as he is  is simply a puppet of Steve Bannon who once called Trump "a useful tool" for furthering his extremist agenda.  Fortunately  at least until Trump gets his Supreme Court pick  there is still one institution of government that can retain some sanity in America. The House and Senate with Republican majorities are bought and paid for  so don't expect them to reign in Bannon.,1

2466,Only 26 votes for Clinton in Glennallen. That's kind of surprising in a way. I figured it would be for Trump  but sheesh  only 26?  That does not encompass Copper Center  Kenny Lake  Chisto'   etc  though. It's a fun map  by the way. The ADN should do these things more often.  Have a good day  everybody.,0

2468,We had the CPC  alias the B.C. Liberals  in power in B.C. for the last sixteen years and they created  this mess. Without a genuine economic plan the B.C.Liberals/CPC relied on the property transfer tax to balance their budgets. Plain and simple  the Liberals and Conservatives in B.C. are to blame for the housing affordability crisis that we face in B.C.  not just Vancouver.,0

2470,The thing about opinion piece writers that make a living by selling their thoughts is  they very seldom ADMIT when they are wrong.   If one is being racist  sexist  or otherwise chooses wrongly  by way of engaging in racial or sexual discrimination in hiring or promotion against somebody  one doesn't have "the right to be wrong".,0
2471,Like you  for example?,0
2472,Wow  what a bitch. Someone invites you to enjoy a weekend with them in a beautiful place...for free  apparently. And you act out your inferiority complex by refusing to join in activities with other guests  complaining about the accommodation  and making offensive assumptions about your friends  their guests  and their parents. Hopefully your pals will wise up and realize that you're so much happier in the city and leave you there the next time they go to their home away from home. Oh and by the way  did they INVITE your dogs?,1
2473,Why?  What law was broken?  When officials (including secretaries) leave the State Dept  they are asked to turn in official communications.  If personal emails are among the official  the person is asked to personally separate them.  That's simply the way they did it.  When Clinton culled her private emails from the official ones  she didn't do it on her own.  She had a small team review the emails.  Also  the private emails were destroyed by accident by the company she had hired.  She did what she was told to do.  So again  what law did she break?  In addition  she was investigated by the FBI and cleared.,0

2475,https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/07pdf/07-290.pdf DC v. Heller does not look like an "anomaly" to me. Can you explain that? Also  the early states didn't always address the right to bear arms--at least not right away. It appears to me that it was a reality of colonial life that citizens would own guns  so the right of self-defense was thought of along the lines of natural law and common sense  with laws being silent therefor. https://www.americanbar.org/publications/insights_on_law_andsociety/14/fall-2013/natural-rights--common-law--and-the-english-right-of-self-defens.html  Regardless of where the debate goes  your assertion that the "Well regulated" part somehow trumps the "right to bear" part has neither legal  nor historical standing. You are using a modern definition and connotation of "militia" which is anachronistic at best  and purposefully deceptive at worst.,0

2479,I'm a supporter of the marijuana industry.  However  I've seen what's happening in Washington state courts since they legalized marijuana.  It's not driving issues that are leading to law suits; it's workplace issues.  Most workplaces continue to have policies forbiding their workers from partaking.  When workers test positive  they lose their jobs.  But the test for THC is so inaccurate (it can't determine when the THC entered the blood system)  lawyers and unions are ripping it apart.,0

2482,The legislative session is a season unto itself; just like the tourist season and the off season. The basis for my numbers comes from personal experience which didn't include local sales taxes and gratuities. Your focus should be on Kenney's time while serving on the school board. Which was a lot of spending  rising property taxes and shamefully dismal graduation rates.,0
2483,No  in fact it isn't a crime like any other. It's a crime that often brings enormous feelings of shame and crippling self doubt to the victim. (unlike burglary)  It also often happens in circumstances of major power imbalance between victim and assaulter - all factors leading victims not to complain to police right away.  This is so well understood that I don't believe there is any chance at all that any Canadian federal government will make this the one indictable crime with a strict narrow time limit.,0

2530,I moved to Alaska in 1972.  In 1972  Alaska state government revenue was $365 million and expenditures were $372 million.  In 1969 those numbers were $198 million in revenue and $212 million in expenditures so between 1969 and 1972 oil money was already making a big difference in both revenue and expenditures.    Adjusting for inflation  $365 million in 1972 dollars is equal to $2 127 million in 2016 dollars - a bit over $2 billion dollars.  However  according to the article  the State of Alaska is now spending $5.5 billion or about 2.5 times as much as it did in 1972 but it is receiving less revenue than it did in 1972.    The Permanent Fund is unique in American government.  If you dip into it now  instead of reducing the size of government back to about $2 billion  when will you stop?,0

2534,The Times article balances the issues but leaves out critical facts. A 35 foot vegetation buffer along the Waiopili that now collects all flow from Omidyar's site will not stop the manure that would drain into an extensive ditch network running through the Omidyar pastures  emptying into the Waiopili as it flows to the ocean. There is no mention of the USDA NRCS study that found 80% of Omidyar's acreage primarily clay soil. They concluded the site is at high or very high risk for runoff. Also missing is Omidyar's withdrawl of his Final EIS after the Director of the Office of Environmental Quality Control (OEQC) recommended against DOH approval. Why is Omidyar willing to risk the health of such a beautiful environment when he has to import his herd's feed and export the milk to another island for processing and packaging? If nothing else  the Times article unfortunately confirms Omidyar's intent to proceed despite abundant evidence of serious harm that out weighs any benefit.,0

Then sales prices is of a pair of recent sales  which seldom happen here. No wonder I find the resulting house numbers out to lunch  it's HOUSING.    An interesting way to evaluate ALL  "accommodation"  prices   but definitely not a useful way to evaluate individual HOUSE values. OK numbers for insider analysis  but not useful for us public  wondering what our house is worth.,0

Of course this thing has been perfectly ideological; it was always a perverse attack upon long-overdue progress for America and humanity by their true sworn enemies.,0
2540,So 30 pct speculators (investors)  5 pct ( let's say 10 pct ) foreign buyers. 65 pct regular buyers.

2546,He's a walking cliche of everything that is stupid about liberals. Why? Because it's the current year  of course.

2551,I'm usually Ivo's harshest critic - but on this one  he is indeed correct.  Now it's entirely possible that you had a real illness  and that this illness was due to an environmental cause - but you're wrong about what that cause was. Of course failing to abide by the law is a serious accusation - and should be investigated as corruption  but this particular one cannot in any way cause your body harm. There are many other environmental causes that are hard to spot and more likely. Air pollution from fossil fuels kill 7 million people every year. Perhaps your old neighbourhood just had too many cars. Mould infestations  often neighbourhood wide  can release toxins causing symptoms like you describe-  and very hard to diagnose since doctors don't usually test for poisoning unless there is a mentioned reason to consider it. That's just 2 examples.  You say yourself you didn't consider environmental causes until you moved away and symptoms dissapear. How would a doctor have done so ?,0

2555,You're correct. But the article inferred he was in jail prior to going to the hospital.   Either way  inadequate medical care in custody and/or a lurking and impatient police presence pressuring medical staff  in the hospital  waiting to arrest a patient  is dangerous and needs to stop.,0
2556,You have no credibility  fly boy.   There's no hidden message in this.  I'm not allowed to hire people who work for me and not somebody with an agenda.

2557,Trump stepped away from his own rhetoric and appears to have embraced the Saudi world view - Just as Iran has ELECTED their moderate for another term.  The billions US is getting in arms sales and the reputed $100 million to Ivanka for her foundation might be helping set the childish Trump's world view.  And when he gets to Israel the hate and blame Iran will just be reinforced.  But hey - Trump got to play with a sword and was given a really gaudy necklace so - winning.  Sad!,0

2560,Your post is a copy and paste of a common lie on the internet.  Dr J. Anthony Morris who said that quote was apparently a bureaucrat at the FDA in the early 1970s  he was not 'the chief vaccine officer ' and was forced out during a political battle. He is not a “distinguished virologist”  and his only two publications indexed by PubMed are from the late 1940s-early 1950s and dealt with bacteria  not viruses.

2581,What is so "abysmally stupid" is your attempt to use a definition of a term created by gun control activists as though it were an accepted term and definition.  You realize  of course  that when the police shoot 2 or more criminals in an attempt to provide safety and security for the populace  or a homeowner shoots two or more invaders of their home  that the definition you are using for "mass shootings" has been satisfied  yes?  Intentional distortion of the facts to bolster a political argument is  indeed  an "abysmally stupid" tactic/,1
2582,Left vs Right  Liberal vs Conservative  Republican vs Democrat and Pro-gun vs Anti-gun. And the beat goes on! This is why nothing is accomplished in D.C. or our State Capitals. Divide and conquer and politics as usual. I'm not seeing specifics on how and what kind of new gun laws will prevent these senseless mass shootings. Neither side is offering suggestions  only criticism and argumentative talking points. We have amateur lawyers arguing the definition and meaning of the 2nd Amendment (on both sides). The "anti's" aren't willing to admit that this could be a societal issue and that more gun laws will have little or no effect. The "pro's" are not willing to admit that as responsible gun owners we must admit that some new restrictions and regulations are necessary and that at the very least stricter enforcement and compliance to existing laws is necessary. Time to stop letting emotions interfere with compromise and progress. Until then  I'm out of this discussion!,0

While I have my own ideas why this has happened (note that the student to faculty ratio has remained relatively constant  as have faculty salaries  for many decades)  it is a complex issue. We should at least give UA some faint praise here that their costs have not increased as fast as the regional average.,0

2591,Wow.....all these comments....looking to demonize this guy or turn him into a martyr.   Forget this guy. The mine is a ridiculous idea if you think that the integrity of the surrounding ecosystem is important. Maybe instead of trying to crucify this guy  you coule Google "porphyry copper deposit" and read for two minutes about the type of deposit it is that Pebble hopes to develop. If you can do a little math  and plug in the numbers that Pebble has stated they think they could recover in marketable minerals  you can get an idea of the amount of waste that would be generated. Toxic waste that would supposedly be stored "in perpituity". What a steaming pile of hubris.   Mining and fishing probably can coexist some places - not here. And anyone who sings that tune probably thinks that any mine  anywhere  is a good idea  and could honestly not care less about what happens to the surrounding environment.,0

2595,My family physician is a great guy. He bills our province $510 000 a year and works long hours. His private practice shares space with 4 other physicians. My brother in law is a pediatition and bills $350 000 a year and I’ve never seen him at supper on Friday’s before 7pm. My family physician raised 5 kids and his wife works part time as a family physician through that time. My brother in law says his overhead runs between 22 and 25%.  I don’t buy the 35% office overhead in BC. That doctor needs a better plan. There is a simple fix to the Doctor incorporation problem. Let the rules take effect and go back to the province and negotiate higher fees. Then pay taxes on the same footing as other people who can’t benefit from corporations. If you can’t negotiate higher pay  move to the USA and bill an HMO for your services and see how that works out. Doctors who have tried that are coming back in droves.

2605,Very well said!  3 other metrics are also be instructive.  One is how well greater public sector (GPS) workers fare against inflation compared with their market sector counterparts on both an annualized and a 10 year basis.  Over the past 10 years the new privileged class fared well above inflation while competitive market sector employees actually lost ground vs inflation.  A 2nd is what % of the provincial operating budget goes back to the GPS employees in pay  perks and pensions.  The last figure I saw was from 2011 or 2012 when then finance minister Dwight Duncan revealed it was 55% of the budget.    Thirdly   it would be useful to know by what % public sector employment increased from the prior year compared with population growth to gauge dismal GPS productivity.    These metrics will reveal how unaffordable and inequitable GPS compensation has become since McGuinty got elected in 2003 with his cynical dog whistle promise of "labour peace in Ontario" and the trend forward .,0

2607,The best way we can help is to continuously  question the idiots in Washington DC - their interests  their motives  their objectives   For if they hadn't armed the rebels in Syria - there would not be an unending war there  Had they not bombed Libya and removed Qaddafi from power the arms flowing from that country would have never reached the rebels in the middle east (including ISIL)    Had they not  invaded Iraq  over a decade ag while lying to the american public about WMD they might have the  world on their side  And had they  not continuously provoked Putin in his own backyard he might actual be working with them to find  a lasting solution  Without the idiots in Washington DC there would be no victims for the white helmets to rescue  Name ONE Muslim state that has attacked the United States of America. Name One.  Now count how many Muslims America has killed  assassinated  declared collateral damage  targeted   tortured  bombed  shelled  annihilated,1

2616,"How do conservative messages mask reality?" The "sound of a cymbal monkey in action" was my first thought. Wealthy conservatives buy media - TV stations. papers  radio stations  etc.  is mostly how its done. KMTR was started in 1982 by local investors (a relative was one) with the intent to broadcast their Ayn Rand version of content without any balance. Their mission failed as the license was passed around and one initial investor didn't turn out to be a sports caster after all.,0

2621,Sorry  MisterAL  but that is just ridiculous. Listen closely: Hillary was probably the worst candidate the Dems could have chosen  and I was a broken record with friends telling them she has truthiness issues  and an entitled person who assumed that it was her turn. That's why she lost. Bad choice  opportunity lost  White House lost etc etc. Got it? Having said all that  there is no way you can compare the frequency of lying or the the ease of lying  compared to Trump. No way  he is the champion of not telling the truth.   Here's some interesting Wikipedia info on 'pathological lying'  does any of this sound like our PEOTUS?  The stories told are usually dazzling or fantastical  but never breach the limits of plausibility..  The fabricative tendency is chronic; it is not provoked by the immediate situation..  ...the person might be presented as being fantastically brave  as knowing or being related to many famous people  or as having great power  position  or wealth.,1

2634,So Murkey will support tax cuts for the wealthy is exchange for ANWAR drilling?  More importantly how much will Alaska have to pay the oil companies to drill it?

If there is not a clear agreement as to how much tax per barrel Alaskan will receive   then leave it in the ground.,0

2638,As has already been pointed out  that information was from 2010 forecast. Actual CA debt is 443 billion which changes your numbers to $443B deficit / 36M citizens = $12 305 per citizen. Alaska $3B deficit / 700K citizens = $4 285 per citizen. Facts are really pesky things  aren't they Pat.,0

But it's on your mind. .  Words don't matter to me as much as deeds.

These Redoubters move into areas where no one else had any previous need to pack guns in daily life or shut out their neighbors.  Now they have to pack guns to protect themselves from these horrid invaders.  These clowns set up their own enclaves divorced from the native folk as reflected in the article.,1

2662,President-elect Trump lost the popular vote by 2 to 3 million plus people. No one can dispute the Electoral College outcome  but the popular vote results hardly present Mr. Trump or the Republican Congress a mandate. With the country apparently split politically almost down the middle  no side has a sustainable or viable mandate. A functional and healthy democracy will always require compromise and sensitivity/responsiveness from all sides. Power is a pendulum that will always swing back and forth. Good governance will always require respect for and responsiveness to all points of view. Arrogance associated with a mandate mentality will ultimately doom any party claiming to have a corner on the market of wisdom. No party  thankfully  can always have it "their" way.,0
2663,I fully support President Trump in this new Media Great Awakening. It is entertaining to watch liberal heads spin and discombobulate into near lunar orbit on a daily basis. So Mr. President keep the tweets. I crave Washington Political Theater in how it disturbs the Democrat Party and its ensconced institutional media roots.  And as to Senator Schumer... the MORE he runs to the cameras and rants and raves:  The happier I get.,0
2664,I don't pay a lot of attention to Julian Assange's tweets  Sure you piece of gorilla dung.....that's the reason your sister Hillary lost.  Just blame it on Russia.   Two more days until the nightmare leaves.,1
2665,I think it's become fashionable lately  since November really. A bunch of cowards on both sides of this crapheap.,1
2666,Schumer has already tipped the Demos hands  based on research polls which reflects your point of view  that they will NOT support Hillary & her loyal soldiers like Wasserman Schulz  Podesta & even alleged native American Elizabeth Warren who want them to go away to make way for new leaders like Kamala Harris & even Tulsi Gabbard.   Harris is a smart former prosecutor  camera ready & from a physical standpoint Harris looks hapa.  She has Caucasian features & definitely can stand toe to toe against bully Trump.   If Harris runs on a conservative democratic platform that is inclusive  such as NOT repeal Obamacare but make improvements to reduce waste  cost  premiums  yet still provide the safety net for those in need  I think she can win the electoral college. Trump has lost his base that HATED Hillary  however now that it is known he is in neck deep with the Russians is something they will NOT tolerate.  Fox fanatics still support Trump but not for long when Mueller gives a public report,0
2667,Was that part of your decision to be independent?   They are definitely a permanent part of Democrats history  mythical very much like the conservative Reagan.      Hmm  what I remember about both was the feeling of good will they both seemed to have.     I can only think of what either of them might say about this years election.  I'm old enough to not expect idols.   My own story is that I stood in the fairgrounds waiting for Bobby Kennedy to arrive for his primary against McCarthy.   I was in a narrow hall when he went by and shook my hand.    He was a small guy and it was just  a few seconds.   Wierd to have him die in similar circumstances just a few days later.     I remember how vulnerable he was moving through a crowd.  A memory that I recognize was a young person who touched somebody famous.    I also saw both Mc Carthy and Nixon at Mc Court.    And of course I remember being home and hearing of the JFK  assasination.     Sometimes icons give comfort  if not the bare truth.,0

Furthermore  you keep referring to the House as some "other" you are a member of that body if you have all the answers on how to balance the budget without taxes why have you not done that? How many years have we heard you say we don't need taxes we can do it without  yet here were are another year and you have failed epically.     Take note on this next part  if by not needing taxes you mean cutting our schools and our University further then count me out. Thousand of state employees have been laid off and our schools have been cut to the bone and yet you still sit there with the fantasy of no taxes needed. Sir  when is this trigger point when you say ok  its time? You know as well as I do that most Alaskans support a small tax to support OUR state  me as your constituent included,0

It's Wisconsin  Michigan  Pennsylvania  Ohio  Florida  North Carolina --- the 13 battleground states were drastically wrong by as much as 10%.  Here's what happened  Clinton beat Trump by about 3M in just LosAngeles and greater NewYork City.   If you take away NYC and Los Angeles  Trump still beats Clinton in the rest of the US.  Clinton won in most of the big cities.  Trump won most of the suburbs and small towns  he won in 2600 counties  Clinton won about 420.  But each city have bigger populations  the democrats from 2008 have been playing identity politics and working with demographics calculus to try to build their lasting political coalition base  and they rely more on the big cities.  This strategy failed here because those towns and suburbs rebelled against the cities.    Want to know with US is divided?  Ask your leaders and the MSM.,0

That said  reading great books   learning a second language  playing a musical instrument  doing mathematics.......all of these and more are a real boost to the grey matter and a durn good idea whether you fear mental decline or not.

As far as not taking the risk or effort to go into other lines of work  shall we hold everyone responsible for not taking the risk or effort to become a millionaire? I think you have bought the notion that if one just takes  the risk and effort one can become a millionaire. If you have not done so already  you should look up how wealth begets wealth. It is know as the Concentration of Wealth.The part about the "risk" means you accept that there is a certain luck to become a millionaire. Are people who are unlucky responsible for their fate and thus cannot complain about the high cost of medicine? I do believe that medical malpractice is too high. That is why I support limits on such judgements. But I think you are saying that I am upset about the cost of medicine due to my own failure. Correct?,0

2703,While fed and some state tax incentives for both have existed for more than 40 years in the US  I think it may be too late for these alone to do much good in anything other than a continued growth/full employment scenario.   In any other scenario  e.g. jobless growth and/or mostly low-wage job growth  not to mention various types of stagnation  decline  and collapse scenarios  profit sharing and employee stock ownership could not only be useless  but could also result in employees losing income (especially in the case of stock ownership).  However  had either become the norm  rather than the exception  in corporate American at least 30+ years ago  they may have reduced the increase in income inequality resulting from the combo of automation and outsourcing (job exportation to cheaper labor markets) over the same time period.   Such incentives MIGHT still be useful before automation runs its potential full course  but probably less so for the growing number of "gig" economy workers,0

2718,Exactly. IMO  Cannabis is Not Legal...Ohhh yeaaah...they "Legalized" it -but it really means they took control of it in order to tax it! That's when the politicians  smelled MONEY! To be truly "Legal" just drop all criminalization  and have ZERO Taxes. Anyone should be able to grow a plant or Ten  and not be taxed. THAT would be truly "Legal".

While AV is far from perfect  for this particular variant  the CSE says that  McAfee and Symantec are successfully blocking the threat.  (They haven't verified others).  The organizations that "don't have time or budget" are failing to do critical maintenance.  It's like not changing the oil in your car  or failing to maintain your furnace.  Saves a few bucks this month......but costs a lot more in the long run  and can lead to catastrophe.  It's only difficult if you fail to keep up.  If management won't spend the money  it is an IT professional's duty to educate them on the risks.,0

Republicans are stupid.,1
2739,This particular lot is Sound Transit  not Metro. But Sound Transit has a similar program and was prepared to include Mercer Island.

2752,South Africa's political-economic structure has remained unchanged since the late 19th century. The political elite and the economic elite act in each other's interests at the expense of the rest of the country. This fundamental structure didn't change in 1994. All that changed was the identity of the political elite. So SA does indeed need radical economic transformation  but not the kind that the ANC wants  because they are not going to restructure the economy in such a way that it cuts off the free flow of 'gravy' into  private bank accounts (which is the cause of the problems they claim to be solving),0

2765,``We appear to be living in an era where reality TV stars are now able to trade their popularity on TV for popular support.``   Well  you took your time reaching that conclusion  Deeply.  What do you mean  ``now``? The era marked by TV stars ``trading their popularity`` begin in 1967  when the former host of Death Valley Days and dramatic TV guest star (Lux Video Theatre; Dick Powell Show; Wagon Train  etc.) ran for Governor of California.  Half a century is a heck of a long era.   Cannot argue with your concluding statement  Deeply.  Although there`s nothing new there  either.  People have been attracted to ``a strong man figure`` for as long as those `figures`have been attracting a crowd  be it to the edge of a muddy field   a soapbox in the city square  the back of a train  inside an arena or--now--on-line  on the  phone people hold in their hands  just anywhere at all...,0
2766,Contraception is a sin for morons.,1
2767,You say the people of Lanai are under control of a billionaire from the mainland. What is the difference of being under control of a billion dollar corporation from the mainland and now? And subdued? As compared to what? I guess it is compared to the obstructionist resisters at mainland town hall meetings. Instead of subdued how about civil? I admit I am biased against most Democrats  but not in Tulsi's case. It seems she did not plant people in the crowd to ask questions to push her agenda. As she represents the Island it is good she goes there. The two senators also represent the island. Where are they? I guess not enough votes or money to earn a visit.  Tulsi's seems to speak what she believes is best for her constituents and the country. Hawaii's other three representatives in Congress speak off the piece of paper given to them by the DNC. So Lanai may be under control of a billionaire from the mainland but three of our Washington delegation is controlled by the mainland DNC.,0

On the Republican Women of Clallam County website  all three candidates are listed as Independent/GOP and the term keeps appearing in the PDN.  Donnie resorts to his usual mix of hyperbole and misdirection (I won't use the term deflection as GOP apologists seem to like the word so much) in an attempt to evade explaining what an "independent/ Republican" might actually look like. I will continue to use scare quotes to show that the GOP concept of independent is a lot different from how the rest of us use the term.,0

Instead of challenging a comment they hide behind anonymity and delete comments that they don't like or can't handle outside the confines of their safe space.  The ridiculous "Among abstracts expressing a position on AGW  97.1% endorsed the consensus position that humans are causing global warming" math calculation is based on a "32.6% endorsed AGW" subset.

The manner in which they did that earned my respect over most all the other overpaid professional teams/athletes I watch in Denver. To suggest that our respect for the Rockies hinges on a single game is like suggesting that our respect for Kiz hinges solely on his next commentary.  The Rox have been lousy years  but clearly are trending in the right direction.  That's something Kiz should also aspire to.,0

Furthermore  their desire to mislead the public regarding the moose calf situation and promote highly prejudicial hunter/trapper bias to the drivers of Denali this past spring during our training (both by the Chief of Science) is inexcusable.   Quite simply  before Denali NPS imposes any new increase in fees on the public  they need to justify those fees with specifics as to why they are needed. They also need to follow their own mandates of preservation and visitor enjoyment & incorporate transparency  openness  accountability  honesty  practicality & compassion towards wildlife in their decision making.,0

This is just what the "greedy corporations" want and are now prospering from on the stock market. Of course  when the average Joe sees his short term job from this evaporate in a cloud of pollution and safety infractions resulting is severe detriment to his health and welfare  he will then blame the so called  "elitist politicians" for failing to protect hm and continue to vote for the well funded right wing criminal trash ones.  The stupidity of the American right wing voter is limitless.,1
2812,Garry is absolutely right.  Stanley "If Tulasi Can Do It  So Can I" Chang's attempt to leapfrog to Washington  D.C. was downright embarrassing.  The reality is that Chang has about as much of a chance of going to D.C. as other failed Democrats like Ron "DUI" Menor  "Slick Willie" Espero  Donna "insert Mercado here" Kim and Muliufi Hannemann (both the 90's version and the more recent version).   Guys like Stanley Chang need to learn that they will never rise above their station in life  except to be local puppets for the Democrat Machine and the Rail Cartel right here in the islands.  Heck  Billy Kenoi has a better shot.  On the other hand  the bragging rights for Chang within the Democrat Party -- should he take down Slom -- would give him a few chips to cash in when Chang makes his next run . . . probably for Governor or President.  He's ambitious  but there's a long line ahead of him.,0

2815,after all this political THEATER AND SHIBAI GRANDSTANDING AND POSTURING  one way or another  this debacle WILL COST EVERYONE  for generations to come - IF IT IS NOT COMPLETELY STOPPED "IN ITS TRACKS".  the common argument that all the immense funding to date will all be wasted is not true.  sometimes the high cost of the education is worth learning that some "leaders" are just PLAIN STUPID - and must be replaced as soon as possible.  the other argument for building the rail  "to relieve freeway traffic congestion from the west side"  has been proven to be patently FALSE - on all levels.  the finite financial limits of our finite population has been reached!  now these "leaders" will go after the isle's Golden Goose - tourism.  AND TOURISTS ARE NOT AS DUMB AS THEY MIGHT BELIEVE!,1
2816,Exactly. Except for one thing: the current fire crisis indicates that humans may not "manage nature" but we certainly can disturb it.,0

2820,No other org. wields more power over our schools. Yet while nearly 1/2 of PPS students will drop-out/fail to graduate  this Union is likely to focus on 3 priorities: 1. De-link Teacher pay  benefits  job security from student results. 2. Amplify the continuous 'Chorus of Crisis" (in all public comments) to demand that average costs per student contin increase while days of required instruction decrease.  3. Expand Union influence into Community College Instruction Standards (lowering those) & Costs  (raising these).   I'd prefer an honest presentation of PPS Annual Budget devoid of its current hieroglyphics & showing the amount funding unions (a nice slice of PPS payroll) along with the number of days students spend under instruction.  Interviewed by the Portland Teachers Union (in '94  I ran for a seat on the Portland School Board)  I advocated increased days of instruction and suggested that Teachers could teach year round.  They looked astounded  as if I'd just $%*&  on their china.,0
2821,we are already not competitive in terms of production in the world. Now to add to that Canada thanks to Justin  we will be at even more of a disadvantage.

2823,How does Trump know were Obama was born? His birth certificate published by his white house handlers has the name of the 1961 hospital wrong. That hospital didn't exist until 1978 . So either it is a MATH problem (1961 vs 1978)or someone can't read. Or why would the hospital staff in 1961 put the wrong name on a birth certificate?  And trump was wrong about who started the "birther" question. It was Allen Keyes when he ran against Obama for the Jack Ryan Illinois Senate seat. He challenged Obama about being "natural born" and Obama replied during an debate "I'm not running for president". History is a troublesome thins and memories fade.,0
2824,The same applies to you too  except you so much as look at another women I'll kill you.,0
2825,That is a good point. Language does change and "begs the question" is assuming legitimacy from the increased use  replacing "raises the question". And it is certainly true that language has a way of separating groups  but not just the elite. Try hanging out with some street people in New York and see how well one can speak their language and be accepted. I also think using the term "begs" implies that a statement urges a question more than the term "raises a question." To me it moves the responsibility for asking the question from the person asking it to the cause being in the statement. In other words  it says the statement "begs" the question generated by the questioner.  But how can a statement beg a question? Maybe it doesn't.,0

2830,The public needs to stall for 3 years  get a slate behind Josh Colle and vote out every single person who supports the unneeded 6-km dig through bedrock  when air on the RT route to the very same destination has so much less resistance. Then we can build the subway line on teh RT route in 6 months with good planning and several teams.  I'd hate to lose Mayor Tory. We need every single stop of his Smartrack and can get them for precious little money if we use our heads (ie cancel the bedrock dig!)  and still have fast electrified trains that will gain time as they start and stop so much more quickly than diesel engines do now. But we cannot stomach the futile 6km bedrock dig when we can travel through air on the old RT route and use that $3B elsewhere  such as on Smartrack  the Relief line  etc.,0

Back to Webster?,1
2835,Those who see criminal antifa members as "authorities" needed to put white supremacists "in their place" don't seem to understand that the antifa criminals give the white supremacists "their place" in the pages of the MSM.  The legitimate "authorities " acting with the power of the state  have typically made very sane and rational decisions to allow white supremacists to exercise their right to free speech alone  in dark corners where no one notices them.  But for antifa idiots  that sad process would have gone on quietly until it died a lonely natural death.,1

2839,Lawrence G. Brown - I agree with you about voting all of them out  but ...  BUT ... if you just replace them with someone from one of the two major parties  you are just "doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results." The two-party system provides an ILLUSION of choice that is not real. Look at the records of the two parties and you will see they both result in the same mess  just with different rhetoric.  I urge everyone to vote 3rd party in every race from President down to the city council if it's partisan. Make a REAL change by choosing candidates who have not been co-opted by special interest groups and corporations and are not in bed with the political powerbrokers in Washington DC.  Alaska is a great place to start this peaceful revolution. We have an independent governor and we wrote in a senator (although I think we shouldn't have re-elected Lisa). We are electoral pioneers. Let's take the next step and throw the 2 major parties out on their ears.,0

The US once was the global leader precisely because of its interdependent system of alliances and it very real good faith interest in everyone's well-being  not just its own (indeed  its own belief that its own well-being required global allies).  But when Americans fought and died for these American principles  they had to do that for your benefit as well. Package deal  I guess.,0

2857,That's not what he said. What he said was that Natives don't tip  as a way to convince people his stupid summer job opening was attractive BECAUSE the pilot wouldn't have to fly Natives.,1

2859,Yes  your hypocrisy  bias  and dishonesty are repulsive.  You sound a lot like former poster Marty E.  You must be the same troll.,1
2860,Don Lemon and the rest of the clapping seals at CNN are the poster children for hypocrisy.  I mean  really?  Jeff Sessions opened a Federal Civil Rights case into the murder by a KKK member in Charlottesville.    For crying out loud  Sessions convicted and sentenced a KKK member to the death penalty when he was DA in Alabama.    What did AG's Lynch and Holder do after Baltimore and Furgeson  respectively? NOTHING  that's what!  No  no  no Mr. Lemon.  It is the Democrats who make racism  slavery  Jim Crow and segregation hallmarks of their political platform.  It was the Democrats who filibustered the Civil Rights Act.  It was the 1924 DNC Convention that refused to remove LYNCHING from it's platform.  It was Woodrow Wilson who RE-SEGREGATED the Federal Government.  It was FDR who appointed a KKK member to the Supreme Court.  Need more?,0
2861,Tsunamis like the one you are talking about have occurred before. It is a conceit of humans to think that a once in their lifetime event only happened to them. How can you be so sure that Mother Nature not still following "traditional" weather cycles? How do you really know that?,0

Vancouver prices are still 30% higher  have been for a few years  but now the “media” and the “bankers” have only just woken up as it’s in their backyard and are now saying toronto is in a bubble. still no mention of vancouver. well  welcome to the party. idiots.,1
2874,Actually  quite the opposite. Among other things  the ketone beta-hydroxybutyrate is a signalling metabolite that inhibits NLRP3 inflammatory activation  which inhibits cytokines production in chronic inflammation (so-called "angry inflammation")  which is a primary driving pathological process in cardiovascular disease.,0

2876,I get the uneasy feeling these idiots don't seem to know that dying is permanent.

2882,"Statutes are not instruments of praise  only reminders of our failures."    Seriously?  That's your argument... that confederate statutes are there to remind us of our failures? I would challenge you to find even one example of a statue installed for this purpose.  Does this look like a statue that was put up to remind us of the confederate failures?  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Edward_Lee_Sculpture    Drawing an equivalence between George Washington and Robert E. Lee because they both owned slaves completely ignores the fact that one led the rebellion that started our country  and the other one led a failed treasonous rebellion aimed at splitting it.,0

2884,Here we go again!,0
2885,Dear Tridentinus. I'm puzzled. Yesterday  I wrote about ALBA  the Latin American alliance based on justice and healing the planet  upbraiding our news sources for not at least informing us about this already-working model that would give us all at least the chance of saving life in Earth (posted 24 hours ago).  I concluded thus  "'The Anti-Trump' Pres. Macron's brilliant "Make our planet great again" must now be our guiding vision for a healed world. Declare INTERDependence. Please join us: http://paulbaker2004.wixsite.com/windyday. One Planet. One People."  Your entire response  no doubt carefully considered  was an emoj representing dissension. Be really glad to hear what exactly you disagree with. And why. Thank you.,0
2886,"white trash"?  So its ok to hate on people who are the working poor as long as they are white?  Im having a hard time following your religion of tolerance.  Its probably because I don't have a PhD like the rest of you all.  Le sigh.,1
2887,Dam right.  Also they are easy to  tell apart as beaver have their big flat  (noisy)  tails and nutria skinny rat tails.  And  while nutria will graze on grass  beaver  as is well known  chop down trees and chew the bark.  And they are so  darn cute we love 'em even if they are the OSU symbol.,0
2888,Its been widely reported that Obama's deportation stats were heavily padded by 'catch and release' at the border  which were never counted before he took office and should not be considered a 'deportation'. Trump's real achievement is the drastic reduction of illegals crossing the border  which is at the lowest rate in 17 years (according to Politifact).,0
2889,If you live 20 hours from TO  there is no way in hades your local municipality can even pay for one bridge replacement  let alone all the services in your area.,0
2890,So it wasn’t just a simple robbery of something that the letter writer doesn’t value very highly. This involved weapons and hostages.  Kidnapping and false arrest carry a pretty hefty price  and appropriately so. The Schoenfeld brothers and their bud Frederick Woods got life sentences for the 1976 Chowchilla  Calif.  kidnapping. All they did was steal a bus … with a bunch of kids on board. The kids and the bus driver escaped. (Richard and James Schoenfeld were paroled in 2012 and 2015  respectively and Woods remains in prison.),0
2891,Ironically the people who love this idea. are pension plans especially public service pension plans who have gobs of money to invest. After all they are the real rich in Canada..  If you have an issue with the fees you can talk to your kids teacher about it (Teachers pension Plan 172 billion in assets.),0
2892,While in a totally sterile logic only world  the author's premise has merit.  Unfortunately we don't live in that world.  It is politically and morally impossible to do what the author suggests.  Even if it means the possibility of a nuclear strike against one of our cities or our ally's cities.  We should however develop as quickly as possible defensive systems to stop such an attack.  Which I believe we are doing.  Also  if NK does launch such an attack  whether successful or not  we should not hesitate to completely destroy the whole NK government.,0
2893,It's becoming a habit with you.,0
2894,Good literature is good literature  whether Shakespeare or Mistry.  Anyone can have preferences.  I'm pretty sure that Mistry has read Shakespeare.  We all could benefit from both.,0
2895,It's odd that we're allowed to comment on this.,0
2896,Only a brain dead idiot would think that the Donald is clean.  Goes without saying that the Donald is guilty.    Have to laugh at phony republicans who for years complained about the honesty of democrats but today  are so quick to say well nothing has been proven yet.  Hell the crook in chief hasn't even been in office for a year and already has investigatgions all over.   Where there is smoke there is fire and there is a lot of smoke.  lol    Come on Donald  release your tax returns so that we can at least see how much you have paid mother Russia over the years.  I wonder if the Donald will eventually retire to mother Russia?  Once the Donald is gone  perhaps then the swamp can be drained.,1
2897,Of course the liberals are cheating  it's what they do  Thank the liars in the media for foisting this corrupt and incompetent pack of fools upon us. If not for their lies we would still have the best PM in the last 50 years still in office.,1
2898,Why do you publish this rubbish?,1
2899,Canada now has the largest bunch idiots representing this country that has ever been assembled,1
2900,What a stupid and/or misleading comment.  Harper chose to work in the real world as a mail room clerk when he was 18 before deciding what academic and career stream to pursue.  Unlike your hero the snowboard instructor and part time drama teacher who has zero accomplishments for the first 20 years of his adult life  Harper then earned an honours economics degree and later a masters  became chief of staff for senior Calgary MP  later the first chief of staff for the first Reform Party MP  later the director of policy development for Reform  later an MP and then president of a national citizens political advocacy group with some 50 000 members  etc.  etc.  You brag about having three degrees but when you make the ridiculous attempts to equate Trust Fund Trudeau`s anorexic resume with Harper`s you certainly make many of us skeptical about your academic background.  Clearly  research and logic were not part of your degrees program.,1
2901,The GOP is trying to blame Obama for the GOP congress not funding anything during Obama.  Yet more proof they don't understand how it works.,0
2902,DUDE!!! You're the A-Hole.  They corrected the article once I pointed out their glaring error.  Take a look at the "update" at the end of the article.  YOU should read the WHOLE article before telling someone else to read it.  Betcha feel so foolish now  huh Dude?,1
2903,Yes  he certainly can. The voices in his head told him so and there's nobody in the West Wing who is prepared to answer to the contrary.  "Scaramucci  Scaramucci  Can you do the Fandango?"  (I certainly hope so because you've got some really fancy dancing required of you in the few months before you run screaming from the White House.),0
2904,We already have people buying houses in Cottage Grove and Veneta and Junction City and Springfield and commuting to Eugene because they can't afford the houses in Eugene.  This is just a case where the people will be able to have a job with a lesser commute.,0
2905,Replanting is not an inductor of sustained yield as much as rate of cut. If a forest owner with a 1000 acres of fifty year old sawtimber cuts it out in 10 years and replants every acre they will run out of timber in 10 years. To sustain their 1000 acres they would have to cut 2% a year  20 acres instead of 100.  There are lots of industrial owners who cut their tree farms out at 8-10'% a year to repay acquisition costs. Hardly "sustainable".,0
2906,Strada: This idea  although similar ...that Comey is in a trial court in congress is either made up or misunderstood. Fire up your google and figure out what a congressional hearing is. Finally  the idea that one is innocent until proven guilty depends upon whether or not one can afford a lawyer in any democracy.,0
2907,"The project will: • Widen the roadway to five lanes." Just curious... Why doesn't the illustration above show five lanes?,0
2908,This statement doesn't make sense  I am sorry can you clarify what you are saying? Maybe I am misunderstanding.   Most dog owners are responsible. These people seem not to be able to. Responsible owners SHOULD be making the rules.   I don't understand how you are comparing kids to dogs going around killing people  and kids getting away with killing people? Please explain this statement.,0
2909,Sort of depends on who was on the jury.,0
2910,Driving high is dangerous?  What kind of an idiot doesn't know that?  Well  there are plenty of idiot potheads out there.,1
2911,No  it's not. You can't read it because the GOP didn't issue the full thing.  Here's the quote from the original story:  "But GOP leaders did not issue cost or coverage estimates for their plan"  You can't read what they haven't yet issued.  Thanks for playing  now go to the back of the line.,0
2912,Good job ADN...reading this makes me fear for democracy. Seriously..we need to get money out of elections  it is the road to corruption. Other countries have succeeded in this  one needs to wonder why there isn't a bill on the floor right now.,0
2913,Let’s start off with a definition of a democracy. Government by the people; a form of government in which the supreme power is vested in the people and exercised directly by them or by their elected agents under a free electoral system. The constitution defines South Africa as sovereign  democratic state as stated in the founding provisions. For those who believe these are up for debate the constitution further states  A Bill amending the Constitution may not include provisions other than constitutional amendments and matters connected with the amendments. Ok now let’s move on to the preamble which along with the founding provisions are the fundamental basis for the entire constitution and as such are considered to be invariant and self-evident. Here under the preamble we say that we freely; Lay the foundations for a democratic and open society in which government is based on the will of the people and every citizen is equally protected by law;,0

2918,You're a disgrace to the force....,1
2919,Andrew1 is just being nice. Sorry you are so offended.,0
2920,Someone set fire to the trash.,0
2921,Three things to remember over the next four years. First is treat every poisoned word as a promise. Don't try to analyze it or overthink it. If someone says hateful  horrible things  if someone threatens hateful  horrible actions  believe them. Second thing is treat people like adults. Treat people with respect. Do not condescend to them  which means hold them accountable for the consequences of their actions and demand that they behave like citizens. Third is refuse to accept what's going on as the new normal. People may evoke nuance  they may argue quite reasonably that some of the things that this administration does - it may not be so terrible  that some of the appointments that they make may be quite good. All that is possible  but I don't believe that this is a political challenge but rather a moral crisis facing America.,0
2922,John is always ready to hoist someone onto his petard to defend his right to debase anyone he thinks doesn't think the way he feels they should. Like so many liberals your words are acceptable as long as they agree with him!!,0
2923,About time Canada had its own policies again!,0
2924,Sexual predator?  Do you know something the police in Wyoming don't know?  I doubt it.  You are guilty of slander.  You should be ashamed.,0
2925,There is a good  scientific reason for so very many of the comments posted here by the compassionless right folks!   Poor dears and bless their hearts.  http://www.rawstory.com/2017/05/study-finds-link-between-brain-damage-and-religious-fundamentalism/,0
2926,OMG  what a horrific post -- and so awful because it's close to true (not sure all those dudes were actually elected but I'm no historian).  This is the part I don't think friends of Trump are able to see...the grim possibilities looming with Bannon & company "in charge."  Thanks for the pail of cold water reality. What a nightmare we could be facing.,0
2927,But you got to be real about it. You have to...,0
2928,You are only telling half of the story.  The other half is that production of higher end products  like the RAV4 and the Lexus Nx are to ramped up to maintain employment  and Canada will end up exporting a higher dollar value.  SUV's are hot in the market right now.   Better volume growth potential than with the Corolla.,0
2929,Bang on as usual Ms. Wente!  I also grew up cutting trees to pay for school  and in subsequent years planted trees.  Forests are a renewable resource and our people need to be able to use it responsibly- as the vast majority of individual land owners and companies do.    These Greenpeace folks  who are unlikely to have any first hand experience in forestry (or have done a day of hard work in their lives)  have no business judging those who know the subject best and are actively engaged in the industry.  Greenpeace comes across as a band of ignorant hypocrites  blind to the human suffering their extremism and lies cause.,1
2930,Put him to sleep before he kills people,1
2931,Dumb  just dumb. What a dangerous proposal to simply "buy" votes.  Ludicrous.,1
2932,This is just freaking sad. Another great place lost to greedy developers building more huge apartments in an already crowded area. So long Portland  you are becoming the worst city ever.,1
2933,Interesting proposal that makes a lot of sense. Not only are we sitting on vast oil deposits in glorious North Dakota and elsewhere  but our untapped natural gas reserves are virtually unlimited.  The emergency oil stockpile has become an anachronism in a new world of technological advancement.,0
2934,you live in hate pally  your delusions on trump demonstrate your ignorance the usa is about to get back to being great after 8 year of being run by a narcissistic self interest child,1

2937,Five O'clock Somewhere you need to find a time zone where it IS five O'clock and MOVE there.,0
2938,You hear it's only xxx amount and only accounts for .001%. of the problem. Every penny counts! Our folks in Juneau need to be watching every penny. They add up  10 pennies equal 10 cents  100 equal 1 dollar  1000 equal $10.00 dollars  10000 equal  $100.00. every penny counts!!! Current folks in Juneau seem to for get this. We need to remind them this is an issue. They seem to forget we the people  are the ones who put them in office. We the people can put them out on their ASS. If we don't hold them to a high standard  we are the dumb ass!!!!!!!!!,1
2939,than you fully understand no former tenant has the legal right to tie up rental property they have not paid rent on in months  and you can legally remove the contents so you can rent the property. Furthermore you cannot break into your own property.  Obviously he let his better judgment get the best of him. If not for the fact guns were involved the cops would have laughed and told the delinquent to sue for his shit in court.,1
2940,All of the salt in BC is in Richmond - in the won ton soup.,0
2941,Comey came across as competent  articulate cvil servant.  He called a spade a spade and has passed his papers along to the appropriate authority.  This column is vituperative  shallow  and giving it space was really not worthy of Canada's national newspaper.,0
2942,Putin has about 30 IQ points on Trump.  Which is why Trump works for Putin  and not the other way around.,0
2943,Disclaimer: I am not liberal or conservative. But you "right" people  at this very moment  are the biggest gaping assholes on the face of this planet. First of all  that is a horrid fucking dress. She looks like a 12 year old girl wearing that color  although it does reflect her intelligence and maturity level. Secondly  having a dress with a color as bright as that  at a meeting as important as she attended  is completely distracting and takes away from any message she tried to convey.   How can you right cunts not see that? You can't truly be that naive? Oh I forgot  you all punch butts and bite pillows.,1
2944,Happy birthday Mina!,0
2945,Anchorage should hire Dr. Paramo  and Dr. Atwater should become MatSu's superintendent. Done and done.,0
2946,OH my god. A woman divorced the nation's least funny actor. She should be BURNED ALIVE.,1
2947,Perhaps the real terrorists here are Mr Sneer and his little minions who seem obsessed with nothing more than the destruction of Canada's ability to gain a positive outcome re-NAFTA.  They are very sick people.  They just don't have the foresight to understand that they will not win the next election with childish behaviour like they are not exhibiting.,1
2948,What a fool you are.  What's more  you do not have the courage to use your own name in such comments.  Foolish and cowardly.,1
2949,I'M NOT YET MARRIED.,0
2950,But .... and here is the Most Important Question:  Is this statement part of the ordinary magisterium .... or is it an Infallible Utterance?  Maybe the BVM will appear on an Italian pizza (sausage and mushroom  extra mozzarella  per favore) and give us the answer before the next Reformation takes place.,0
2951,California is trying to implement single payer.  Cost is only double what the entire state budget is.  I don't think it is going to work out all that well for them.  Veterans endure single payer at the VA.  How's that working out for them so far?    The other thing single payer does is lead directly to rationing and a dual-tier medical system.  The well-connected insiders get good medical care.  Those who aren't get directed to placebos or better yet  assisted suicide.  Netherlands and Oregon are traveling this path much faster than anyone would want to consider.    Like education  the more control you can put of money paid for medical care in the hands of patients  the cheaper and more responsive that medical care actually is.  Single payer moves that control a long  long away.  Cheers -,0
2952,Can't this trash be kept out of Colorado? Those meddling old tools should keep their idiot policies in failed brownbeckistan (Kansas) and failing walkersconsin (WI) where they're dying to destroy those states with their craven policies.,1
2953,Fire the abusers!,1
2954,With respect to the ISER studies  none so far have addressed what the economic impact would be that an income tax would have on small towns and cities that are already collecting a borough wide and local sales tax.  It seems that a small but loud component in Anchorage  Alaska's most populated city  and its school district  annually run up multi million dollar deficits  are adverse to taking responsibility for their own fiscal irresponsibility.  Instead of increasing property taxes  creating and expanding programs it can't afford  and a school district that can't control its spending  wouldn't it be fairer for Anchorage to adopt a 8-9% sales tax?  Why should residents of Seward be forced to pay an income tax  because Anchorage can't get their fiscal house in order. Isn't restructuring the PF enough for the state to get by on?,0
2955,I watched Bernie on TV last night.  He tripled the national debt in one hour.,0
2956,Quit posting idiotic comments and I won't respond.  Simple aint it?,1
2957,No  he didn't. NSA does have accountability built firmly into its culture  nothing in the document dump by Snowden showed otherwise. Every action that they take has to be reconciled with the laws governing intelligence surveillance  as judged by special courts. Snowden showed a couple of things: First  that the law allowed a breadth of surveillance that the general public would not have guessed was happening (though privacy advocates had long suspected)  and second  that certain laws had been fairly broadly interpreted by the surveillance court in a couple of cases  very likely beyond what the legislators had intended when they wrote the law.  If NSA was wiretapping Trump Tower  then they had court permission to do so  which means they had probably cause. And they would have been required  by law  to not record or keep any domestic calls. Only if the other end was foreign would it have been legal for a call to become part of intel.,0
2958,The thirteenth of march is meant to be unlucky.,0
2959,Islam needs to be declared a terrorist organization then they will not fall under the 1st amendment.  Of course there are some good Muslims but the risk factors are too great to allow this so called religion to go unchecked.  Japan bars Muslims and the Koran.,1
2960,Elitists think the common man is too stupid to make 'good' decisions and therefore must be disenfranchised and have policy thrust upon them  as much as possible  without their input. Given the up and down votes on the various comments here  it seems the Elitist club is alive and well. God save the Queen! You folks were just born to tell other people what to do  in keeping with your impeccable wisdom & hubris  weren't you?,1
2961,the nerve of them!,0
2962,hey loser  you were attempting to discredit him based on some fantasy not sessions good work  but as usual lefties hate being exposed for posting stupidity,1
2963,So what question was asked?  Polling companies can changed the results of a poll easily when they call people from previous polls and already know which way they swing.  Not to mention does anyone believe polls anymore?,0
2964,Trump opened this particular Pandora's Box during the campaign  with his usual oral diarrhea. His supporters loved it. Karma took notice. Good.   Depp has one thing in common with Trump. Lying for a living. A pox on them both.,1
2965,Paul  again  points out the truth behind the leadership a few voted for to take over our country. We see each day the choices  some really stupid  some scary  some just mean  and others short sighted. I can not find a single choice little d has made that really gets at a long term solution to a problem...just campaign slogans and knee-jerk reactionary leadership. And yes some of what we could call neo-facist  nationalist  racist...but mostly stupid. The stink of racism is always around some in the GOP...our current attorney general is making choices that lay the groundwork for totalitarian leaders. Funny how easy it is to gets his supporters riled up about fake threats  and suggest simplistic solutions to complex problems  then try to make change in rules that have the affect of undermining our ability to live in a complex  international  global world. The only thing a wall will do is increase the already amazing tunneling ability of talented drug cartels.  Really stupid choices!,1
2966,The "cottages" in the background of the photo? Looks like Scarborough.,0
2967,Jeez I wonder why I (avg. Canadian) am drowning in debt: Is it the million dollar home? or Is it my condo bought as investment? or Is it the brand new SUV parked in the garage? or Is it the Europe vacation we took last summer? or  Is it the latest ipads/Macbooks kids needed for school? ... Oh! Can't wait to put the latest iphone X on my platinum credit card! (of course sarcasm intended).,0
2968,"Of course you should  you silly ass " said Gussie genially.,1
2969," lower income people pay zero taxes or next to zero" If you make more than the basic deduction (Approx $11K last I looked) then you start paying tax at a combined rate of about 20%. That's not nothing. At minimum wage you would make $20K/year so you would be paying $1 800. And you still pay EI and CPP.,0
2970,Congratulations Mr President!,0
2971,No  the 'ultimate deflection' was and is 'Russia hacked the election'. That deflects from the fact Hillary actually lost and in states where it was close  she lost by even more votes after a 'hand recount'.   . Campaign contributions from foreign entities are  illegal  but volunteering is not. Russians could  have legally volunteered for  the Trump campaign  under the rules of... https://www.fec.gov/updates/foreign-nationals/.....making  any meetings between the Trump campaign and Russians  nothing more than a political 'distraction' by the Democrats.    If Russian information(propaganda) helped Trump win  it wasn't illegal at all  unless they contributed money .  John McCain was accused of violating these laws  back in 2008  I wonder how many times the Clinton campaign violated them with any 'other' foreign entities?

2974,Moore is right and schools continue to be underfunded (where is the much promised new air conditioning?). The bottom line answer is that the taxpayers have to pony up more funds overall  period  full stop. There is not another solution to bring "free money" from somewhere else to subsidize us for all the things we  as the public  need  such as schools  infrastructure  and low income housing  and pensions/retirement funds and so on. Get real  we need to raise taxes. Hawaii has the some of the lowest property taxes in the country  partly because our property taxes do not pay for the schools! Lets add a little to the GE Tax rate  just as we did for HART  and help schools  and build some low income housing. And  raise the gas tax so we can fix some roads and bridges. Get our heads out of the stand  and stop being in denial that government is underfunded. And  spend some money to upgrade skills for public employees who have to oversee some of these big contractors like Keiwit and others.,0
2975,Have ya tried changing up the menu?,0
2976,What a silly child you are. Drunken groping of a minor indicates the political affiliation of one's parents - of course it does.  Conservatives are all moral and law-abiding; progressives are all immoral law-breakers. What a juvenile world view - and  of course  easily refuted. But please  do go on spouting these amusing bits of "wisdom". You're a bastion of predictability in an uncertain world.,1

2979,During the primaries I had hoped for the election of a candidate that would restore some class and dignity to the Office of the President. Somehow I don't think it'll be Donald Trump.,0
2980,I thought the same thing.  Does Ikaika Anderson believe that those of us who use artificial trees for whatever reason (convenience  frugality  etc.) are not experiencing a "real" Christmas?,0
2981,I like TJ but with his contract situation  age and the fact that the #3 guy (Jamal Carter) is having a very good camp  it may make sense to see what the trade market will bear. Could be a win/win situation for any team looking for a proven Pro-Bowl safety who still has prime playing years left at age 30. A player or a pick that can help make the Broncos better as a team has to be considered.,0
2982,The right is projecting again. When they decry something it's because they are guilty of what they are projecting about.   The right are gigantic hypocrites. They voted for Dump  after he was caught on tape  bragging about sexually assaulting women. And watched filth like O'Loofah after they already had to know he was a sexual harasser on a network run by a serial sexual harasser.    And yet  they still whine about Clinton (!) and Weinstein.,1
2983,margaret. its exactly what I expected from. Fawning and gushing about a President in a foreign country that did SFA for 8 years and even less for the last 4. Great orator but nothing else!!

2987,"Alaska has no chance as long as such nitwits remain."  Exactly.  We can't expect these morons to fix anything.  This is why I keep suggesting we collect the billions owed from audits and wait until we have a completely new legislature before making any big moves.  Why would we let these incompetent corrupt idiots start an income tax and tap the permanent fund earnings?,1
2988,Cyril must really think we're stupid. He's no better than Jacob.,1
2989,It is unfortunate that the entire lie called the Affordable Care Act wasn’t flushed down the toilet by the Congress. The damn thing isn’t affordable if you are a young American struggling to create your own life while at the same time being forced to subsidize rich old folks. People’s premiums have doubled to pay for those who dont buy a policy for themselves which cut into their alcohol and marijuana budgets. Without subsidies to the insurance companies  who are forced to sell Cadillac plans to everyone  the entire house of cards falls over.  Eradicate this governmental cancer.  We should all be able to buy our health insurance on Amazon.com like everything else we want... or don’t want.   Do you want a shortage of anything?  Put the government in charge.    There is no law establishing these illegal subsidies to insurance companies. These payments are illegal. The same idiots who designed this failed model now want to force everyone into single payer insurance.  Don’t let them.,1
2990,Thanks for the link rational  Iv read it already though. The fact remains that here in Ontario among other provinces and soon to be federally mandated  the theory of gender expression is protected by law with punitive measures applied to people who deny it. Before you go lecturing me  you might want to re-visit your elementary school science education and review the lessons you learned in basic  fundamental objective scientific methodology. Protecting a theory from probing and questioning through legislation that punishes  people for questioning it is about as unscientific as it get and refusing to allow your scientific theories to be questioned would have seen you fail grade 6. Carry on yourself  as you will,0
2991,Why are so many around Trump so very dirty and dangerously unAmerican?  Why is Trump's family itself so sleazy?  This is the president from Hell.  Why on earth would such a dreadful  ignorant  reckless person elected?  Makes no sense.,1
2992,represents Kalifornia for the last 132 years.............she is ' heimers ' eligible.  Doesnt she have anything to do in life?  pathetic and disgusting.,1
2993,It boils down to one very simple fact. We are subsidizing the oil industry   and paying that subsidy with the PFD. Government can  and should function without a " Permanent Fund ". The Fund belongs to the people (Residents) of Alaska  and NOT the Alaska State Government that is trying to make laws  rules  and regulations that would allow them access to a very large amount of money. The strategy was   and is  to squander what we have and then go after the PFD. Much like the tax cut for the wealthy  and the benefits cuts in Social Security which also belongs to the Citizens. There is a pattern   and it is to bleed the General public for as much as possible  and then find ways to steal it.,0

3025,I think people get turned off by the title "Sanctuary City". Take away all the extra political rhetoric and you understand why so many US cities are "sanctuary cities" even if they do not call themselves that. These include Republican and conservative cities-- and police departments are often taking this position even if Mayor's and council members are not. It is just common sense and a reflection of what the law is. This article from Fox News by a friend of Trump's-- retired judge Napolitano-- that explains this well:  http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/12/08/judge-andrew-napolitano-are-sanctuary-cities-legal.html,0

3036,What about the people right now who don't have health insurance because the rates skyrocketed with Obamacare?  I know two people (self employed professionals) who had to give up health insurance because they could no longer afford it.  Ironically  one of them is a health care professional and she treats Adults who have free care due to expanded Medicaid. I feel sorry for my hard working friends and I don't feel sorry for anyone who would have to give up "expanded Medicaid" (in the unlikely event Congress votes to repeal.) Because it was unfair for medicaid to be expanded to able bodied adults!  So now  hard working adults are paying extra taxes to pay for these freeloaders.  This is not American!  What ever happened to our country's morals and values?,0

3039,This writer is trapped in the notion of a free trade system... and by those rules he is correct... but TRUMP is going to change the rules..... and then free trade which has become an overextended dependence for nation states will not be the best choice... balanced economies which will be much more sustainable for citizens and the planet will be the way to go.,0
3040,The judge is a (D)onkey. The fact the judge did not follow the law and ruled as a Political Democrat and not a fair and balanced judge is a complete joke.   As for calling Hawaii an island in the Pacific  DUH we are an island in the Pacific.  It's insane how much the Democrats hate Trump and his people it's really getting disgusting.,1

3052,Hopefully  the Governor will disregard this plea and in the alternative will take up the cause of these people by promoting immigration law reform.  Hard working or not  undocumented immigrants are no more than invaders into this  or any other country  in which they wish to reside by violating the law.  I think most Americans agree immigrants are welcome into this country but invaders are not.,0

3055,Wow...mostly wind.  I think Krugman is a liberal  and there were GOP liberals and progressives  back when they read their bibles. Is he partisan? So what!  I'm sure he has thought about the issues and I appreciate what he's saying...the angry white males voted for people whose policies hurt them. And yes Pres. Bill Clinton  who was the best Republican President since Eisenhower  did some dumb things in the name of deregulation that screwed up banking and helped create the bubble...but so did lines of credit tied to your house and lower taxes on the wealthy.  The lines of credit created another bubble  one that masked the lack of wages  as people spent their equity. You could buy a car by borrowing money on your home... a really stupid idea  and something Krugman warned about. So yes they are angry  yet if they think Trump gives a crap  they are wrong  again. And they will somehow blame me for their stupidity.,1
3056,These considerations about the Air Forca and marine mammals are good but it should extend to all of the military branches and not to just marine mammals.   I would like to think that someone is smart enough to find ways to test/improve our weaponry with out "collateral damage" to life in the ocean.  Did an island the size of Kahoolawe really need to be sacrificed as a target?  Ask lots of hard questions and get some good answers.  The ocean needs all of the help it can get and it is a dangerous world   ... we need weapons.,0
3057,DO they not understand that "religious association approved by the assembly" is a can of worms being opened up? Who are they to determine approval for the borough?

3062,Mr Balbert touches on a number of today's social/political/economic issues and says  in essence  "I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore."  His statements are contentious......some will agree with him  some disagree with him on each.  But  let's all agree  they are timely  they are thought-provoking and they all need to be addressed.  Mr. Balbert.....thanks for your letter....Indeed  we do need to all step-up and face the issues you raise.  regards  Gary,0
3063,I am glad that the court was able to come to the obvious and correct conclusion with only the usual suspects dissent.  When someone declines to do their job for religious reasons they need to change jobs. Employers should be able to dismiss anyone who does not serve the customer and business owners ought to serve all customers. There are many employed in the religion business so they ought do that. There they need only serve those who accept the same deity. God needs no prescriptions filled and Mary needed no contraception.,0

3068,Speaking of hockey---I would encourage all hockey fans to not renew their season tickets until the Aces show they are willing to put a decent product on the ice.  Money talks and the Aces won't improve anything as long as they have around 3500 people to show up each game .   I'd also tell those who love hockey to go back to supporting UAA hockey . At least with UAA hockey you see players on the way up vs on the way down as with current Aces hockey.   With so many people in the Anchorage area  we have enough hockey fans to support both programs .  In a perfect world we'd support both.  At this point in time UAA hockey deserves our support   and the Aces don't.,0
3069,Kimo Sutton  The level of public health is highly correlated with the prevalence of health care insurance.  So it is disturbing that the Republican health care proposals in the House and Senate would kick more than 20 million Americans off health care insurance.  Those proposals demonstrate that the health of Americans is not a high priority of Republicans.  All other developed nations have adopted universal health care.  Instead of moving toward that goal  Republicans want to take America backwards.,0

3074,The legislature. Maybe you need to pay attention more? If we are *only* counting children and elderly  highly doubt we'd be even close to 30%. There are some young  able-bodied people mooching off the system  I see it everyday. And to say I have hatred is quite an assumption Alaskan Fish. I never said I hated anyone  simply annoying and frustrated to be part of the working class that is constantly asked to give more while seeing the abuse of people who figure out the system and don't better themselves to not need it  they take the easy way and hang on for every dollar they can get for as long as they can. The "parasites" you called *are* the problem  as they are using a majority of the services that are the most expensive expenditures in the budget.,1
3075,The Nation team is on a 5 day hiatus...Good for them..   BUUUUUTTTTTT.. With the exception of the All Star break  the Nation has 2 2 day breaks between now and the end of the season.

I just hope Marner and Matthews stay healthy  as far as the rest of the team goes   I could care less. But those 2 guys are great players.,0
3076,The sad truth is that many businesses pay too much rent to landlords. So the business is caught in a squeeze between staff costs and rent. This should not be taken out on the minimum wage earner. At some point the multi-national leasing companies and the large property owners must realize that you can not get blood from a stone and start to lower their rent expectations. Once again the money in retail flows up to the wealthy not to the workers. Any store which pays less than $15.00 per staff hour needs to re-evaluate their business model. We have too much retail space which has rent priced too high - we need fewer stores  but better stores.,0

3088,Trump has not said that climate change does not exist; he said that the extent of human contribution to climate change may have been vastly exaggerated.  Forms of “clean energy” will be adopted whenever and wherever they become less expensive than what is used now. What Trump should — correctly — combat is financial support of projects that are not based on demonstrated market demand; i.e.  not copy the Ontario model  or any of the EU models that have by now been reversed).   Let Common Sense prevail!,0
3089,Kenneth Conklin  You apparently don't realize that you are already paying for long term care for other people  assuming you are a taxpayer.  A total of $1.5 Billion in State and federal funds is appropriated annually to Hawaii's Medicaid program  most of which goes to providing institutionalized long term care to disabled elderly people who are not able to afford it.  As you may know  institutionalized long term care is a very expensive proposition.    The proposal offered by the author of the article would help provide for home care  thereby keeping people out of institutionalized long term care  and reducing the financial stress on the Medicaid program.  That program would help families care for their disabled elderly members  which is a growing concern due to the aging population.,0

3096,Yes  why would anyone want to condemn someone such as president Donald Trump? Such an exemplary human being. Someone we can look up to and tell our children to emulate.  A modest  self-made man from humble beginnings who had to work his way up from a tough childhood. A trust-worthy man. An honest man who takes responsibility for his actions. A forthright man with nothing to hide. A gracious  polite man who respects one and all  particularly those less fortunate than him. An intelligent  well read man  grounded in the history and best traditions of this country. A man in command of the facts. A man who is measured and not prone to rash actions. A man who does not lie and keeps his promises.  Let's all bow down to Mr. Trump together  Mr. Pilling. We are so lucky to have him as president. And thank God we no longer have to put up with that rascal Obama. I mean  all I need to know is that he is a "liberal" Democrat  that's enough right there to condemn him.,0
3097,I see his Lordship is making pronouncements again.  Thank you for honoring the unwashed with your response.  You do realize that the IOM limits show that there is a risk of adverse effects to infants consuming formula mixed with fluoridated water?  It's all right here:  http://www.nationalacademies.org/hmd/~/media/Files/Activity%20Files/Nutrition/DRI-Tables/4_%20UL%20Values_Vitamins%20and%20Elements.pdf?la=en  Why do you have so little concern for the health of formula fed infants  especially when we know that infants retain up to 87% of ingested fluoride compared to adults who only retain 50%.  Don't you ever wonder if giving a baby 150 times the daily dose of fluoride that they would have received had they been breastfed  might have some detrimental effects on the developing brain and other organs that might be permanent.  Do you have any research  that looked for possible harms in those who consumed fluoridated formula in their first year  but didn't find any?,0
3098,Headline is from the Institute of the Obvious – of course this is a change for the worse.  The truly sad part is that if fear on the part of the general populace and intrusions into daily life on the part of the government escalate  the perpetrators have a toehold on achieving their aims.

3106,Back in the day  (1875 until the 1930's) there used to be train service from Toronto to Gravenhurst.  Resorts then transported their guests by boat or wagon to their final destinations.  Perhaps they could reinstitute the service?  North up express?,0

3109,From Warsaw to Hamburg to Paris  the First Lady wowed the Europeans with her poise and beauty.  The French especially were beside themselves with her panache and diplomacy  -- she favored St Laurent  Hervé Pierre  and Chanel for the  Paris visit.  From Paris Match to Le Monde  the French press gave her nothing but rave reviews -- e.g. PM "First Lady très  élégante à Paris."  Melania speaks six languages  is an excellent mother  and is a superb representative for both the United States & Slovenia.  Très belle et très bon fait  Melania!,0
3110,An irrational person (criminal/mentally ill) can use anything to justify criminal or anti-social behavior.  The media jumping on an innocent comment and warping it simply provides more opportunity for irrational people to latch on to something.  The Dallas police murderer  Orlando night club murderer  abortion doc murderer  and as you referred  a long sad history of irrational people doing what they want.  There will always be whack jobs who do whatever they want.  Trump's comments were in no way meant to incite violence and to say so is simply playing the outrage card and does nothing to promote civil discourse.  Twisting comments to make political hay is disgusting and intellectually dishonest.,1

3119,Doubtful Pence was the other Donalds's first choice but rather that of his family/Paul Manafort.  Since we are solidly in the territory of you-couldn't-write-this-crap I will toss this one out.  Trump will either "fire" Pence or the Guvnor will quit the ticket.  The cracks are already there  just a matter of time.,1
3120,As if anyone needed more validation that Trump is an imbecile  bigot  pathological liar and sociopath  this tweet should seal the deal for his sycophants.  He cannot change policy by tweeting.  He knows absolutely nothing about governing.  Worst President Ever.  He can't be removed from off quickly enough.,1

3128,25 years of seasonal work  off on UI for those 25 years  it's a great deal but no future in it.

Tenancies are carried by the property not the owner unless vacant possession was requested. Should have had a lease signed before the property changed hands.,0
3129,i am sorry to hear about your folks. call the RG with your story.,0
3130,Wonderful skewering of the aspiring "Fat-Shamer in Chief" by Tiothy Egan in today's NY Times:  "So  in the spirit of the discourse that Trump has brought us to  let’s objectify the Republican nominee on his terms. This guy is fat. Bigly. He’s got an extra chin  a gut you wouldn’t want to see riding above a bathing suit  and a rear that serves no purpose but ballast.  At 6-foot-2  the height that he has long given profile writers  ... [b]y government guidelines  Trump is obese. In a weasel move to avoid that classification  Trump now says he is 6-foot-3  which makes him merely overweight. How he grew an inch  at the age of 70  is a story that has escaped his hagiographers at Fox.  Trump’s ducktail hairdo  colored in a hue unknown to nature  is a complicated comb-over inspired by Dr. Seuss.  Trump’s hands are smaller than 85 percent of American men. No surprise he lies about that.  'Fat  drunk and stupid is no way to go through life' (from Animal House) .. Trump .. has two of the three.",1

3135,Most people who are fixated on how you have "sex" with another female your "wife" Suzy are the religious nuts. When I see a couple hetro or gay the last thing I would ever image in my mind is how they do the deed. I find that gay couples now legally can be welcomed into marriage by law but they get stuck with the same things that the hetro couples take for granted such as fighting  infidelity  domestic violence and divorce court. The gays fought a heard battle to have the same rights as hetros  but in reality they get all the crap that comes with the "sacred" institution of marriage that comes with it and some want to take that away from them?   LOL,1
3136,Taverns and microbreweries are the problem? Travelers  dogs and the homeless are not customers of these establishments as they don't have the money to spend there. They hang around on the sidewalks outside  freaking out everyone who walks by. Aggressive panhandlers and lunging dogs are the problem  not long time tax paying businesses with family wage jobs that are highly regulated and monitored by the state.,0

3140,Probably Trump's attack was illegal. It may even be a source of regret in years to come for the precedent that it has set. Still  Assad's crimes are monstrous and he has it coming.

3147,Noah will feel right at home with the local crowd and a large portion of his act will be bashing the President and his family. I wonder if the Trump "bashing"  so prevalent in Hawaii  is a good strategy for the State in the long run. Whether you like him or not  the President has a lot of ability to "get things done". I believe there are a few areas where Hawaii could use the President's attributes. Does anyone disagree?,0
3148,Our tax dollars were spent rescuing this idiot. I expect him to express gratitude toward his rescuers and to publicly denounce his captors  then shut up and get a job to support his family.  This is a situation he put his family in and he should be so embarasesd by his stupidity that we never have to hear from him again.  Poor kids. Wife is a dolt for going with him when pregnant.

3152,The comments are very interesting and say a lot about the public's perception of the police department in Honolulu. I think that anyone who has paid attention to the ongoing police dramas  not only on Oahu  but on every island  lost faith long ago. The Police Commission in Oahu hasn't  historically  provided any real oversight of the department but has acted in concert with the Department to deprive the public of any real insight into the workings of the department. Maybe that could change . . probably not.,0

3157,Burnsie: I agree  no issue with the Stars  but Buds simply did not contain or cover very well and therefore their defensive game went south.  They were also holding onto the puck and not shooting quickly enough. Although they out-shot  the Stars  their shots were of very poor quality. I somewhat expected this soft start  partly because of their  inexperience and questionable leadership and partly because of the split in season. Rielly's presence could  have made the difference  but then I am guessing here.,0
3158,The article does not say who prevailed  only that it was settled. Do you have more information from another source?,0

3165,The Canadian Government has stood its ground (and promised to stand its ground in the future) on all interests and values of important to the large majority of Canadians but consistently coupled this firm stand with assurances in tone and substance that Canada remains ready to engage constructively with the US to seek mutual advantage consistent with our interests and values.  This is Canada's stance with all nations; the only unique feature concerning the new US Administration in this regard is that our Government needs to be especially clear while avoiding unintended confrontation.  This it has done well to date.,0

3169,What a load of crap. You're comparing apples to oranges. Michelle Obama was vilified by the right for everything from wearing sleeveless dresses to wanting kids to be more active to planting a frigging vegetable garden at the White House. Your article makes it sound like no one ever said a bad word about her in 8 years. Let's never forget that Melania made the rounds on the right wing media outlets in support of her husband's racist birther crap.,1
3170,Rationalthought...I understand what you're trying to say  and i agree with your major points  but you can't get there by starting with believing.  What I really believe you want to say is " police should start by not being dismissive about the complaint....which is to say  they should not be biased against the person claiming to be a victim. ...they should not start by believing ( which is bias in the positive )  they should start by not disbelieving ( which is the absence of bias in the negative ),0
3171,I think it's moderated by other members... each time we post comments here  we're forced to read three other comments and rate whether they are "good" or not and whether they are "civil." Twice I've been warned that I've rated comments as civil although they break their guidelines... whatever.   I figure a comment is civil unless you're using profanity or personally attacking other poster.,0

What is it about your selfish lot that is so offended by the most minor suggestion to help others where you can  and perhaps  instead of getting by on $8.4 billion  you get by on $7.4 billion? Or $8.3 billion? Your lot is convinced the whole world is out to steal your lunch money when there is a STRONG reality that there are people that need lunch money  and the need is independent of their effort...

3189,Caffeine is also considered a drug. God forbid the day I don't have that before driving to work. The point of the matter is they need a way to test for current impairment  not to mention level of impairment  like alcohol. Is one puff going to give me a DUI or will it take a whole blunt? These things need to be tested. Maybe if the Feds would get their heads out of their butts they would be all over this  making it available for testing in labs. Also  many jobs that are not safety sensitive require drug tests  so what you do at home on your private time with no harm to anyone else  will cost you your job. People like Richard support drug testing for everyone  and like to take away your freedom to smoke A PLANT. America!,0

3191,"Black men are primarily responsible for that." This part of your statement is true. This country would not exist were it not for millions of black slaves. The colonies from Maryland south would never have joined the "Revolution" without protections for race based slavery. We would be more like Canada without race based slavery.  In 1860  80% of the wealth of the nation was from slaves  slave labor  and the products that labor produced. The violence today is a product of our history. The rest of your statement is just fake news.,1

3196,The US medical system is the best in the world. People from all parts of the globe go to the US for treatment. What is missing is a connection between that medical system and  the American people  especially the poor. There is also a poor connection between the poor and welfare systems. Government run housing is an example.  Those two problem areas can be solved with a Guaranteed Annual Income FOR THE POOR.  That could do away with Medicaid and Medicare and all the local welfare programs. And it should appeal to Republicans. It would mean that the poor could manage their own lives. No massive bureaucracy looking after housing for example. The poor find their own.   So the US could move from the poorest health care system in the developed world to the best. And an unbeatable welfare system. What a chance for Trump to score.,0
3197,"take apart the Permanent Fund" is a bit of hyperbole. Maybe you meant "take apart the dividend". Indeed  that may seem like bitter medicine but it WILL make us better.  I don't disagree that the tax credit program is broken but I think we should be careful making radical changes at current market conditions.,0
3198,Exactly  due to the fact the vast majority of the whites in the Rust Belt in Florida are as dumb as a post these fake Hillary news stories caused them to vote for Trump.

3199,McGee you're wrong as usual. My current account  is restricted because of people who can't stand it when someone has an oppositional view.

In the meantime I've NEVER directly insulted any commentator here since I feel it undermines my argument  and yet I'm banned: not for insults like yours  but for trenchant and by any intelligent free-society standard 'civil' comments  that happen to fly in the face of 'SUNNY WAYS' narratives espoused by 'L'eftist media. Haha! what a sick joke. I'm just going to be creating a new account and spreading the 'truth' as I know it to be  no matter how many times I get BANNED and no matter how many children pretending to be adults come at me with their capricious petulant vindictiveness: you children are about narcissism.

Trump supporters (so far mostly elderly and from the south) are seeing him as a total victim and nothing is is his fault and the big ole meanies just don't understand him and if they don't stop picking on him [there is going to be a civil war] I kid you  not.  WJ has even lightened up on bad words cause they're now coming from these poor souls.  I swear djt can do no harm in their eyes.  It's amazing.  I've mentioned the program here several times and I'll continue to do so.  Today a half hour was devoted to the tax reform and at least we had some honest business men calling in.

3227,Isn't this what the Founder had in mind with the establishment of three branches of government. Congress for eight years has had a pass. Obama didn't want Congressional Democrat to have to go on the record  which automatically gave Republicans a pass. With Congress not being term limited  a President in his second term can legislate  and Congress then doesn't have to explain to voters why they voted for  or why they voted against  because the President act on their behalf. Thus eliminating any accountability.,0

3234,"The 'Medicare for All Act of 2017' would repeal Obamacare  along with most other private and public insurance  and replace it with a government-run  one-size-fits-all  centrally directed system of reimbursement for medical expenses. Sanders  who honeymooned in the Soviet Union  holds the same opinion of health insurance as he does antiperspirants: 'You don't necessarily need a choice of 23 underarm spray deodorants or of 18 different sneakers when children are hungry in this country.'"  http://freebeacon.com/columns/democrats-follow-bernie-sanders-off-cliff/  Translation of Sanders' proposal:  "You're too stupid to think for yourself.

3236,How much tax revenue has the state lost because of our Hawaiian-style "governance"?   I want a number.  Inquiring tax payers want to know.  I also want to know who can help provide medical marijuana cards.  Kaiser didn't  Straub doesn't.,0

3239,I agree with you 100% about people having to feel some pain to make the changes in Juneau that need to be made.  Where you and I disagree  I think  is that you only want those that earn a living to feel that pain. Now if you're wanting to make sure that everyone feels the effect of poor leadership than the only way to do that is for everyone to feel the same pain. Because one person works hard and is successful he/she shouldn't be the only one to suffer. If everyone feels the same pain  everyone will vote for someone that may be able to make a change. As long as you "promise" to protect some people from that pain  those same people will vote them in office. I'm not asking for anything but equal opportunity and treatment. Nothing more and nothing less.,0
3240,Lautenberg Amendment does not cover a Military conviction of Assault. There is no Domestic Assault in the Military Judicial Code. It only pertains to citizen convictions.

3241,I don't really care. The more the Muslim world chews itself up the better for us.,1
3242,I agree 100% with the proposals. This topic is very emotional in the States  making rational solutions difficult. One of the NRA's favorite statements is that "guns don't kill people  it is people who kills people" and they therefore resist all forms of gun control. It is time that everybody realizes that what the proponents of gun control in essence want is people control - not putting guns in the hands of the wrong people  not putting automatic weapons and bump stocks and whatever else in the hands of people who are not authorized to use it and have no real need for it. The members of the NRA should still legally be entitled to own guns  if they meet the criteria. That way of thinking may help both sides to reach an acceptable compromise.,0

He probably is not any more mentally ill than the rest of the Republicans in Washington.  They are all just plain nuts.,1

Restitution should be 10 times the value of items taken  with a minimum of $1 000.00 half to victim and half to police so the cops will become interested.

3272,I hope that the talks are productive  but I can't say that I am particularly optimistic that they will be since Trump seems to have a hard time grasping reality.  The jobs he claims he wants to create just aren't coming back.  Nine out of ten jobs lost in the past couple of decades weren't exported to other countries  they were replaced by technology   like the tractor replaced farm laborers and the printing press replaced scribes.  Both economies can be grown by focusing on clean energy and technology. Education is the key to that. Hopefully Trudeau understands this and can convey that message.,0
3273,“We don’t  thank goodness  in Canada have one law for Omar Khadr and one law for all other Canadians ” Justice Belobaba told the courtroom in announcing his decision."  Ridiculous halo-polishing.  Khadr is a traitor to Canada  not a martyr.,1

3276,"So why do you think there are a million barrels of oil being shipped down the St. Lawrence every day?" ...  it's not just inbounds to montreal and quebec  it's also shipping along the great lakes and along the st lawrence seaway. In 2015 about 2 million tonnes of petroleum were shipped along the Montreal - lake ontario section and also 2 million tonnes or so along the seaway itself  which is not massive but it's a significant add on to the volume  http://www.greatlakes-seaway.com/en/pdf/traffic_report_2015_en.pdf    Again  hydrocarbon traffic in/out of eastern ports dwarfs anything we have out west. Nobody bats an eye  instead they point to the impeccable safety records of hydrocarbon transport and Newfie offshore oil. Good for them  bravo. Now  why can't we do the same?,0

3287,Imagine you have a tourist visa. You come & visit & go home  always lawfully.  CBP decides they don't like your pattern of travel. They take you to secondary for interrogation.  They ask you whether you own a home  a car in your country. Who is your employer? Imagine you live in a country where renting is the norm & no need to own a car because public transport works well. You are a freelancer or self employed.  CBP hears this as no assets  no ties and no job. You must be an intending immigrant. They revoke your visa ON THE SPOT. You are now here w/o legal papers. You ask to speak to your family  an attorney or your consul. You have no right to counsel. They strip search you. They take you to a federal jail.  After your gone  they call your consul but it's too late because you are gone. They DEPORT you the next day. You are banned for 5 years because they couldn't be bothered to get you an interpreter.  This is not an isolated incident.  I am an immigration attorney.,0

3298,My husband and I live in the Ebey's Landing National Historical Reserve. Yes  aircraft fly all directions over our house  including jets  helicopters  and reconnaissance planes. However  you might see and hear 3 jets in the morning or early afternoon  and 3 in the late afternoon or evening.  For the most part  by the time you hear the jets  they're already out of sight. However  it's doubtful the noise of the jet lasts more than 60 seconds. That means if 6 jets happen to pass over our house  and conversely EBay's Reserve  it comprises 6 minutes out of the 1 440 minutes in a day or around .42% of a 24-hour period.  Chances are  if a visitor saw a Navy jet pass overhead  they'd be thrilled. They're exciting to see  especially if they're wing-in-wing. If there's a health issue  it would be minuscule.  There at dozens of noises that last significantly longer and are more damaging  such as a jack-hammer  revved up car or truck speeding down Highway 20  hum of an ultra-light  etc.,0
3299,We differ on what is a public place.  A shower  bathroom  home are private places.  A public place in terms of dress is anywhere other people have to see and function and should not be burdened with odious projections of sexuality by simply looking around at their environment.

One person should not expect to partially enslave another by controlling their passive actions such as where they look.,0

3314,Exactly. When I left the GOP primary here in Fairbanks on March 1  I saw a LOT of people standing in that long line who I know usually vote Democrat. Why?  I've asked a few of them since and they all said they wanted to assure that Hillary would have an easy win.  But I think Trump may surprise them. I think the mood of this country's voters are such that they will reject an establishment insider Wall Street syphocant like Hillary. People want change and not the change that results in the middle class footing the bill for the indolent and the elite. People may still vote for Trump  but they don't need to. There's a third choice -- reject the two major parties that keep giving us idiots to run the country. I don't love Gary Johnson. The Libertarians could have chosen better. But he will do less harm to the country than either of the two idiots we know so well. And the change libertarianism would bring would perhaps save the country from economic and socio-political ruin.,1
3315,Clearly won?   Are you fucking insane?  He couldn't justify his reason for not responding to questions.

3318,Likely  family values is at most a constitutional right requiring the protester against the administrative restriction to prove clearly and convincingly that the govt has NO possible rational basis..anywhere... for its regulation.

3319,Long ago  a critic of the deep (and democratic) state of his day was charged with corrupting the minds of his fellow citizens. Admittedly  he had odd notions that ran contrary to the zeitgeist.

Alaska con not dictate policy on fish farming to the rest of the world. And the rest of the world thinks it is OK. So Alaska can get on board and be the biggest and best or be left behind. Which is where we are now. Eventually the commercial fishing permits for the open ocean will be as valuable as the West Virginia coal fields.,0

3356,I suggest an opposing congress would very likely offer more oversight than a same party congress simply due to bias.  Does Obama have the same oversight personnel? And even if they are the same  you surely agree that the same people do different things at different times  especially when the things they have oversight over (actions) are different. You got me to look this up. Consider this: "The House’s first act—de-clawing the Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE)—is a bad sign for congressional oversight and government accountability in the Trump era." That's removal of some oversight. A republican congress would seem to want to support their guy all they can: https://www.justsecurity.org/35922/congressional-oversight-trump-era-strategic-choices/  As far a bias in the RG editorial  it's an editorial.

For 7 years  Obamacare polled consistently in the red  week after week  month after month.  It moved barely into the black starting in January for one and only one obvious reason... fear of the unknown of what might replace it when Trump became prez and R's held onto Congress.  NOT because people actually like Obamacare.  Nothing changed with Obamacare to make it any better or different than the 7 years of consistent negative polling.  Most people still hate it  they're just more worried now about what might replace it (i.e. fear of the unknown).,0

3380,(cont.) 6) Americans value President Trump because he tries to keep his campaign promises regarding immigration  the military  Obamacare  and tax reform.  The dysfunctional Congress often makes his job impossible  but Americans do not "measure his success by howls."  7) Mexico and Canada are not run by fascist  racist totalitarian despots as NK is. The analogy is breathtakingly ignorant.  8) One of the tenets of fascism is autarky;  NK's Juche  system has made them somewhat independent of China.  9) Both NK and China are criminal regimes which depend upon money laundering  cybercrime  illegal weapons & drug sales human trafficking and slave labor for their economies.  Their relationship is one of criminal symbiosis.  As such China has no reason to control NK.  10) NK threatened to launch missiles close to Guam. President Trump's "Fire & Fury" remarks stopped them from doing so. The tone clearly was right  not "wrong."  11) China cannot enforce UN resolutions and sanctions with NK. (con,0
3381,I looked at the Forbes article itself.

Two recent surveys of meteorologists (summarized here and here) revealed similar skepticism of alarmist global warming claims."

Anyone who runs for office with "Down with the Elites" is either devious or delusional. Back in the 80's they were mostly Marxists  who  bless their idealist hearts  were delusional.

Assuming this large Philippine merchant vessel was in compliance with the laws of the sea  lights would have been clearly visible from all directions  meaning that even an early visual sighting would be almost certain by the frigate by either the spotters Port and Starboard  bridge crew or the officer on duty. Even if the merchant vessels lights were off  such a large ship would prominently be displayed on radar and would have been contacted and instructed to light the ship  change course and keep its distance from a US military vessel.

Not anymore. Trump has now run into a brick wall. It's called the FBI and the entire IC (Intelligence Community) who he mistakenly declared open warfare a few days into his presidency. Trump is now paying the price. After the ill-advised firing of FBI Director Comey  you can bet there are hundreds  maybe thousands  within the 26 000 strong FBI  now hell bent on bringing down the Trump House and his Mafia like family at ALL cost. These G Men are loyal to J Edgar Hoover's creation - the FBI. Not to mention the several intelligence agencies Trump has continuously disparaged at every opportunity. Add to this formidable mix  is Special Prosecutor Mueller and his 15 seasoned prosecutors sifting through all the evidence they can uncover. Trump and his consiglieris are in deep quicksand of trouble.,0

Where does China go to build stuff? China! They are using their own coal to depletion in 30 years or less  and are smart to use their existing capability to dominate the wind and solar industry to sell to others dependent on coal for power  which is most countries. It will have the added benefit of decreasing world coal demand  not that it matters much since they are half the world demand now.  And India has sufficient coal reserves for their own demand for a century. It's a laugh to think they're serious about goals currently.,0

3434,I really   really disagree with that statement.  There are absolutely not "more than ever" elk in Jellystone.   The Idaho FW Dept has wolf hunting because they lost almost all of the elk in east central Idaho.  The Northern Herd in Yellowstone was once 15-18 000 strong   with RMEF buying Dome Mountain for winter range and USFS providing the rest up Sixmile Creek and from Daly Lake north.  That herd is under 3000   and slowly getting to be fewer animals.  The Park is still overgrazed to rock   to where a rancher would lose his grazing allotment   but now due to bison which have expanded to graze on what the elk used to eat.   Grizzly bears in Montana are coming out of hibernation to find all the winter kill has been consumed by wolves   and there is little for them to eat to get an early nutrition boost before plants begin to grow.   You are drinking the wolf faerie kool aid.     And those Park wolves are now distributed throughout the West   including Oregon.,0

I don't understand how you are so quick to turn your back over the pledge but not a damn thing about all the pro athletes doing drugs  sexually assaulting girlfriends and wives and committing serious crimes when they are role models for our children. What kind of message is that? Imagine if the stands were empty because a player beat up his baby momma again or got arrested for DWI. Imagine the message that would send to our youth. I am a firm believer in the pledge & respecting our country. Look at the role models we have for our children. We pay billions for athletes and musicians but we don't have money for schools or medical care. And we wonder how things got so bad.,1

I see little difference between proponents of socialism/communism/nationalism and the ISIL monsters slaughtering "unbelievers" in the ME.  The current ANC leadership has created zero (in real terms) economic growth and that must mean that someone else is to blame - after all  how could the all-wonderful ANC be failing? Not only is that absolutely impossible  it cannot be allowed to be hinted at by anyone. We must all agree with anything the leadership comes up with else  we are racists!!!,1

3493,"Finding living wage jobs" is not just a struggle for the homeless  it's a struggle for a massive portion of American workers because we have become a society by and for the corporations.    Michael Moore's documentary "Where to Invade Next" provides a window into societies that put people first.  You will see nation's like Italy which provide each citizen with 8 weeks paid vacation and universal healthcare as a right. You will see nations like Germany which require that corporate boards have at least 50% worker representation which helps ensure fair wages and benefits. You will see nations like Norway which have humane public operated prison systems with low recidivism rates which are based on rehabilitation instead of revenge and punishment.  America has become a nation of mostly corporate slaves who have no idea what is actually possible and have set the bar very low for what is expected.,0

World leaders who foolishly accept the programming efforts of the corrupt media will get steam-rollered.  Trump is not "inane" or an idiot.

3508,The issue once again involved Hillary Clinton abusing her high office as Secretary of State in 2011  by personally attempting to pressure the Prime Minister of Bangladesh  on behalf of a donor to the Clinton Foundation.  The donor  Dr. Muhammed Yunus  had donated over $250 000 to the Clinton Global Initiative  and between $25 000 to $50 000 from another financial source.  The donations came from the Grameen Bank the country’s most famous micro-credit bank  and which Yunus was the chairman until he was removed.  And that’s when Hillary Clinton usurped her authority as Secretary of State and personally called Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina demanding that Dr. Muhammed Yunus be reinstated despite federal ethics laws that require government officials to recuse themselves from matters that could impact their spouse’s business.  Look it up. Clinton  personally  solicited favors and bribes.,0

Bottom line  I don't see how any of this will solve the many critical issues important to the average person such as affordable housing.,0

3513,You have to ask yourself this  Cat.....why would you pay $50.00 for a stock trading at that price when you can "buy it" / add to your holding for $47.50 to $49.00? Of course this is  (or should be) a moot point for someone who has no interest in but still comments on dividend investing. Whether a dividend invstor uses a regular drip  a synthetic one or allows cash dividends to accumulate to make periodic  opportunistic purchases is simply a personal decision. There is no right or wrong way to go about this. I happen to use a synthetic drip for registered (RRSP and TFSA) accounts as well as for non-registered accounts as it is the most convenient way for me to go. I periodically add cash to my portfolio from savings and use that new dollars for hopefully opportunistic purchases. If / when I retire  I'll turn off the drips or some of them.  But again  the type of drip particpation or not is purely a personal decision.,0

3525,That's a really good question. What we know is that this bombing of ours led to Assad to continue bombing and killing from the same airbase in order to show violent strength. This is the same pattern we have seen since the beginning of this violent civil war. It is crystal clear that this methodology has created enormous direct and "collateral damage" (over 300 000 killed  5 million refugees  7 mill. IDP's. I'm not sure how one can argue that this is "effective."  If everyone jumped in  it would create what is called a Nonviolent Moment  where there is a very clear difference between the side with violence/injustice and the more nonviolent side. As it did with Gandhi and the British at the Dharsana salt mines  this would put Assad and his supporters such as Russia in a situation where any additional violent attacks would seriously damage their moral legitimacy  perhaps to the point where not only would there be increased international pressure but also likely internal pressure.,0

3587,oldgit those small businesses need to invest in their business.  Maybe not that particular year so if you plow the money into RRSP's as you suggest or Morneau is suggesting you will be penalized for withdrawing RRSP's when you need to use that money for investment. When Gov't employees taxes go to pay for defined pensions for those business owners like the taxes do from the business owners go to pay for the defined pensions of Gov't employees then we can talk "fairness".,0

She then received hundreds of $millions in BRIBES right after the vote to her phony as it gets  "Charity"  which she never disbursed to Haiti.  She took in $Billions from all over the globe  from the Russians  and the Arabs.  That is why the Haitians all hate her and Bill.  They were used by the Clintons to make $Billions after the earthquake.  Russia gave Hillary over $145M  a few days after getting the rights to the uranium (Uranium 1 deal  25%+ of our uraniumm used to make nukes). Russia did not do the deal so that they would not get the uranium pal. Your dots don't line up.  Nobody is that stupid  except maybe the libtards.  And stop using Snopes for your "proof"  it is embarrassing.  Hillary Clinton took over $145M from the Russians.  And you are worried about Trump Jr listening to some shake down crazy woman?  LOL!,1

"Third  the GET effectively taxes ***all to pay for a good which primarily benefits only some within the City and County of Honolulu***. . .There are valid arguments against taxing the residents of Kauai for a rail they can’t ride. ***Similar arguments for those on the Windward side of Oahu***"  My counterfactuals are not endless; I provide three–the "present housing crisis  deferred maintenance for existing infrastructure  and lingering concerns for the state pension fund." If you can not make an argument for prioritizing rail over only three pressing issues  I would not trust you with $2B in taxpayer dollars.,0
3623,In a Canadian context the internet 'infrastructure' companies could be considered to be analogous to common carriers.

Also he is skeptical about the use of American military in all the wars of adventure we have been having which by and large Hillary seems to support.,1

3665,Most students are probably aware of these options. But guidence counselors should be able to provide specifics about apprenticeship programs  other training options  and  with aptitude tests  steer students to where they are likely to succeed. This is far better than saddling students with thousands of dollars in college debt  for a clerical or fast food industry position. Besides  we do need a skilled labor pool.,0
3666,Black Lives Matter is hypnotically dramatizing George Owell's story  "1984".

Both Antifa and BLM have done so by trying to harm people who want to speak.  Pathetic.,1

3679,A subject of investigation? Does that now mean the person is guilty or something? To me investigating means there is no proof and it could mean that person might have some information the could answer questions about someone or something else.   "It is all now a matter of evidence". I thought it was always a matter of evidence. Are you suggesting all these entities know who the guilty party is  they just don't have any evidence yet? I am not sure things should work that way. Innocent until PROVEN guilty.,0

3684,Oh  Trump is all about isolationism (whether it be climate change  visitor's visas  immigration  or trade agreements). In this particular case we throw away tremendous leverage on a number of issues for what? To create a vacuum for China to fill; of course TPP is meaningless without USA and alternatives will emerge. Friedman points out that China will benefit. And what benefit or leverage do we get in return? Nothing. We are isolated right now in the World arena. I think we are all understanding why Donald Trump has been in bankruptcy many time is his life  and I believe the end result of TPP withdrawal (and his other juvenile decisions) will be something very close to bankruptcy  for our country.,0

3691,I am not a pilot but like many I fly regularly and this certainly caught my eye. It seems to me to be essentially a cost-saving measure  just one of the many legacies of the Harper government that are now coming to light. God knows what else is coming down the pipeline (which has now become a fraught word in Canadian politics).  Is it the right thing to do? As a consumer and citizen  I'd like to know why Canada is leading the way with this change and what other jurisdictions have to say about it. Why not ask our newly-minted Senators to call public hearings and let the stakeholders thrash this out in public. The Trudeau government could kick things off by making public the Treasury Board submission that justified this decision in the first place. We might even be able to ask Tory leadership hopefuls where they stand on this issue.,0

3694,Oldpoet: An old friend of mine who was the editor of a Riverside  California paper always answered petty complaints regarding spelling and grammatical errors with the comment "you should see how they spell "shirt".....  Of course we should try to use correct grammar and spelling.  They contribute to clarity.  Additionally  misspellings and grammatical errors give individuals who disagree with the content of your message a basis for "cheap shot" attacks on the message.    Usually those mistakes don't really alter the meaning of your message  but it's nice to avoid them.  So be careful how you spell "shirt."  regards  Gary,0

3697,Motley  thanks. Exactly my point. It's just math until somebody ignores the math and spouts the talking points instead. Such as the "death tax" baloney and the idea that our too-low inheritance tax is a damper on the incentives of succeeding in business. Those assertions are both talking points  basically the way-too-successful information strategy of repeating lies often enough that the lemmings take them as truth.,0
3698,Funny that we didn't have any of this pathetic destroy history behavior going on when Obama was in office? Why is that? History is just that  so leave it in the past. If 165 year old historical events are only now starting to trouble and offend you  then you are a special kind of stupid! I find it ironic that every time Democrats lose a major election  they act like sore losers and selfish children by finding some new mantra (or several) to push to their ignorant base!,1

3700,The history of this state began about 15 000 years ago  according to current evidence.  All but the last millimeter or two of that long timeline belongs to Native peoples--who didn't subscribe to your Boys' Life myth about "rugged individualists hacking a life out of the wilderness."  Traditional Native communities believed (and to some extent still believe today) that survival is a shared enterprise.  A man was proud to share his good fortune with the group; equally  a man stayed with his group during hard times.  He didn't run off and take care of his own ass while they suffered.  You whites may do it differently  but I can't see that you've got much to brag about.  Your budget deficit  after all  was made by your own stupid and greedy every-man-for-himself white politics  not according to Native values.,1

3710,SOR  good point!  When I first started teaching 40+ years ago (now retired)  students were grouped homogeneously in the core subjects like English  Science and Social Studies.  Homogeneous grouping simply means by ability.  A decade or so later  like many educational policies  the pendulum swung in favor of HETEROGENEOUS grouping where students of any ability are placed in a classroom.  The theory there is that the "good" students will be like role models for the poor students  and that they will help the poor students achieve.  Hard to believe  but that was and still is the trend.  My department included 15 people  and when we voted  the final vote was 13-2 in favor of hetero.  Just me and another teacher voted NO.  I transferred to another position.,0

3719,I agree about the bankruptcies and the negotiated reductions. These were in most cases a direct result of employers not paying into retirement accounts of employees as they had promised. Often legislatures and governmental agencies were complicit in this. We know of states and municipalities and unions that were committing fraud and essentially outright theft against employees. But I don't know where there has been such a sustained legislative and (mostly business supported) propaganda attack against public employees over such a long period of time. Blaming public employees for budget deficits that have nothing to do with them  holding up the football coaches and cancer researchers as representative of a scandal involving employees as a whole  ignoring the fact that benefits have been radically reduced while the corporate tax burden has fallen dramatically  obscuring the fact that retirements for most employeesare quite modest--this is part of a coordinated attack on public employees.,0

3726,The point of it all is that culture differences are the prime factor for separatist feelings.   Look at Canada: you can split money as much as you want. But you cannot split symbolic things. The major qualms between the ROC and Quebec are all symbolic.    Alberta can complain all it wants about "equalization"   unfair representation in the HoC or the Senate  but in the end it is unlikely to develop a strong separatist movement because it is too similar to its neighbours. People do not like it? They can move to Manitoba.  Quebec on the other hand is sufficiently distinct to generate a separatist movement irrespective of money. A Quebecker cannot move to Alberta and feel that it is exactly the same country. Language  and laws are different.  Were the Americans poorer than the British when they separated? What was their point?  PS Spain mishandled this in a major way. We are lucky that our Supreme Court acted with sophistication. Neither Chretien nor Parizeau could be trusted.,0

3728,"No  in 1991  the people of Crimea  along with a majority of the other people of Ukraine  voted to leave the USSR and form an independent Ukrainian nation." You can't help showing your ignorance of history  can you  TDM? There were multiple referendums in 1991 in the former Ukrainian region. One in January was as I said: "In 1991  Crimea voted 94.3% in favour to leave Ukraine and become an autonomous republic of the USSR." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_sovereignty_referendum _1991 It was only because the USSR then dissolved that Crimea defaulted on that referendum's outcome and instead became an autonomous region within Ukraine.

3741,http://alaska.conocophillips.com/Documents/COPA_New_Projects_Fact_Sheet_Nov_2013_FINAL.pdf  This is a previous similar lie from what I recall of the claim this rig was ordered "because" of the passage of SB21.  The Kuparuk rig was ordered prior to the passage of SB21.     All of this was on the books and in the plans prior to SB21 being passed.   "Since oil tax reform was passed in April  ConocoPhillips Alaska (COPA) has announced plans to increase its investments on Alaska’s North Slope.  The new plans consist of: • bringing an additional rig to the Kuparuk field;  • constructing a new drill site on the southwest flank of the Kuparuk River Field (Drill Site 2S); and  • progressing the Greater Mooses Tooth #1 development in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (NPR-A)."  Taxes are not a main determinant of a project`s sanction. The market and VOLUME is what matters and the profit to be made.

"Experts still have a long way to go to connect the dots between fructose and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease  obesity  diabetes  and heart disease. Higher intakes of fructose are associated with these conditions  but clinical trials have yet to show that it causes them." . Hmmm. No connections. No proof. No science to base your opinions upon. .

3750,Aside from the question of whether or not this apology and payment are just  the scenario in which Christopher Speer was killed was a war scenario. If Christopher Speer had killed Omar Khadr  it would have been deemed an act of war committed by a soldier  and would have been celebrated as such. The reverse killing was considered an act of murder committed by a terrorist. This makes no sense. The Americans were simply making up rules  on the fly  that suited them.

3760,Scientists would eventually learn that cannabinoid receptor signalling---endogenously  herbally (with MJ!)  or synthetically---also regulates adult neurogenesis (brain cell growth) and stem cell migration [Dr. J. McPartland  "The Endocannabinoid System: An Osteopathic Perspective" Journal of the American Osteopathic Association 108(10)  2008] (214  Smoke Signals by Martin A. Lee).  A major function of the endocannabinoid system---and therefore a significant effect of the cannabinoids in MJ---is neuroprotective in nature: protecting brain cells from too much excitation. Thus  the endocannabinoid system is part of the body's general protective network  working in conjunction with the immune system and various other pathological systems [R. Mechoulam et al.  "Cannabinoids and Brain Injury: Therapuetic Implications" TRENDS in Molecular Medicine 8(2)  2002].,0

Why not give Bombardier another $400 000 000 so they can build a flood protection system which works as well as their Mexican made streetcars.

3790,I'm surprised that people have already forgotten the 2016 US presidential campaign.  Donald Trump did not become president because of the Republican party. He became president in spite of the Republican party. In fact  he nearly destroyed the national Republican party in the process. The Republican party has not changed  and there is no reason to expect Trump to be much help for Republican candidates  because the people who put Trump in the White House don't necessarily like Republicans.  In Virginia  in the days before the election  Democrat Ralph Northam was going easy on Trump  running a TV commercial with the message that he would work with Trump where he agreed with him and oppose Trump where he did not agree with him. That suggests a view that Northam saw Trump as continuing to be popular enough in Virginia that Northam didn't want to alienate Trump voters  and that may explain why Northam did better against Gillespie than Clinton did against Trump in Virginia.,0

So the hypocrites are  you Ms. Albert  and the media  because you've supported and defended this behavior by men.,1
3803,Premiums paid under COBRA are what the employer was paying to the insurer  including the employee's contribution. For most  of course  that will be much more than what you saw deducted from your paycheck each month. There's also a small (2%) service charge.  For example  when I became self-employed in 2006  I started paying $1349 per month for my family's coverage: $1339 for the policy plus a $10 service charge. Before that  I saw $232 deducted from my pay each month for exactly the same policy. My employer was paying the remaining $1107 every month.  Today  we have coverage through my wife's employer. For "family" (employee + spouse + children) coverage  the total monthly premium is $1926. Our contribution is $850 and the employer pays $1076. The employer's benefits summary lists a "COBRA Rate" of $1965 for that policy. The $1926 premium plus a 2% service charge.  For the same plan  employee  only  the COBRA rate is $680. Frosty's $720 sounds reasonable.,0
3804,Sure  install the app and save 10% now and then get shafted when they use something on it against you in the future and end up paying double what you've saved.

It's a basic of modern politics  one that has depressed so many voters that they shy away from either party in disgust.   I'm one of them.    While registration has changed some this year  independent voter registration has by far the greatest gains in registration.  http://www.people-press.org/topics/political-party-affiliation/,0

3867,I didn't say murder  attempted or not  is good. I was saying that them being arrested is. Which they were  so I define that a good thing versus them running around town free. Are you suggesting that it's not a good thing that the alleged murderer was arrested along with a potential accomplice? If so then I'd greatly diagree with you  without shame and would fervently defend my position. I don't care whether you or anyone like that or not  but I welcome the debate. Other things could be  well let's see....other....things. You don't know every possible thing that will happen anywhere  at any given time and by any one  neither do I. That comment was to say that I leave room in my judgement for the possibility of good things that could happen. Yes  I know I'm tedious  thanks for noticing  it serves me well and sometimes even others  if they're willing to consider possibilities other than their own close-minded opinions. You have no say in determining my judgement  but that's cute.,0

Actors  overly paid though they are   serve to entertain us in movies or TV shows  nothing more.  The Golden Globes and the Oscars are nothing but self-glorifaction annual events  a two hour meat market  to quote George C. Scott.

3874,One thing to bear in mind in the debate over church and state is that Canada is not 'Murica.  America was established with the idea of separation of church and state clearly entrenched in the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  It is based on the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution which declares that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion  or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.”   Thomas Jefferson promoted the idea of such separation and in 1947  U.S. Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black quoted Jefferson in his majority opinion for Everson v. Board of Education declaring that “the clause against establishment of religion by law was intended to erect ‘a wall of separation between Church and State.'”  Many Canadians erroneously believe that separation of church and state is guaranteed in the Canadian Constitution. When  in fact  Canada constitutionally accommodates religion in ways that would never be accepted in the United States.,0
3875,Having read multiple posts by you both here and on Disquus where you have either advocated or threatened violence against those who disagree with one of your pet beliefs  your assertion of 'humor' is not credible.

3879,Lawyers typically don't buy HOA liens.  It's investors that do that.  And in Colorado  there is a specific process that must be followed before an association can foreclose on its lien  including the opportunity to appear before the board  to enter into a payment plan  and to challenge the lien at a court hearing.  Then  a homeowner must be delinquent by at least the amount of 6-months' regular assessments before an association can begin foreclosure proceedings.,0

3881,"To be eligible for Canadian citizenship  you must have been physically present in Canada as a permanent resident for at least 1 460 days (4 years) in the six years immediately before the date of your application" Sounds simple except the CBSA makes no record of exit. We have no idea who is here or somewhere else. The RCMP investigate numerous fraudulent citizenship applications and citizenship grants supported by fraudulent documents. It's almost an industry run by immigration "consultants". The system is as full of holes as swiss cheese.,0

3886,The partial answer is to reduce GOVERNMENT Spending.,0
3887,"and the money comes from federal taxes paid by Albertans"  No  Bill  the money comes from federal taxes paid by Canadians.  All of them.  And corporate taxes by Canadian firms.  All of them.  Since the biggest number of each of these is in Ontario  the biggest input to federal resources comes from there  and then each province in turn by population.  ...And yes  just to pick an example  the Government of Canada doesn't pay to have any naval bases in Alberta.  So  there's a net outflow to pay for those naval bases.  What's your point:  is it that Albertans shouldn't pay federal taxes like all the rest of us?  I have a lot of respect for Alberta  and Albertans in general  but I don't respect people who misrepresent how fiscal federalism works  or people who grouse about a short-term deficit while having the lowest tax rates in Confederation.  This is called arguing on facts  not "hating Alberta.",0

3890,And the counter-productive utopian description of Canada by the American left continues onward.  Our health care system ranks below America  and we have bottomed out in comparison to almost all other G-20 nations  and we have very high infant mortality rates.  Even civil servants in forums and seminars admit there are more problems than successes right now.  This is like Michael Moore's "Bowling For Columbine."  Poverty and violence in Canada  what's that?   You won't go bankrupt in Canada if you are poor and sick  but you will wait 6 months to a year just through the testing period  while waiting for procedures is an even longer stress case.

While both candidates presented themselves well it was quite clear that neither candidate had a clear understanding of the process by which Poulsbo government is administered. Never having attended a single council meeting as one candidate admitted and the other attending only two recent meetings points up the need for more citizen involvement in addressing the many issues confronting Poulsbo and its rapid growth issues. We applaud both candidates for stepping forward willing to take on the task and trust that should either of them be elected they will quickley undertake a crash course in Poulsbo city government and the state powers under which the city operates.,0
3900,You right wingers are crazy.  Fox News and talk radio spew the fake news as did Trump with his lies about everyone and everything.  His lies for years about Obama appealed to the many racists and haters in this country.  Bernstein and Woodward are heroes  they found the truth and people like you idiots don't want to know the truth and can't handle it either.  You want to live in your stupid ass gun nut world.  Trump insulted his way to the nomination and he and his followers are traitors to win an election with help from our enemy  Putin and his evil cronies.  Not only is there is nothing admirable about the blowhard narcissist Trump  there is not even anything redeeming about him as he sneers  chants  hangs around with mafia  thugs like Kelly and Manafort and even brings in his family to  his dirty deeds.  Trump has always been about power and greed  not helping anyone or this country.  He views the Presidency as a way to build his empire and to feed his sick ego.,1

I've followed this story as it has developed and have read the available accounts of Ms. Shurtz's background....including comments from former students.  I think the real test now is of the willingness of those insulted and offended by her actions to find forgiveness.  I  for one  hope they can..... Ms Shurtz has paid a tremendous professional and personal price for her mistake...and  yes  I'm convinced it was a serious error in judgment  not a malicious act.  I think  at this point  some of that forgiveness would benefit everyone.,0

3911,Actually family farms have been mostly "gobbled up" by neighbors  or by someone in the same general area who's looking to expand. A big part of that is that the standard of living that a small farm will support was considered just fine back in the 60s and 70s  but won't cut it with young families today. That applies to farm families the same as everyone else. I wouldn't trade growing up on a small farm for anything  but what we regarded as a good middle-class living would be viewed much differently today.,0

3919,I agree with your comment  but have to disagree that "AA is not a religious group".  The NY Court of Appeals decision (quite widely quoted) was that AA is a religious group because the AA program is based on a published manual and the experience is repeatable.  That is  AA is always the same  regardless of location.  i.e. it is a religion  not a cult.,0
3920,As much as I support  a burqa ban  it is a misconception that one does not already have to remove the face covering for purposes of identification  i.e. to match the person to an ID card. That is not the purpose of the law.  This goes beyond that  it requires to have the face uncovered not just so you can be matched to some ID card  but for the whole time one is  interacting with the person giving the services  e.g. a male clerk or nurse  bus driver  etc. It is about face-to-face interaction in dealing with other people  not strictly ID matching.,0

3931,Most of the alleged white middle class grievances seem to be about trade  industrial policy  taxes and immigration. To a lesser extent war.  Many of those may in fact be insoluble  but none of them involve reducing or resisting the equality of any other Americans  rhetoric aside. Free trade and globalization have not notably benefited African Americans  for example.  Even the most extreme of immigration measures would  by definition  neither harm any Americans nor reduce their equality. The only privilege defended would be of citizens against non-citizens  and only illegally resident ones at that. This is a legitimate function of sovereignty and of democracy in a country that claims to be both.  Equality and privilege are meaningless buzzwords in this context.,0
3932,Looking at the original study and maps I can't help but wonder how much of the problem of income mobility is tied to the persistent poverty among a large portion of our native population.  We know  from various other studies and statistics  that indigenous people  particularly those living on reserves  tend to have much higher rates of poverty than non-indigenous people in Canada  and they have for many generations.  If you have a region with a lot of indigenous people living in poverty from generation to generation then income mobility is going to be reduced in that area.  If that really is one factor behind this than any solution would need to be targeted rather than a more general attempt to "fix" the problem at a national level.,0

3946,Most of China's political leaders are scientists or engineers by training. Xi Jinping studied chemical engineering  former President Hu Jintao was a hydraulic engineer and former Prime Minster Wen Jiabao studied geological engineering. It's estimated that 80% of China's top political leaders are engineers or scientists. This is why China is run by technocrats who tend to be cautious and deliberate.  If the Chinese leadership is convinced that climate change is real  then they will look at it as a problem to be solved from an engineering viewpoint. Shut down coal plants  build solar panels by the millions and new nuclear power plants. It's also likely they believe they are investing in the new industry to grow the economy.,0

French is inescapable. How could anyone see it otherwise unless  of course  certain politicians are fear mongering over it? I'm bilingual; worked real hard to learn French when I got here at the age of 59. Other newcomers make that same effort  unless they are already francophone--which most are.  This is a very francophone province.,0

3952,From reporting on Harvey  I'd say Harvey response by far topped Katrina's response.  I was a 1st responder to Katrina in NOLA.  FEMA barred search and rescue efforts for days after the hurricane left.  Federal  state & local law enforcement agencies of the SE states were ready to respond before the hurricane hit & started towards or were already in NOLA the day after it hit. LEOs from around the country were also on their way.  FEMA immediately put out a stand down order to all federal law enforcement until FEMA decided it was safe to enter NOLA.  FEMA also claimed that those LEOs from the gulf states don't know the immediate needs of persons/cities that were hit by hurricanes.  DUH!  Our purpose Was search  rescue & to make the city safe.  NOPD had very few officers left to aid in this effort due to being stranded  killed  or just fled the city in the midst of the damage and chaos. & who knows more about the needs of hurricane victims than those who survived numerous of them.,0

They wrote reports stating as such  which the Bush administration then used as "evidence" justifying their invasion of Iraq.  Did the Bush administration lean on those intelligence agencies to come up with those reports? Almost certainly. And it's that political influence in what intelligence agencies reveal that makes their reports something the public should ALWAYS take with a tablespoon of salt.   Security agencies work for the government  not for the people. When a security agency reveals something  you're not hearing what the security agency wants you to know- you're hearing what the government of the day wants you to know.,0

3982,Switzerland has true democracy.  Their parliament doesn't run in the red and they don't send their youths off to unnecessary wars.  Their representatives are public servants  instead of public enemies.  Their country is sustainable  not going to the dogs.  The Founders decided to stick with the tried and bogus -- anything but democracy.  Whence  our Rube-Goldberg government.  Isn't it time to give rubes a chance?  Do we have to suffer collapse before thinking maybe we're on the wrong track?  It's a pity to have to suffer from mistakes.,0
3983,Wow!  I had no clue before you enlightened me that 7 year olds could earn an honours degree in economics from one of the top five business schools in the USA.    Our glorious leader The Boy Blunder flunked out of two science degree programs and was only able to earn a simple BA in the easiest major going (English) plus a teachers certificate.  This  according to you  is way beyond an economics degree with honours from  a world class university which  according to you  is beneath the capability of a seven year old.  Either this is an extraordinary revelation for us all or you are another moronic Trudeau troll.,1

Not once during the weekend did he even think it would mean a lot to the victims families and the nation to condemn the attacks and offer support? It probably took some thing like the letter from one of the victims mother or somebody close to him to finally tell him he should say something.   I have had many issues with prior presidents  but I honestly believe Obama  Bush  Clinton  Bush Sr  Reagan  etc would have said something in a very timely manner and not some stupid random tweet that not everybody in the nations will see.   Maybe he was convinced it was fake news and the evil media who created the story. Since he felt that was more important to tweet about.,1

3994,It has almost become a regular cycle.  We get eight years with a Republican administration where they blow all the efforts of the previous Democrat administration out of the fiscal water.  IIRC  Clinton actually had a positive surplus on the budget only to have Dubya come along throw all fiscal restraints out the window spoil it.  Then Obama had to pick up the pieces and now with the Trump administration out goes any sense of fiscal responsibility again.  It doesn't help any that the Trump administration is borrowing from the Reagan administration's voodoo economics to justify unnecessary  if not unwise if Gov. Brown's experiment is any indicator  tax cuts to the wealthy and already low taxed corporations.,0

3998,Canadians killed by Islamic extremists? The immediate result should be Canada cleaning up the Islamic world from one end to the other so that there are no more terrorists to be found in it  nor any more people who discriminate against members of non-Muslim minorities  nor anyone who prepares for war against Israel.  Those of the Muslim faith who are willing to live in peace  on the other hand  will now be able to do so.  That will send the right message: Don't mess with Canadians. Ever.,1

4008,This paper is stunningly selective about who it will report about  as it chooses its narrative about the USA.   Here are names not reported in this paper: Debra Clayton and Edward Andersson. Both cops have been in the news in America  both shot in recent days. The Globe and Mail has ignored them.   Those two cops SHOULD be on posters for what the G&M has been pushing for in its US reporting in recent years. Both cops were reputed to be caring cops who would not use violent force as their first response against a suspect. Officer Clayton faced a black suspect at Walmart a couple days ago. The cop  a mother of two  was promptly slaughtered by the suspect  who wore body armor and kept shooting into her body after she collapsed. Andersson  a male cop  was shot twice helping out at an apparent road rage scene. The shooter then busied himself ramming the unconscious cop's bloody head into the pavement.   Why the silence  G&M?

4015,Too lazy to JFGI Lazeelink? Or were you afraid of encountering Inconvenient Truths?  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2741520/  If avoiding home mortgage foreclosure were that easy there would not have been a subprime mortgage crisis in the USA.  "Foreclosure affects already-vulnerable populations  including many people living below the federal poverty level and many families with children living at home. There is reason to be concerned that foreclosure may exacerbate current disparities in health. Many of our participants cited poor health as the primary cause of their foreclosure; nearly a quarter had high medical bills and owed money to medical creditors. Medical conditions and bills may worsen the emotional and financial stress faced by households undergoing mortgage foreclosure  and this increased stress may in turn exacerbate ill health (and may discourage people from obtaining further necessary medical care).",0

4080,What growth? Growth fuelled by social welfare for new immigrants from tax dollars is what they want. GDP per capita has been  and is  declining = middle to low income earners (the majority) are all making less (income) and paying more (taxes/COLA). This is directly correlated with the substantial increase in immigration in the early 90's. Therefore  we have over two decades of economic statistics that show high immigration levels are directly correlated with worsening economics for middle to lower income earners (the majority). Also directly correlated with widening income gap  where the very wealthy get even wealthier.  With 6.5 million youth entering the job market in the next decade and only 5 million boomers who may (not will) retire and reduce consumption  there is already labour oversupply coming. After that decade  demographics start to balance again UNLESS you want vast labour oversupply to depress wages and human rights - then you propose high immigration levels.,0

Regarding yourself I do challenge many of your claims  not so much for what you say but how nastily you say it.  I hope your son is able to adjust to his environment.,0
4109,Beautiful!  One of the most creative columns ever.,0
4110,I would agree at this point in the season that is how the situation looks BUT at the same time  the season is only half over! If it were that decisive then the Playoff Selection Committee would choose the Final Four right now.  I am going to bet all the remaining unbeaten teams will not remain that way by the end of the season. Plus  and I while I do not think you meant it that way  are you suggesting by your comment that once there are only 1 or 2 unbeaten teams remaining in the Pac-12  the other teams should just quit against them in order to make sure they stay unbeaten in order to be considered for the playoffs?!  Personally  I am not sure what to make of the Pac-12...great depth or no team able to "drive it home." WSU looks unbeatable and then does not even score a TD against Cal? Cal looked slow against Oregon; Oregon looked slow against WSU; WSU looked slow against Cal! We will see!,0

4119,"Democrats are brighter than Republicans."? Amid the contents of 1000's of e-mails released by  Wiki Leaks  D.C. Leaks and Guccifer 2.0 directly attributed to the authorship of Democrats  I'd say Forrest Gump's famous quote: 'Stupid is as Stupid does" is an extremely charitable description of the Democrat party. Reasonable and knowledgeable individuals capable of objectively discerning the contents of those e-mails will most likely conclude democrats have a very serious mental disconnect that far exceeds blatant ignorance.  The point  is established by example in the absurdly ridiculous claim  that "only a woman who is either an ***-kisser  a prostitute  or a resolute gold digger". My intellectual  instinct tells me that neither Melania Trump   Ivanka Trump or Tiffany Trump fit such a description. A description which portrays anyone as being on the same juvenile level as Trump's indefensible comments about women.,1
4120,Don't mind your post because you're nuts and you really need the outlet.,1

4122,"The coarseness of this election was  in part  a result of people being called ignorant  racist  nazi  etc. for questioning liberal orthodoxy."  Wrong again  Larry. People were called ignorant for being ignorant  and spreading false information taken from alt right websites without ever considering fact checking before parroting. (They should be called alt wrong websites.)  People were called racist for making racist comments  which of course were simply considered anti PC remarks by the racists. That's the racist way of being PC  ironic as that is  and it kind of brings us back to the ignorance thing  again.  Calling someone a Nazi who has ideals that align perfectly with Nazi ideals is simply a reflection on that persons belief systems.  The remainder of your comment is too inane to even discuss  which once again brings us back to the whole ignorance thing  again  Larry.,1

The valley at Site C is already completely transformed (google it)- stopping now would make the NDP's fast ferries fiasco seem like a walk in the park. Horgan made a pact with a group of career activists who are siding with US-funded protesters threatening "direct action" against BC's infrastructure - it's pathetic. The greens are a joke and the NDP is the same party that was reduced to an impressive two seats 16 years ago - it won't take long to find out why. Look at all the free stuff  raises for unions  no tolls  more welfare  cheaper ferries  $10/day childcare  $15/hr minimum wage  and higher taxes and red tape for the private sector... all economic winners!

4141,Am I the only one tired of endless crying from Trump supporters about the “biased media” which is “so unfair” to their beloved orange one? Trying to create their own false narrative while sniveling that the world owes them and Mr.trump respect. FACTS published in his own words with supporting videos being reported which paint him as greedy  selfish  incompetent with zero regards for anyone but himself. “Poor  poor me!” He’s a president of the US with authoritarian impulses.

4156,Actually  Alaska was Democrat first. Our governor was William Egan. Our Senator was Ernest Gruening. Then the oil boom hit and we got all those conservatives. Perhaps the PFD might have something to do with it?,0
4157,Seriously Canada! We have to set a higher bar for evaluating our healthcare system. In the March 10th Globe editorial there is clear gloating about the relative performance of the Canadian healthcare system when compared to our southern neighbours. Is it really productive to make comparisons to the US healthcare system? The US system  at least the traditional private fee-for-service component  is staggeringly dysfunctional. We should be comparing our system to the British National Health Service (NHS). According to the latest (2014) Commonwealth Fund report the NHS was the #1 rated system among those studied (Canada was 10th of 11  and yes the US was dead last). Perhaps more impressive  the British system was 32% less expensive per capita than Canada's system. The NHS achieves these results by having a coordinated system that focuses on the specific needs of the population and employing all healthcare providers  including physicians  in team-oriented models.,0

4160,Honestly for probably 90% of respondents 60 seconds is probably all it should take to approve or decline a mortgage.  For the most part it is a pretty simple bit of looking up your credit rating  outstanding debt  assets and income then a handful of calculations.  Of course if you read the fine print you'll see something like the following:  "[Mortgage prequalifying tool]  gives you an estimate of the amount of mortgage you may qualify for with us based on the accuracy and completeness of the information provided by you  is for illustrative and general information purposes only and is not intended to provide specific financial or other advice."  (Source: RBC's 60-second pre-approval page).,0
4161,In my view there are certain large parts of the things we Alaskans have that are not dependent upon fluctuation in the economy. For example DOT has thousands of miles of roads throughout the state that require various levels of maintenance  plowing and  sanding.  I consider the ferry system as a needed as roads.  The cost associated with these change minimally with the price of oil.  Likewise there are airports in communities all around the state that require similar maintenance.  Law enforcement and the judicial system and incarceration require somewhat static funding levels.  Education funding may have some ability to change with decrease of school enrollments but the overall amount  for most schools systems is not going to change when a school enrollment changes by a student or two in a village setting.    As I see it the budget issue is not due the aforementioned programs.  It is all those special things the legislature has funded in local communities to win votes.,0

I thought estimates varied but some put 45's travel to his private club in Florida at 20M in his first 80 days  putting him on pace to spend more on travel in his first year than BO did in 8 years.  In other words if he keeps this going to his resorts every wknd  one term could cost taxpayers ~400M.  BO's 8 years cost ~97M.  Last month the secret service had used up their entire budget for the year for him and his 41 other protectees  including his sons who flit around the globe doing his personal business.

It is not about disrespecting the flag but rather disrespecting those who bled and died so that you can "take a knee".  It may be directed at government officials but it is perceived as a slap in the face by many of those who serve.  If you want to protest politics pick a better venue  one where you don't inadvertently offend those who serve.,0

4224,Total federal debt was approximately 5 trillion in 2001  about 10 trillion in 2009  now it is 19 trillion. Obama still has over 5 months to go and a very good chance at the debt hitting 20 trillion. While he has in fact doubled the debt  he had help. During his first two years  the democrats controlled both houses of congress. Because of that and democrat control of the Senate until Jan. 2015  the debt grew slower but still grew far too fast.  The roots of ISIS are Al Qaeda. The roots of Al Qaeda began in Afghanistan during the soviet occupation. A long time before 2004. A much more militant faction of Al Qaeda moved into Northern Syria sometime in the mid 2000's. After Obama unwisely pulled troops out of Iraq  refusing to continue to negotiate a status of forces agreement with Iraq  the faction in Syria  dealing with Syrian military brutality and excesses  became even more radicalized and militant becoming ISIS.,0
4225,More than anything else  these statues of CSA soldiers and politicians are nothing less than monuments to treason.  Treason should never be celebrated with a statues or a monument.

When communism fell  they took all the communist statues and monuments out into the country and put them on display in a history park with explanations that those statues and monuments represented a very dark time in history.

4249,An income tax  old Alaskan style  would be intrusion enough but the paperwork required was (yes  I remember doing it) was minimal and there was no need for anyone of even average intelligence to pay an expensive "preparer".  But what we see now is incredibly intrusive  exceedingly complicated and most people will have to pay a professional to figure out what they owe.  So  in that sense  it's a "jobs" bill.  Whoopie!  We get to pay an unnecessary tax AND pay someone to figure out how much we have to fork over.  But  wait  it's so complicated that a gigantic state bureaucracy with lots of political plum jobs to be doled out.  Last estimate I heard was at least 80.  Of course there'll have to be a budget for those new cronies so perhaps the percentage amount being bandied about will have to be doubled to pay their wages  health insurance  overtime  training and  of course a lot of travel expenses to attend courses and seminars on how to shake people down efficiently.,0

4256,Wow! What a stupid lox of horse crap from a few strange folks...I would suggest someone relook at the exit polls...middle income white males voted for little d in large enough numbers...but as is most often the case  the righteous right won because of voter suppression. Fewer voters by percentage came out and this translates to the win...if all the likely voters had shown up instead of being depressed she would have won. But this didn't happen so if you voted for him then 'you own it 'cause you broke it.' I wish us all luck and will hold my breath that we can put the breaks on stupidity.,1

4262,What Trump is doing...and few in here realize it except those who voted for him  ....is he is controlling the media via his tweets.  He is still doing it.  TRUMP got over $2B in free advertising leading up to the election.  That squeezed out all of the morons like Lindsey Graham  Hillary  Jeb  Marco  Ted Cruz....all of them.  Everybody was watching Trump.  The idiotic left hasn't figured it out yet.  He keeps tweeting  they over react  and he is proved right once again  and gets to command the entire news cycle on every show.  He loves doing this  and this is payback for that media dinner in 2011 when Obama made fun of him for 5 minutes up there.  Trump is letting the morons on the left spit  go nuts  throw tantrums  sceam  riot  you name it....he is letting them squeal big time! lol!!  Old sour puss klastri in here is one of them.  He needs a mega-papaya enema.  He is all backed up and is full of it and it makes him crabby!!,1
4263,When the permanent fund was established  the statute prohibited the legislature from appropriating any of the principle of the fund but "permits use of the fund’s earnings for general governmental purposes."

4269,I was very disappointed that I couldn't go to TG's town hall meeting because it was at noon and I  like most people  was working. I didn't get a response from BS's team even though I emailed and called. It is critical that our representatives share their priorities and intentions with us and we with them. It is disheartening that I have stepped up the amount of time I am engaged in the political arena (calling DC multiple times a day) but my interest and support is not acknowledged or encouraged. It must be discouraging for young people who are becoming more engaged.  Check out this webinar/call on Sunday afternoons for information and encouragement https://act.moveon.org/survey/readytoresist5/   and this google doc that has most of the phone numbers you will need and which side if some important issues these people are on https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hSGjyWJZIQJpGz4V2ftX_qioCgBtL59oJkkhx146nFE/htmlview?sle=true#gid=0    Once you get the numbers in your phone - it's easy!,0

4286,Ms. Kneeland  for every law there is a proper venue (which  considering you are the legal counsel for those in support of the initiatives - you likely know as well as any) and the county level is not the proper venue for state-level issues. If citizens want to "correct a biased system" as you say  they would be better to do it on the state level where the time and money spent is actually worth it. There is no other reason to try to pass county level initiatives that are preempted by state law and clearly can't be implemented except to end in down-stream litigation.,0

4290,Talk about Republican revisionist history! This is what Trump said  January 10: “I feel that repeal and replace have to be together...  January 17  2017: “There was a philosophy in some circles that if you can’t pay for it  you don’t get it. That’s not going to happen with us.”  We’re going to have insurance for everybody ” Trump said.  " People covered under the law “can expect to have great health care. It will be in a much simplified form. Much less expensive and much better.”  September 27  2016: " I am going to take care of everybody. I don’t care if it costs me votes or not. Everybody’s going to be taken care of much better than they’re taken care of now.  Scott Pelley: The uninsured person is going to be taken care of how?  Donald Trump: They’re going to be taken care of. I would make a deal with existing hospitals to take care of people. And  you know what  if this is probably–  Scott Pelley: Make a deal? Who pays for it?  Donald Trump: –the government’s gonna pay for it.,0

4298,I'm writing because I can't add more than one star emoji.  I would add to your excellent comments the fact that even if once in a while some rogue scientist or committee does do something unethical  that fact in itself does not invalidate all legit scientific findings across an entire field. That it does is also a talking tactic of the alt-right as well.  I think the tactic comes from a belief in magic: wave some laughably inadequate talking point in the air and poof  inconvenient things disappear!,0

4301,Paul Jenkins: Note that the ASD computes its next tax take using inflation and general population increases. Instead  the ASD should ONLY be using STUDENT population increases/decreases. Suppose the population of Anchorage increases 20 000 and none of these are of school age. The ASD still gets an increase in its budget take due to an inaccurate formula. Actually  the general population could go up and the student population could go down (which it has for several of the last 10 years) and the ASD still gets a bump in its budget. Wrong.,0

4304,And who might be entrusted to define ambiguous terms such as “adequate funding”?  Funding has become an all-purpose scapegoat for the entrenched mediocrities who run our public education system. It is far too easy to shakedown taxpayers with disingenuous protests that voters who refuse to provide a blank check for public schools don’t care about children.  In reality many of the most lavishly funded school systems in America are still failing.,0

4310,You know  in about a year  maybe two years  when the unemployment rate in Canada goes into double digits and people start paying for all these Carbon policies with higher and higher prices  Steven Harper will stand up in front of a gathering and give the shortest speech in history from a former Canadian prime minister.

4314,This is another reason why I'm glad I don't have to fly as part of my job any more.  I hope that the major carriers such as AC  WJ and Porter will continue requiring their pilots to maintain in-air hours  but I guess we won't have that guarantee any more.

4318,Understatement of the year.  The Browns should be thankful that they are too stupid to file in time to make a deadline.  They were offering a 2 and 3 for McCarron.  Apparently they forgot that they are 0-8 for the year and have no hope  so trading for McCarron for this year made no sense.  They are going to be in position to grab one of the top QBs in the draft instead.  They can get a QB in the first then use that 2 and 3 for weapons  protection or defense.,1

4323,Yet another ridiculously offensive comment. Weed had absolutely nothing to do with this. This was a group of non-humans who were simply seizing upon a convenient "excuse" (not...) to indulge themselves in wanton and senseless violence upon an outnumbered and essentially defenseless teen. By throwing out stupid comments such as yours  you attempt to lessen the responsibility that should be applied directly where it belongs. Upon the heads of these worthless and soulless walking trash.

4330,Actually  I have just read his 3 "social encyclicals" - particularly Centesimus Annus.  I was in Managua when he couldn't muster the compassion to extend his blessings to the 17 mothers on the podium who had lost children the previous week (Contras; Sandinistas and just caught in the cross fire) so that closed my heart and mind to him.  Turns out in CA - he has an equally scathing criticism of capitalism   and particularly of the kind of "free enterprise" promoted by the libertarian wing of the Republican party.  He really stresses the need for the state to protect the human and natural environment - as well as the importance of unions.  So did a certain political operative working on Ronald Reagan's staff facilitate JPII's relationship with this administration  the CIA's William Casey and so profoundly misunderstand what was going on in Central and South American?  Yes - he was confused about Marxism and Marxist/Leninism  due to his experience  but why was he so closed given his CA?,0
4331,That's because the far-left keeps pushing for disgusting and immoral values and keep shoving it down our throat. You reap what you sow. Not everyone is a racist animal; some people have valid concerns.,1

As for you and DiverDave exchanging missives  the way I see it in his mind he's DiverDave just as in your mind you are "pono (jonnie austen) keali'i".

4343,Holy Crap Rabbi!!  Read the damn Qur'an yourself. Sharia Law  for Muslim's is akin to the 10 Commandments for the Jews.  Infidels are worthy only of death. Guess what? YOU are an infidel.  Learn about Taqiiyya. It is the Muslims moral authority to lie to infidels if it furthers their cause.  World domination by Muslims is the point.  Fortunately there are two different factions: Sunni and Shiite. And  get a load of this  each think the other infidels.  Thats why there has been no peace in the middle east since about 700AD. Taqiyya also teaches its followers  if in a foreign country  to adopts its ways and means and obey the law of that given country.  But once they outnumber you  well it's Katie bar the door.,1
4344,I'll gladly sign whatever petitions come up on this matter. That is  I hope there's people willing to fight this.,0
4345,How can you screw up a hydro project that badly?  How? . Consider  also  that Labrador and the west coast of Newfoundland are the mother lode of wind power in North America.  For the same amount of money they could have built and installed 6000 wind turbines of 3 mW.  Wind power is now consistently used to generate electricity at less than 10 cents/kwH  even on very conservative assumptions (e.g.  cost of capital = 10%; economic life of 20 years)  with a marginal cost of about 1 cent/kwH.   . To put that in practical terms: If the real cost of capital is 4%  (not 10%)  after about 7 or 8 years the power is essentially free.  There is no reason to think that the mechanical life of a wind turbine will not substantially exceed 20 years.,0

4348,And the APD and the city has stuck their fingers in their collective ears for too long  allowing what at one point was just an isolated string of nuisances to explode into a full blown gang problem in this city. Maybe we should focus a little more on that instead of what a bunch of legal gun owners do in their personal time as long as it doesn't involve maiming or murdering other Alaskans.  Just a thought.,0

4355,"The presumption that you have to drastically raise prices to ensure profit margins are ever growing is the flaw in mindset. " . He is telling you - you are too stupid to understand it. How you like that ?,1
4356,Censoring curse words when quoting speech by printing things like "bull----" is stupid. Everyone reads "bull----" as "bullshit." If you were truly concerned about offending readers  you would say something like "called one person's testimony a bad word." Other countries don't sensor curse words (when quoting speech) why is it that we do? I'll say it again. It's stupid  and it demeans the reader.,1
4357,Korea has had a long history of being invaded numerous times by China and Japan. Koreans fear of invasion is not illogical paranoia it's instilled in them by history.  After Japan lost the war and it's brutal occupation of Korea  the US and Russia cut up Korea in a proxy cold war division of North Korea and South Korea. In the Korean civil war  when the North invaded the South  the US lost 50 000 troops. Same as the intervention in the Vietnam civil war.  Current events is best understood through history than headlines.,0
4358,The point I was making was that this isn't a Liberal Conservative partisan issue. To be honest I don't know what the NDP position is.,0
4359,Unfortunately  many Trump supporters don't have decency. They don't understand the need for decency  integrity  honesty  or respect. They are loud mouth and ignorant  which is why they like a "leader" who is loudmouth and ignorant. It makes them feel like they are ok. They don't care that Trump is owned by Putin. They don't care that all of these things put our country in grave danger. The depth of their stupidity has yet to be identified.,1

4373,The Democrats are living in Fantasyland.  They are believing their own biased media and rigged polls--and look how that turned out. They can't raise any money and they have a lunatic in Tom Perez running the DNC with the radical Moslem Keith Ellison as vice-chair.  How well do you think that's going to play in the heartland?  2018 is going to be a bloodbath for RINOs and Democrats and they don't even see it coming because they are so blinded by self-righteous bigotry that they can't see what it obvious to everyone--America is fed up with being lied to  robbed blind and stupid and the voters are furious over the crap and corruption fomented by obama and the corrupt DC elite and are going to send them packing.,1
4374,His crash is under way. The most glorious and horrendous political crash in modern history. You say that his supporters are firmly entrenched to support him. He is their leader  their Hitler  their Stalin. But there are a huge number of people who voted him that weren't those nutcases. They were bitter and angry "average Americans" and "tried something new." They are immediately streaming away from support of Trump's presidency - by the millions each and every day. Only three weeks in to his time of "rule." Don't get too optimistic el Duque and I am hoping that the millions who love him won't ruin their country by "screaming" their points for years and years afterward. An embarrassment for America worldwide - except maybe in Moscow. Look at today's polls. Trump is crashing AND despised by the media. You will be horribly disappointed when he is "politically" dead. A modern-day demon.,1

4384,I'm not blind.  Here's proof--I just read  and am currently answering  a post by a childish idiot who seems incapable of supporting his arguments with facts  and therefore must resort to pathetic  infantile attempts at 'insult' that he should have grown out of by the 6th grade.,1

4391,The NRA  Trump and Vegas.... whether you like it or not   all three are inextricably linked.  Can America be saved and/or salvaged?,0
4392,I think this is where it is because Trump did something no President since the Armastice has done. Remember early April?  Trump claimed to have sent an "Armada"?  And was talking about what US missiles from that Armada were capable of? Past Presidents allowed Jong Un to say stuff without making big body militatarily. Levels of appeasement  and definitely refusing to take the rhetoric bait  clearly prevented numerous missile tests  which was squarely in the US interest. Trump  not only took the bait then made big body  but was bluffing.  Making big body confirms NK's fear of attempted regime change. But  BLUFFING told NK that MAYBE it could ratchet up the activity.   Now  we're here. What would you rather have?  Obama's appeasement results?  Or  deployment of a nuclear device against US treasure? Trump's being played like a low intelligence schoolyard bully.,0
4393,More honest? Are people that stupid? He has hidden  lied or cheated his way out of practically everything that he has done. If the American people elect this imbecile then they deserve whatever they have coming because he will be an unmitigated disaster. Unfortunately for the rest of the world we will have to deal with this moron for at least 4 years. Hopefully the American people are not this stupid.,1

4396,I always wondered how we could make serving the people as an elected "public servant" more appealing. After reading this article in its entirety I see that all of us Alaskans could be doing so much more for destitute families like the Olson family. Thank you ADN for shining a beacon of light into this injustice our elected officials face on a daily basis. Please everyone  band together and continue to try in the best ways you can to help these needy souls. I'm just so happy that we can all come together and on this subject during such bountiful economic surplus and help the "little guy".,0

4399,Mr editor  you of all people should realize this is just a sales tax on everyone. Even with the massive amounts of money thrown at schools it has not improved graduation rates at all. Oregon does not need the state sucking more money out of working people's checks to spend as they see fit. If Oregon voters are stupid enough to approve this tax and the money is wasted on pet projects the bureaucrats and public employees unions will come up with a new tax for their next fix.,1
4400,Wow  If this story is true  I've lost all respect for Wyland.  To somehow say you control what a landowner can do to their own building because they gave you a platform to display your art is complete crap.  Sad.  This will all but kill future murals.  I use to respect the guy.  Truly sad.,1

4406,And timing is everything once again.  Had our election followed Brexit and the ascent of Trump instead of preceding those events  we may have decided to stay the course with Harper  who would likely have kept populism at bay in Canada.  Yet Trudeau triggers it.  And the timing of our next election may be well past a global crest in populism  though the issues of fiscal irresponsibility and weak leadership will likely persist and influence the outcome of the election either way.,0
4407,Well Peter  I only wish all gun owners had your training and perspective.   It's still highly likely you won't hit the target under stress  but if down to the last resort - as you described it  it maybe the only option left.  I'm not at all confident that many gun owners wouldn't freeze or make an error.    My Iowa friends got cheap carry permits and it only took about 2 hours  including the lesson and the written test.  Police train every year  many times a year.   It's not enough  all gun owners should have to demostrate competance.  That's a bare minimum.  People like the allusion of 'safety' with a gun.   But as my father in law used to say  when your number comes up  it's up.     You may improve your odds a tiny bit  but considering the odds of being shot are very low  it's not likely.    We'd all be safer with fewer weapons  but that has to include the criminal element as well  that's Very Dangerous.    LOL  we'll probably both die choking on a chicken bone,0
4408,Such a savvy  media-sexy journalist who  since day one  allied himself with his inner circle of resentful power hungry independestists always ready to blame Franco ( who died in 1976 please ...) for anything that rocks their feudal  and so corrupt hold in  Catalonia  knew how to exploit and deceive a democratic Constitution at forcing  plot   an illegal referendum that alienated more than half of Catalonians ( those are facts  do your home work and find out ...); the man didn´t have the guts to face the music of deceit and corruption and escaped to Belgium  leaving Catalonia´s economy in shambles and the societal body divided to the rancorous core. What a great job! That man also was so generous to all those leeches ¨working¨(?) at those mushrooming   chi chi expensive  Catalonian embassies - a paralet state by the way -  in New York City  Paris  London  Berlim  you name it ...: about CA 500 millions taken from Spain  to finance the good life of independentists abroad. What a life.,0

4412,Omg   the issue is that trudeau is clueless. I dont think anyone would be making this big a deal out of this if he wouldnt have said anything about making the taxes "fair" with all the new proposed tax changes. Everyone knows this stuff happens and it always will. If he would think before he opens his mouth perhaps people wouldnt think hes such a twit. When he goes on about fairness and then this comes out he looks silly. If he would have left everything the same and this came out  not quite the same reaction.  Either way justin is a clown.

4416,Yes it is censorship  but unfortunately  it’s censorship by a private corporation  which is entirely within its rights to censor whatever content it wants. That is the great dilemma of social media. Even though it’s the primary means of expression for most people nowadays  the normal rules regarding freedom of speech don’t apply to it.,0
4417,That is good advice  but there is a point when it becomes victim blaming.  Determining that point is difficult.  Don't wear a dress that is too revealing?  Don't wear a bikini?  High heels?  Maybe "don't leave the house without a male family member and your face covered". . That is the challenge in giving such advice.  The two ends of the spectrum are easy to determine.  It's the middle grey area that's difficult to navigate.,0

Not included in those support payments are additional fundings given for childcare  WIC  school lunch programs  Medicaid or weatherization.  Not fair. Now ACLU wants workers to pay for these individuals who consciously choose a lifestyle without discipline or responsibility.,0

4426,Don't attribute to malevolence what  in the case of the G&M  is far more likely to be explained by sheer  unremitting incompetence.  I had a post yesterday disappear for a time with the marker that it didn't meet civility standards  even though at that point it had 39 Likes.  Mysteriously  it reappeared a couple of hours later.  The reader comments software is just as buggy as it has ever been.  It's not so much that the G&M won't fix it: they're too daft to know that there's even a problem.,0
4427,from Berig in Rochester  N.Y.  Mr. Bissonnette seems to have had a psychotic break.  Looks like a perfect storm engulfed him  from Marine Le Pen to Donald Trump  to childhood trauma and adult deficits of affections and social alliances.   Perhaps your PM's analysis of Boston Bomber would be aptly applied here    “Now  we don’t know now if it was terrorism or a single crazy or a domestic issue or a foreign issue ” he said. “But there is no question that this happened because there is someone who feels completely excluded. Completely at war with innocents. At war with a society. And our approach has to be  where do those tensions come from?",0

4433,The headline editor appears to be engaging in intentionally provocative activity.  The highly misleading headline says: "Canada to accommodate people affected by Trump’s executive order".

An accurate headline would be: "People in Canada affected by Trump’s order to be accommodated".`,0

4437,One poll shows Obamas approval rating at 51% supported by those on the left.

4448,Jimbo5 couldn't agree with you more.....I get so tired of CTV And CBC and other media outlets sensationalizing the "poor stranded  hard done by Canadians" expecting the Canadian Government to immediately send a private jet to fly their loved ones home to their families back in Canada whose homes (in Canada) have running water  electricity and an abundance of food when people in the hardest hit countries have just lost all they had and more regrettably a loss of life. It is completely insensitive and  unacceptable and un-Canadian. CANADIANS & MEDIA WAKE UP: 1)refer to your knowledge of seasonal world weather patterns (Hurricane Season) 2)Avoid those areas if you are at all concerned of any risk or danger you could place yourself in 3)access the internet daily and be current on world affairs  weather  and local happenings.  4)plan accordingly if you feel you are at risk 5)be thankful you have advance warning  unlike the people in Mexico and Guatemala when an 8.2 quake struck last week.,0

4457,Exactly! I'm also a million miler  and I would train brand new drivers on The Widow Maker. Never burned up the brakes much less had to take a ramp. We would hit that peak  then 5th gear with the engine brake on and never had a problem.,0
4458,The publisher would argue  of course  that this wasn't journalism. It was an opinion piece from someone's whose trade is other than journalism. But it's the publisher that gives it credence by granting it space in its paper.   A forum for reader feedback like this (poorly structured though it may be) can very quickly signal public disdain for poorly argued  ill-supported commentary.   Butt can't be pleased with the blowback. A large majority of posters disagree vehemently with his over-the-top criticisms of the Chief Justice. More embarrassing perhaps is that the few who have come to his defence are so off base as to want to make him cringe.,0
4459,NOT!,0
4460,Bernie is working for a "revolution" from decades of corruption that is literally killing all life on earth.  If we don't make drastic changes- campaign finance reform  universal health care  affordable/free college  transition to clean renewable energy  energy and resource conservation  a carbon tax and include all the externalities in products-- we will be toast.  We are the cause of the sixth mass species extinction already underway as is the global warming crisis.  The business as usual system that benefits the few  pollutes our natural resources  destroys wildlife habitats  and many suffer-- must end. It's way past time we grow up and face truth instead of burying our heads in the tar sands oil.,0
4461,I actually completely agree with you. I hiked it one time on a (previous) wrenched knee  knowing what I would be hiking. But maybe some people are more of a 'baby' than others?

4463,I don't see it mentioned in a quick reading of the story  but did she want an English speaking deaf interpreter or was she demanding a Japanese-speaking deaf interpreter. Shouldn't be that hard to provide her with an English speaker ASL communicator  but providing one in another language is more difficult. Just because she attended school in the US and has a boyfriend here in Hawaii doesn't mean she speaks English.,0
4464,Zuma pays his praise singers. The ANCYL  ANCWL  MKMVA are all in place and Zupta-funded to sing praises whenever they get the call. Bell pottinger was paid to reinforce a message. ANN7 is paid to reinforce a message. All of the funds to keep these "praise singers" running are inevitably funneled from One Source: The state (ie the tax-payer).  A Zuma without news control and "professional friends" and a state-funded propaganda machine is not sustainable.,0

4476,I demand the Canadian government issue a travel advisory to the U.S.A. Declare it as a dangerous war zone. Canadians who still travel there are therefore on their own.   At least 3 Canadians are killed in L.V. in this epic mass murder. If this happened in any other country the government will be screaming. The silence is unacceptable.   The American gun culture will not decline. I expect it to grow even bigger. Ever more people will be armed  and armed with the most lethal automatic guns. This Paddock guy owed 42 firearms  23 in the hotel room. Two machine guns on tripod with ammo belt  two sniper rifles on tripod pointed out of the windows. More than 1000 rounds fired. Hundreds more rounds ready to go. He was on a war.   There will be more mass murders. There is now one mass shooting  with more than four victims  per day:     First 9 months of 2017:     -11 572 gun deaths     -23 365 gun injuries     -271 mass shootings     -1 508 unintentional shootings     -2 971 kids/teens shot,1

4485,Most reasonable criticism of this scandal has nothing to do with the Aga Kahn himself.

One major mistake the left made  and is continuing to make  is that although you attribute character flaws and misstatements to the President it is not him  but rather it is you who have to live with them  because you expose the nasty  hateful  message underlying your position that has nothing to do with him.,0

The era of "post-truth" is indeed sadly amongst us.   " But as I have noted before  our media was more liberal in those times.

4517,Bob  While I agree with some of what you said  being a staff member of UAA I can attest that there have been many decisions made with regard to strategic pathways that make no sense. firstly UAF has had a political agenda for years to house and control most services within their campus.  They attempted to absorb the College of Education  they successfully absorbed UAA and UAS email services  they just took over the Blackboard online learning system  they've made the attempt numerous times to absorb all of Information Technology into their folds.  All of this has been done and attempted with no release of any kind of cost/benefit analysis.  Go to any business and ask them if they make a major restructuring without that analysis and they will tell you "Hell no"! Obviously U of A doesn't think they need this. As for your doctrine of "This ain't no democracy"  that may hold true for a privately owned business  but definitely not for a publicly funded not for profit institution!!  Mic drop!,0
4518,The term for what we are dealing with is moral hazard.  What it means is someone taking more risks because someone else is bearing the burden for those risks.  People brought this up during the banking crisis of 2008 as private gains and public losses.  Houston is working on getting away with it for the current flooding where they knew it was a risk but didn't take reasonable steps to mitigate those risks.  The history of flood insurance is one of moral risk.  The question becomes since we have bailed out many areas over the years how can we say no to this one?  For Sandy it was easy for the Texas GOP representatives to say no because it was all those rich liberals up there in New England.  Now that it is hitting all of these deserving souls in the holy city of Houston the shoe is on the other foot. The last question is what happens when something like this happens in Colorado (and it has only with a smaller loss)?,0

As to the Oil  take a look at the England Scotland border  the norm is for the sea border to follow the land border where it ends  it kicks North. Scotland has worse deficit to GDP ration than Greece and is currently subsidized by the rest of the UK to the tune of CAD 25 billion per year or some $5 000 per person.

Homeless people will be there  regardless  because they have to be somewhere. Most of them are harmless and they don't like living in chaos either. Constantly forced by the police to move  because of the city's camping ban  they are very stressed.   Most of the homeless are that way temporarily. They are much more likely to get housed again if they are not harassed and stressed. The city's present policy of constantly forcing the homeless to move is just making things worse for everyone  homeless and housed.,0

Maybe Ritz's form of sexism might have still have agency in some remote parts of Canada  which have been protected  by distance  from societal changes in the last 50 years  but that type of  put-down (Climate Barbie) would get you disciplined in any contemporary office place these days.

4551,In the US  the primary responsibility for labour issues rests with the States not the Federal Government. Unions can organize wherever they want but in so-called Right to Work states no one can be forced to join a union so the Feds can't negotiate this issue with NAFTA.  American workers  especially in the South have repeatedly rejected attempts to unionize. Most recently Boeing and BMW employees here in South Carolina rejected the UAW. That's why manufacturers prefer to locate in states that don't mandate that employees join a union. Obviously employees are happy with the wages they make  (Socialist) Canada on the other hand forces employees to join a union if the majority votes to organize. The result is continuing strikes and wages and benefits that the market can't support. Eventually companies decide to re-locate. That's what happened in Brantford ON in 1988 when Massey Ferguson closed and put 3000 people out of work. The US can't make laws that are prohibited by the Constitution.,0

If you knew you were going to cut TJ Ward (another mistake as it broke up chemistry and Simmons is more times than not positioned incorrectly) spend some extra cash on a stud RT like Ricky Wagner.  He goes cheap at QB  cheap on tackles  cheap on coaches  and this is the result.  I doubt we win more than two games the rest of the way  where we will end up taking another QB in the first round that Elway will whiff on. I hope we get new ownership and they kick Elway to the curb and let him go be a contributor on Fox News or whatever position he can be in the right-wing spotlight that he desires. Ego maniac qb's don't make good GMs  they still think its all about them and they can do it all themselves! You didn't win until you had a stud o-line and RB Elway! That's the problems with conservatives  they don't learn!,0
4554,So  why is it that Donald Trump continues to play his trumpet when he is tone deaf? He should be dismissed. We need a leader who motivates and inspires people.

If I purchased a stolen car and then 10 years later gave just the floor mats back would we be ok with that?  BACK to reality where anything is legit  as long as someone else says it's ok... I am actually for the NPS at least they protect the land and culture  something only the natives were able to accomplish for 10000 years.

Unfortunately  that included practically every union worker in the US.  The AFL-CIO President Trumpka told all the unions in America to back Obamacare without reading the bill.  When the ILWU read the Obamacare law  they found out their members would be paying $10 000 to $20 000 in taxes.  As a consequence  the ILWU withdrew from the AFL-CIO over this blunder.  To make Obamacare work just pay your fair share of taxes and don't cry about it being unfair  it is Obama's law  blame him.,0
4575,It is downright surreal to witness the inarticulate  narcissistic  growling abomination that is Donald Trump  and the lengths his ignorant supporters will go to justify them.

Puana's mother didn't have trust in her son to help her in her affairs of her assets.  Flores  Thompson  are  the 4 who will do the voting and all 4 must agree on one.  Sword is out and not voting.  Allie is traditional indian with respect to any whether Samoan   Hawaiian or Micronesian   they don't like anyone who isn't in their indian tribe or anyone who isn't Samoan or anyone who isn't Micronesian.  As for Hawaiians they exist without an alii to lead them.  as for allie   hope she finds her way back to N. Dakota to the mandan tribe  that is   if she isn't casted out by them.

You are supremely incorrect that tribal societies are and were no different than "civilizations " in ways too numerous to state here. There are universal human characteristics that people share  also too numerous to list here  but the things you claim to be universal are not among them. My background is more complex than being a "local." It's why my views are different.  People like you and I cannot get anywhere when the conversation is limited to values and judgments  which is where you keep things. You refuse to give credit to anything I point out  even when I mention how money  organized religion  writing  HUGE disparity of wealth and power  and other specific and measurable characteristics DO make HUGE differences between the worldviews (reality) of tribal societies and "civilizations."   The fact that all people have wrongdoing does NOT mean that all cultures are the same. I'm done.,0

4595,This is true (Democrats' fault). Let's walk the dog on who's fault is the Vietnam War: 1. FDR (D). He held back on his nominally anti-colonialism stance with regard to France & Indochina in order to placate France because of his foresight of a cold war. 2. Truman (D). Ditto #1  above. Assisted France in its colonialism there. 3. Eisenhower (R). Expanded (but still only a little) the Advisory aspect of US involvement. 4. Kennedy (D). Set the US on a trajectory to massive involvement. His "we will support any friend...fight any foe..." speech. Then his expansion of the Green Berets. (How many of you hippy readers spat on those baby killers? Well  you beloved Kennedy ordered their expansion and authorized their green hat). 5. Johnson (D). MASSIVELY expanded the war. Nuff said. 6. Nixon (R)(but really a D in R clothes). Ended the US involvement. 7. Ford (R). Refused to aid the South in the final (1975) invasion from the Communist.  IRONIC. Seems the Ds did all the warring!!!,0

The "LITC" students represent low income individuals in tax controversies under the guidance of a professor who is a member of the bar. A law student actually made the oral argument to the Circuit Court. The students won. The experience will certainly make these students better lawyers.

4601,Oh no  since Trump is a true elitest - and cares less about the working class  except for what they can do for him - anyone with a brain knew he was going to surround himself with fellow elitest users like himself.  As a narcissistic  egocentric  bullying and strangely personally insecure billionaire who inherited money from daddy and made money by cheating everyone with whom he came into contact  I expected him to do exactly what he did. Only an idiot would think Trump cares about the common working man. Only an idiot would believe anything he says. Only an idiot would vote for him. Only an idiot would support him.,1
4602,I agree with one of the other posters - once fund managers for actively-invested funds can show that they can consistently beat the index  money will start flowing back from index investing to active investing.    Unfortunately (for Sarbit)  the numbers from his funds don't back up what he's preaching.  The first fund that he mentions in the article  IA Clarington Sarbit US Equity Trust  has gained an average of 6.6% over the past 5 years  vs. 18.2% for the S&P as a whole.  Meanwhile  you pay Sarbit a MER of 2.68% a year for the "privilege" of this underperformance.  The other fund mentioned  IA Clarington Sarbit Activist Opportunity Fund  has only been around for 3 years - during this time  it has gained an average of 1.4%  versus 20.6% for the S&P as a whole.  The MER of this fund is also a pricey 2.43%.     Basically  the numbers show that only someone who wants to pay a lot for a couple of underperforming funds would invest with Sarbit.,0
4603,Mr. 3rdRock; . Actually the best grunts are in the 35 to 55 age group  they have familial responsibilities and resigned to their fates.

4621,I agree that politicians should be held accountable whenever they are doing something contrary to the good of the country. But here is my question: If Trump's tax plan turns out to benefit him  should we jettison it no matter what? If it hurts Trump  should we accept it no matter what? How about if it is neutral for Trump? It seems to me we should judge any tax plan on whether it is good or bad for the country as a whole  rather than for a specific individual  even if he is the one proposing it. The Democrat's statement of not even considering any tax plan until Trump releases his taxes is therefore nothing but a stalling tactic  knowing they don't have the votes to get their way. They are blatant obstructionists  and having spent the last several years accusing the Republicans of doing the same  they are also hypocrites. Big ones.,1

4636,So please explain to the world how a global agreement to stem the world from polluting our atmosphere is Anti-American?  Do you think we can drink Fossil Fuels some day? Or maybe the technological advances in Sunscreen will keep up with the ever-increasing violent UV rays that bake our skin throughout the day?   Please  explain to us how the Paris agreement is Anti-American. You claim to not like pollution but don't want to do anything to curb it  which will have the added benefit of reducing CO2 and other harmful gasses in the atmosphere.   Sounds like you want your cake while still feeding your face with it. Get over yourself. Stop listening to InfoWars and the other mainstream media outlets and actually read what 99.99% of scientists (climate scientists) have said for ~170 years (yeah  they first discovered that fossil fuels would cause global climate change back in the mid 1800s and it wasn't until the 70s/80s when the oil companies hired their own "scientists" to refute this fact),0

4638,when the oil price dropped and the oil taxes went up the truck drivers lost their jobs and moved back to NFLD.

4639,Something that this activist deliberately ignores is that many of the oilfields around the world are being rapidly depleted.

4646,Plenty of people still smoke.  Intoxication is still irrelevant to the issue at hand---That rape is rape  whether the victim is fighting back  passive  or unconscious.  Yes  widespread alcoholism is a public health issue every bit as much as cigarette smoking  perhaps more  and people who drink and harm others  and themselves  represent a huge strain on public health resources.  This is a cautionary tale on drinking to excess  fairly self evident to anyone reading it---But the real story is the amorality of the perpetrator  and the willingness of a life of privilege to excuse abhorrent behavior among its own:  A justice system systematically canted toward the moneyed few  at the expense of everyone else.,0
4647,Ross Coen I know several people who I had very civil discussions with about politics using facts to back up conclusions. Unfortunately many of those same civil people when on line became very uncivil. Some became downright disgustingly vulgar.

She would have been fired and we would not be writing to each other."  His position to me means it didn't happen. So now I have a question for you  in the unproven allegation the parent was not on school grounds and the student was free to walk to them. Had it occurred to anyone that the RO included the school grounds? Have you now forced the custodial parent to interact with a person with an RO?,0

4667,I've looked at the financials of a number of these firms.   A number of them (not all) have concentrations of business in Canada's most overheated housing markets that are concerning -- both in terms of insured and non-CMHC insured activity as well as other banking business.  What's really crucial for individuals who choose to deposit with these firms is to be aware of the CDIC limits and stick to them.   Because of the potential for short-term disruptions in a crisis situation (like Northern Rock) it's also a good idea to consider making deposits at a second FI that has a different risk profile.,0
4668,Another pathetic attempt to put all Trump supporters in the same basket. Grow up.,1
4669,The problem is that huge part of economic globalization's logic is based on wage suppression. Who in Canada could afford to buy a million-dollar-plus Toronto tear-down bungalow while earning Indian level or even Mexican level wages? Suppressing wages by moving work to low-wage jurisdictions and skimming the cost differential as enhanced profits is a short-term game that eventually breaks the virtuous circle that's most famously associated with Henry Ford  who understood that if his workers couldn't afford to buy the cars they were producing there was no point in manufacturing the cars. The reality is that corporations and governments have used many methods to artificially suppress wages even in non-manufacturing service industries that serve mainly Canadian markets. Corporations demand (and get) protection  including in some cases guaranteed profits  while workers are too often left to twist in the wind.,0

Fact 2: Military personnel who contract diabetes while on active duty are normally discharged.

However  I wonder if the provinces will want to get into this as Ottawa isn't always a reliable dance partner.

4675,I have not read a good reason for delaying this project.  Just a bunch of excuses that sound like a hidden agenda.  The golf course needs to be improved and the storm water needs to be controlled to prevent flooding - which will be necessary with the larger and larger storm events that climate change has brought to us.  The naysayers are making excuses - taxes  water fees  big government agenda to sell the land  ANYTHING to try and stop progress or needed changes.  You whiners sound like the repubs in Congress.

4683,Using the least persuasive arguments for Gorka's membership in Vitezi Rend is hardly a sign that you've seriously considered the accusation. Either you can conclude that lots of people in Hungary lied in responding to a journalist  or that the journalist lied with lots of names who should be easy to check up with  or Gorka lied either past or present regarding his membership in Vitezi Rend. Given his use of v. in his name ... in this I have no doubts. https://www.nbcnews.com/https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/sebastian-gorka-made-nazi-linked-vitezi-rend-proud-wearing-its-n742851 has a much stronger case for his membership  along with a bit more information about Vitezi Rend.

4686,And yet  78% of the viewers liked the man delivering the speech and the content.  The writer of this editorial is not one of them. Of course  after a year of singularly negative coverage  nobody really expects the political "experts"  who called the election so well  to say anything else. BTW  the content of this speech was exactly the same as the many campaign speeches he delivered all over America during his run. Those of us who paid attention  saw and heard nothing new  last night. It was delivered in a different tone because an address to the joint session of Congress is not an election campaign stop. A tiny detail that the esteemed Globe and Mail writer omitted to notice. I'm convinced  as a subscriber  that it was an honest mistake.,0
4687,No.  Trump adopted the phrase 'America First' because it was an old racist Nazi buzzword from years ago. It was a dog-whistle siren call to his white supremacist brethren. Then Bannon spewed out some word salad for Trump to further butcher in an attempt to deny it. They came up with the empty 'isolationism' that Trump immediately denied when he met with Merkel. Trump never had any foreign policy  other than looking to skim money wherever he could. He's a petty con man  not an actual reasoned or sane human being  he's a fraud. He's imbalanced  unfit for office. Now we have a weak and insecure  belligerent child who imagines himself a fascist saviour. He's no more than an egotistical juvenile buffoon. We need to remove him from the office  get him out of office now.  Trump is a white supremacist  Nazi sympathizer who should be removed from office.,1

4694,"Mayor Dan Sullivan's administration is asking for an extra $8.4 million to pay for contract work on Anchorage's SAP information technology project through the end of September.  The request comes on top of the $22.5 million already spent in contracting for the SAP project  a complex overhaul of the city's automated financial system. The project is costing far more and taking longer than city officials originally said it would  and it has been stalled the last two months while experts conducted two evaluations." —ADN February 27  2015  Thanks  Mayor Dan!

4698,Wayne Blank  CPA Most oil producing nations provide a production credit to the oil companies for extracting their oil. BP is paid $2 a barrel to extract Iraq's oil from its Ramadi field. Iraq then charges BP a tax on the sale of that oil which recoups the $2 credit and provides a comfortable revenue stream.  Alaska pays close to $50 a barrel for a production credit  so with oil below that level  we were paying them. They are now paying us  but not very much.  The argument is that Alaska is cold and remote  so companies need the incentive. Iraq is a war zone. I fail to see the difference. So  maybe to have a sweet pot  we don't low-ball them at $2 a barrel. Maybe set it at $5-10 a barrel. But make it a firm point. It doesn't go higher. That would be commonsense  which has absolutely nothing to do with Alaska oil tax schemes. I don't even know why we call it commonsense so it is so rare.,0

4700,Democrats can reliably win the Peoples' Republic of Juneau's downtown district  a couple or three districts in Anchorage  downtown  the U-Med  and East Anchorage  a district or two in Fairbanks  and a couple of rural districts.   It's been that way for thirty years.   Sometimes the Ds come up with a particularly attractive candidate that can win in some other districts and sometimes they put up candidates that sound more like conservatives than most Republicans do.   All the Democrat efforts in redistricting have been to try to dilute solidly Republican areas so they have some hope of coalitions.   Now their toy is false-flag Republicans backed by the Democrats for districts where a D is the kiss of death.   You lefties liked gerrymandering when Knowles led the reapportionment in '00.

4719,Trump's inability to evolve is a result of his being limited by his troglodyte brain. He is selfish and does not want to make anyone  or anything for that matter  great  except himself.

4754,"All levels of government were then supposed to discourage development in designated flood plains"  The need for 'due diligence' is reflected in Ontario's Provincial Policy Statement (PPS)  section 3.0 of which states  "Development shall be directed away from areas of natural or human-made hazards where there is an unacceptable risk to public health or safety or of property damage  and not create new or aggravate existing hazards."   The PPS contains extensive information about flood plains  environmental concerns and risks to public safety and protection of property. Nonetheless  municipal planners sometimes ignore the prescriptive requirements of the PPS and approve unsafe development. The lead ministry  Municipal Affairs  appears to have no enforcement/compliance personnel to ensure that PPS safety requirements are being followed.,0

Trump is testing the waters on pardoning his entire family  Jr. reveals emails showing clear intent to collude with the Russian government  Sessions recuses himself  Trump fires one FBI director and it looks like he is floating the idea of firing the special investigator  Robert Mueller. And these are just a fraction of the craziness surrounding this administration.,0
4759,aww shucks...........that much more $$$ i gotta go cacaroach for my rail,0
4760,Gov Walker had a successful career as an attorney fighting with the producers.  He's good at it. Sadly  it's his limitation as a governor. His approach is to build a litigation with the producers rather than a relationship. They don't trust him. No relationship  no trust. Alaska is not going to litigate the producers into investing billions in the gas pipeline. They have investment options outside of Alaska. He may be doing somethings right for Alaska  but that does not apply to the gas pipeline. This current brawl is ludicrous.  Oddly  he's become the roadblock for the very thing he's aspired to create.  He needs a leadership coach.,0
4761,I wonder how each of those idiot humans would feel if a bunch of goats with cameras chased their mother  father daughter or son onto the riprap and into the water and stood there taking pictures while they drowned.

4765,There's ALWAYS opposing statements for historical facts due emotional or vested interests.  Not that a fair entirety of historical truth cannot result from the biased point-of-view.  Rather  it is rare to find an exhaustive  unbiased  independent scholared historical dissertaion on anything.  The July 4 FAMILY presentation for the world at Iolani Palace credited ALL Hawaii.  Without its special interest sponsors  it would not have happened.   Those sponsors have personally sacrificed for years  acquiring the capacity to stage this presentation for Hawaii.  So  why don't those of opposing views organize the same for Hawaii's community?  Or  would it be waste time  or similar flake-off excuse?  Enlist your supporters to educate the community alternatively!  Yesterday's individuals engaged across-the-ancestral-aisle participation and support for their community staging.  For those in opposition  no talk.  Take action.  Where's your community staging?,0
4766,It's news because we finally have a president who is actually doing something about it.,0
4767,This is hardly a community divided.   A decades-old practice that harms no one  is now being used as a smokescreen by a small  fringe minority group intolerant bigots to vent their Islamophobia and making a big fuss over nothing. No one else has a problem with it whatsoever.  If you really think this is so wrong  pull together some of your brightest legal minds and put a solid case forth in Canadian courts. I personally would welcome the challenge.,0
4768,Jane Fonda  you arrived in Canada aboard a fuel-guzzling jet  you live in a huge fuel-guzzling house and you would be among the first to whine if Canada cut off oil supplies to your country.

4769,Here's a start  fire the totally incompetent (and that's putting it politely) federal justice minister who is solely responsible for this mess.

4773,In the article above it states  " The fair is officially a drug- and alcohol-free zone. Signs around the venue reminded people of this  and the Lane County Sheriff’s Office will have heightened patrols of the area until Monday".  What a JOKE  the OCF (Oregon Country FAILURE) powers to be might claim this  but people who attend always say they smell WEED  and people put Alcohol in Pepsi  Coke cups.  Drive by the Failure on Hwy. 126 and if the wind is right you will smell the WEED.    Lets see what the Sheriff's numbers are after Monday.  Of course the Sheriff's ticket violation numbers are NOT a TRUE  indication of what is really going on there as most of the Drug Users  Alcoholic's   do NOT leave the property until days after the Oregon Country Failure.     Read my Sign:  LOTSA WEED  LSD  METH   HALLUCINOGENIC Stuff   and ALCOHOL out there.   After all  this IS the  Oregon Country FAILURE.

4789,Totally agree. Cargo was a true 5 tool guy  and one of the best all round players in MLB for a few years. But even when he's NOT in the middle of a horrific slump  virtually the only time he seems to do damage  is when it's early  or we're way up or way down. He's completely regressed as he's aged  completely opposite of what's expected of a veteran. And I've said for a WHILE that he's literally THE LAST position player I want coming to the plate w/the game on the line.  CLEARLY  Story took offense at my comment  and is trying to wrest that title from him.  I wish there was a stat for the distance between the bat and the ball during clutch situation whiffs. I'm joking... kinda. But if they actually HAD such a stat  Cargo'd be among the league leaders. Be it sliders or curves off of the plate  or fastballs up around his shoulders  he misses by a LOT. He's a great guy  he's awesome in the locker room/dugout  and having a bilingual veteran leader in today's MLB sure can't hurt. But DAMN.,1

Hopefully  as the investigation into his shooting continues  we will learn more from the body-cams of the officers.  meanwhile  all you say and all I say is mere speculation based on our interpretation of the video...... we're welcome to those "opinions" until the "facts" are more definitively established.,0

The initiative specifically excluded hydro power as one of the renewable energy sources. So we're not going to be catching up with BC.,0

Today's fascism isn't p0litical fascism  it's economic fascism. It's not perpetrated by uniformed Brown Shirts and Black Shirts  it's done quietly  politely behind closed corporate doors with international liquid capital high finance.

"Yeah  I could quit anytime  no problem.  But I don't. Because I choose not to."  Sure.  But you're right: the people you describe successfully sidestep the law and kept themselves "safe" their buddies  neighbours and the friendly dealer down the street.  "Hey there  Joe..."  Well  today  thanks to proliferation of drugs  these kind of people ARE found on the floors: the floor of their bedrooms  their parents' rec rooms  all kinds of middle and upper-class floors.   "Okay!" you'll say. "So let's set up safe-sites."  No problem with that  as long as somebody else's money sets them up and keeps them running. Not MY money.

She didn't NEED the airline to oust him. I gaurantee she could have put words in the air that would have made him stare at the floor the entire flight in shame.

4830,You are correct that fossil fuels are behind modern civilization's benefits (and problems).  But just as climatology and oncology are sciences  so are geology and thermodynamics.  Much of the oil that Ore-is-gone uses flows through the Alaska Pipeline but that had declined three fourths in its flow since most of the Alaskan oil is used up.  Fracking for oil and gas has probably also peaked.  Global conventional oil peaked a decade ago.  It takes fossil fuels and minerals to make solar panels.  If we saw fossil fuels as a one time gift of Nature we might think more clearly about how to use what's left so our great grandchildren will have a better legacy than plastic waste  trash dumps and a ruined ecosystem.  Gold mining did not end in Cottage Grove because of environmental concerns  the ore is gone.  The early loggers (here and most other places) thought the old growth forest were inexhaustable  but they were wrong.  Go to the eastern US and try to find lots of big trees  they are rare,0

May will not call a referendum until article 50 negotiations are complete (two years from month end at the earliest). At that point the Scots can see where the best deal is. They will probably conclude that sticking with the UK (they do waaaay more trade with the UK than the EU) beats being outside both the UK and the EU.

But not the traditional analysis   We are living with taxation saturation   By any reasonable standard  taxation on individuals on over half of what they earn is outrageous  You can talk the middle class talk all you want   but the greatest  source of expenditure is taxation   not the mortgage or car payment   People have figured this out   and they are furious :  the difference in your life style is actually your government's reaching into your pocket and undermining your ability to take care of your family :   To save and to plan for retirement  to reduce consumer debt   all in the name of the greater good ?  Don't we all have bills to pay   children to educate and concerns about our economic future ?  Do we actually see the RRSP and TFSA limits as adequate to the task ?  And CPP at a $1000/ month ?

4868,I know  they modeled it on "Romneycare" and it didn't work there and Obamacare is not working now. I have a relative who is paying $800. per month with a deductible of $8 000. So she is paying for something she cannot use. She goes to the doctor  she pays out of pocket until she hits that deductible (maybe she will)  and for that she pays $800 per/month. I understand this is somewhat typical for the middle class. I have another friend who is quite poor and gets it all for free God bless her and good for her - so it works for the poor  but not for anybody else. Obamacare is well meant - it just will not be sustainable.,0

4875,Kara is so cute when she pretends to be angry.  She can pout and pretend things are just terrible for her industry  but that is her job  to spin nonsense to increase the profits for some of the richest corporations on the planet.  Here are the facts Kara omitted:  1.  Our oil tax structure changed because her industry was bribing numerous Republican politicians.  2.  Before 2002 Alaska had seldom ever enjoyed high oil prices- particularly oil above $35 dollars per barrel.  The industry spin that $35 dollar oil is not profitable is nonsense.   3.  Big Oil keeps secret the tax filings it makes in Alaska.  If Kara wishes to make those filings public we could see just how much profits the industry makes.  What we do know is that at current prices $7 billion dollars worth of oil is taken tax free  every year.  There is no way the industry is not making huge profits.  The pipeline was paid for years ago.  The infrastructure used to get the oil out of the ground was paid for by Alaskans.,0
4876,What is more sad about Trump are the legion of lackeys and stooges who know deep down inside he's an ignorant clown  but out of blind stupidity and hanging on like a cheap groupie they'll support him anyway.,1
4877,And a subsequent reinterpretation could affirm that the previous decision overstepped.,0

4880,Got to love Trump.  No more red carpet from the Kenyan illegal idiot!  The illegal Oidiot has no roots in this country from his black half.  We need to deport him too!,1
4881,Aw...you shouldn't have. I thought I'd at least get a kiss before you tried to fluck me  cuck.  I'm sorry troll cuck  I'm already taken  alas. But feel free to continue to obsess over me  lover.  No one will notice.,1

4886,Most don’t know if they are con artists  suckers for con artists  shills for con artists or some combination. Those who think of themselves as “cutting edge” are especially baffled about their own reality. Your own cover and lack of impulse control has obviously just been blown.,0

The Clintons  the DNC I am no lawyer in any form but even I can see that Lynch Rice Comey engaged in illegal activities. Those foundations of the Clintons  silence but the sheer amount of money it's disgusting.  The DNC.   Everything must be exposed people have just about had it  pitchforks is next if the rule if law does not prevail.  And no backroom deals etc.,0

4897,I think Manning and Chong are onto something.  Taxing pollution  while correspondingly lowering other taxes on income  or even general goods and services  is a heck of a lot more appealing than the inefficient Pandora's Box of cap and trade that seems to be the direction Ontario and Quebec is headed.,0
4898,This sounds like Black racism to me:  Knifing and persecution of a disabled young white man because they thought he voted for Trump.   Chicago Police say because the four black defendants shouted "“F**k white people. F**k Donald Trump ” at their victim they will 'consider' whether that was sufficient indication that a hate crime had taken place."  "They removed a piece of his scalp with a knife  while punching him in the face  cursing at him  threatening to “shank” him with a long knife  and forcing him to praise black people  denounce white people  and say “F**k Donald Trump.”  "Videos shot by the suspects show that they forced their captive to drink from the toilet while being beaten.",1
4899,Study after study says money is not a motivator.  Some don't even know what their take home pay is especially those who get upset when CPP and EI kick in come January.  In the US  Social Security is taken up to about $110 000 vs the little over $50 000 cut off here for payroll taxes.  And the top rate kicks in at 200K which is perhaps the 1% and not the middle class at all.  And by the way  that lower rate at the lower level of income applies to everyone  not just those whose total income is in that bracket.  The authors know that but prefer to repeat the disinformation campaign.,0

4906,I voted 3rd party. Funny I was told by a Trump voter that my 3rd party vote was a vote for Hillary and you tell me my 3rd party vote was a vote for Trump.,0
4907,Good point. It has been clear for a long time that guys who used to have thinly veiled Russkie handles were placing Russia-friendly posts on here.   Now they have plausible handles but they are still placing comments here to pervert CDN political thinking. I think they are on Vlad's payroll  probably working in some obscure -kstan for a few rubles. I don't think that's their fault. Everyone has to eat.   In the end we have Vlad to thank for these posts.,0
4908,In a sane world  he'd be tied to the glacis plate. Hard to believe( well not really) that that feckless moron could have been president.,1
4909,Trump Criticizes His Own Justice Dept. In Tweets About Travel Ban And he's calling it a ban again. He's really stupid.,1
4910,It's taking so long because there is a federal law that supersedes the state law  so in other words  Hawaii jumped the gun.  Hopefully  President Trump stops this nonsense and not legalize Marijuana and these dispensaries.  Like I said before  if it helps with pain  then it can be prescribed like any other medication at the pharmacy in a pill  syrup  or injection form.  There is absolutely  no need for it to be smoked!  Smoking is recreational and all we need is to pollute our clean air with marijuana.  Aren't we trying to get Americans to stop smoking?  Legalizing Marijuana defeats the purposes of smoking bans!  What next  legalize cocaine because it's all naturallllll?  Again  our politicians needs to get their heads out of their behinds and think of the majority  not the minority pot heads!  What is our world coming to???????????????,0
4911,Mr. Walker  I was not available for comment on election night as I was volunteering at Bremerton's National Night Out.  This was a great event supporting our residents  showing community evolvement with police and fire.  A number of support services were readily available to answer questions.  Mayor Lent also spent election night in attendance  she is a very energetic  supportive and involved Mayor.  Also in attendance were: Bremerton Police Chief Strachan  Community Resource Officer Joe Sexton  and Councilman Richard Huddy.  Thank you to the voters who supported me to move forward to the General Election. I am honored at having received your vote.  I wish Mr. Mathews the best in his future endeavors.  I enjoyed attending Bremerton's National Night Out and look forward to the event next year.  Sincerely  Patricia (Pat) Sullivan Incumbent Bremerton City Councilmember District 1,0
4912,You can't legislate stupid I'm afraid.,1
4913,Common sense would prevail knowing this is wrong.  We do not need to hear it from the "educated" and politicians to know right from wrong.  The "Cold Hearted" President who stated they need not be worried  he has a big heart in an interview with David Mier of ABC.  My response would be "He has a Heart"  we all do  only his  as mentioned "Cold" and also "Made of Stone".,0

4916,Lets see  unemployment up big time for 3 months in a row  unemployment applications were the lowest in 17 years last month.  Stock market  investing  is at an all time high. And now a huge tax break for the working middle class. So  it's all shibai  eh?,0
4917,.  "As has been the pattern for Trump’s White House  the controversy has sparked a new round of recriminations among the president’s team.   The president  in conversations with confidants  has questioned the quality of advice he has received from senior staff"  --  With His Orangeness  it's always someone else's fault .  Step up and be a man  Donald.  The buck stops on your desk  not on that of whichever underling you're blaming your problems on today.  Trump  through his staff  have denied that he knew anything about this meeting with the Russian lawyer.  Note that every politician I've seen asked the question "Is it possible that Donald Sr wasn't told about this meeting when it happened?" has said that it would be unthinkable that he didn't know that his son met with a Russian lawyer who was offering dirt on Hillary.  So Trump is letting his son take all the blame  throwing his own child under the bus to save his own thin skin.  What a small man he is.  .,0
4918,That's not the point. Risk factors increase to 8.5 (from .7 when cannabis alone is consumed) when drivers mix alcohol and cannabis. There does need to be some regulation around detecting this dangerous mix (e.g. a rapid/simple roadside test for law enforcement)  and educating consumers about the hazards (public safety).,0
4919,I'll drop by 505 Spike Lane and you can try it yourself.,0
4920,In discussions on other forums  some of the strong pro-gun folk pointed to Switzerland as their example of a low violence / crime stat nation which also required its citizens to be part of the 'state militia'- that many would have full-auto (military) weapons in their homes as part of the citizen army.   I had suggested that they may have a good idea- while not necessarily military service but some sort of public service for all who turn 18.   And then peeling the onion  I explored just how this citizen army had to show responsible gun possession- secured  locked  and all ammunition (issued by the govt) secured as well.   Many NRA members ARE for responsible gun laws.  Its the NRA top dogs who are more concerned about gun sales than gun responsibility that is the issue- and they hate the fact that Reagan was for strict gun laws in 1967 AND as president.,0

4986,I would add ONE(1) deduction  a personal deduction for each individual covered by the return.  Set this deduction so that a family of four(4) at the poverty level is tax free. Flat tax or progressive  I don't care  but one tax table for everyone (i.e. no married  single  or married filing separately).  Get government out of the marriage business; stop using tax code for social engineering. For an extended family  add all the income  subtract the individual deductions  and pay tax on the balance.  Eliminate corporate income tax!  They're a pass through  paid by customers. Need $s for taxes  raise prices. Congress uses this sleight-of-hand to fool the public.  I go back & forth on how to treat long term capital gains. If you consider them ordinary income  it makes no difference with a flat tax.  But with a progressive tax  they push you into a higher tax bracket.  This would induce investors to focus on short term ROI  which is bad for growth.,0

5007,The Skinny repeal that was voted on would have jeopardized two of the most important features of the Affordable Care Act. The irony of KellyAnne Conway blathering on about " just get a job that offers insurance" while the repeal bill would have purged the requirement that businesses provide insurance would be laughable if not so sad. And  the ACA requirement that individuals carry insurance makes everyone responsible for themselves. In the 1980's Ronald Reagan signed the Emergency Treatment and Labor Act which requires hospital emergency rooms treat all that walk through their doors regardless of ability to pay  nationality legal/illegal alien status. Mitt Romney callously referred to this bill when he implied people don't need insurance...they can go to the emergency room. Hospitals are offered tax breaks for their charity...recently hospital charity levels have dropped off due to the ACA. We tax payers should renegotiate the tax breaks they receive to better even the playing field.,0

5021,The reason why the Fiduciary dealing can't work is because even if the regulators implement it   how do you inforce it or prove the advisor wasnt working in the clients best interest. Some advisor sells a client an expensive investment and the next client gets sold  the cheapest investment  and over the next 3 years the expensive investments makes more money who would the regulator go after. The advisor who gouged the client says he did the right thing because he beat his competition. Explain how you would regulate that.,0
5022,The starting point should be  we can exist without America  but we cannot prosper. How can we advance our cause when our own government tosses our natural advantages aside- our energy and mineral wealth and imposes taxes  fees and levies that make us woefully uncompetitive? I'm not afraid of Trump- presidents come and go. What I'm terrified of is the repeat of the Ontario's experiment in "new economy" on a national scale.,0

5024,"WHAT are you smoking today?? I honestly think you need some help  John."  I distinctly remember when another poster suggested YOU need help (and this is someone who has credentials to know) and you nearly blew a gasket. Yet you have no problem saying the same to John.  Anyone who frequently uses "How dare you" in a post probably DOES have a problem  IMO. It smacks of a persecution complex.,0
5025,What are "fictional militia members?"  What exactly are you babbling about?,0
5026,it's not,0
5027,Really?  They are only one of 28 countries.  Remember  per the treaty  an attack on one is an attack on all of the member countries.  Even if NATO didn't exist  do you think any country would dare attack the US?  Do you think someone would consider attack Estonia or Iceland first?  Iceland doesn't even have a military and spends a mere 0.01% of its GDP on defense.    I doubt any country in the world would consider a direct military attack on the USA  NATO or no NATO.,0

Then democrats and liberals will agree to more lucrative contracts. In the end these Union morons will get a raise and tax dollars will pay to fix the bridge.,1
5039,More Chicken LIttle political ranting and raving. Trump is returning much of the heavy-handed  bloated  federal guidelines and regulatory responsibilities back over to the states. Those very states that are more knowledgeable about their own needs. And when you speak of lax standards of education  you can certainly lay the USA's poor comparitive world results on the federal government full of it's Democraticly lead education system. It's horrible and the those "standards" that you seem to pleased with are in sore need of improvement. Many of the states hate the meddling of the federal government in the (failing) education of their students. Why do you think charter and private schools have experienced such tremendous growth?! But  you're a liberal Kool-Aid drinker who's only idea is that if it's Republican  it has to be bad. That's why you've been on the wrong team for so long. Now you're just brainwashed like the rest of the sheep.,0
5040,These useless heaps of rubbish and their mates in the SAPS and among other ANC trough-snouters must be hunted down and disposed of.

Anthony Wiener was attacked due to sending a text with a picture of his penis in underwear in a private conversation.  Trump says he wants to sexual assault women and his daughter is a piece of ass. If Anthony was fair game  so is Trump.  Personal Responsibility is the main plank of the party Trump is endorsing.,1

5059,After over 30 years in the oil and gas business as a investor and a CEO  I can testify that Alaska has lots of oil wealth locked in the ground by the harsh and unreasonable oil & gas agency managers  the state legislature and the current Governor  but if corrected with a few changes then I feel Alaska's oil wealth can be unlocked.  If Alaskan voters change leadership in 2018  you we could unlock this oil & gas wealth then I feel everyone in Alaska would see the PFD check return to record highs and more!  This question right now is so simple  since "the House majority has clashed with the Senate's Republican-led majority over how to close Alaska's $2.5 billion deficit"!  Use the Constitutional Budget Reserve  it has well over $4 billion!   Let Alaskans vote for new leadership that will make Alaska less harsh toward fossil fuel workers and more favorable to the Alaskans that want more PFD oil money and no new taxes.   The state of Alaska has over $60 billion in the PFD and the CBR. VOTE!,0

He was 15 years old  and is now a multi millionaire being paid by hard working Canadians who do not agree with this decision. Shame on the Trudeau government for giving away Canadian money like its monopoly play money.,0
5070,But does anyone ever share 100% of your values?  I saw a video of someone walking through the streets of NYC asking people who claimed to be Hillary voters who said a particular quote  Hillary or Trump  then a somewhat shocking quote was read.  Almost everyone attributed it to Trump  yet they were Hillary quotes.  I take those things with a grain of salt because you never know how they are edited  but Hillary was anti-gay marriage until it became politically expedient for her in the past couple of years.  Hillary's campaign staff started the Obama birther controversy.  Hillary called black men "Super Predators".  I could go on.  Don't mistake this as me suggesting Trump has never done similarly stupid things  but are they really "values" if people are willing to set them aside to support a political party?,1
5071,The  best way to fight the NRA and their supporters to force guns on campuses is to flood Governor Walkers email and mailbox with anti-guns on campus letters of protest.  The governor will have the final say with his veto pen.  Get out of Alaska NRA and take your supporters with you.,0

5076,talor swift sucks,1
5077,pathetic that the left as usual accuses people of being racist for asking questions about immigration levels and the affect on our population or the carbon goals etc   seams you are incapable of countering his arguments with facts so the insulting game is on right? grow up,1
5078,I agree.  And be sure to tell them that you need to get up at 5 am for work.  They probably feel that 10 pm is not late  so you need to tell them that.  Toss in a compliment or two to sweeten the message  too.,0

5083,Like in Ferguson   it all started by Chris Brown  stealing a box of cigars to get high instead of going to school; events  we are not permitted to include that as part of the bigger picture . Similarly  Lewis doesn't like being reminded of his own feet of clay.,0
5084,Yeah  a lot of time and energy in wasting electricity  and creating nothing  unlike gold  which actually exists  and is tangible.  Meanwhile  paper money is merely based on debt. There is no intrinsic value to it. But  you can actually use that.  It's a suckers game. Let the fools part with their money.,1
5085,dumpy is so stupid.  let Obamacare fail without replacement - really dumb idea.  so he wants to throw 20 million covered by obamacare now off the healthcare rolls and let them suffer without a immediate replacement?  this is cruel.  this shows that dumpy does not care about poor people and is willing to see them suffer and die without medical care.  and many of those people voted for him.  how can they be so stupid too?  he should be impeached for attempting to govern only a small portion of the people  the rest can go to hell.  presidents should be concerned for all the people not just the rich and his friends.  yesterday  he proclaimed buy America but his and ivanka's companies all buy their stuff from overseas and will not change.  they get cheap prices but sell them for 10 to 20 times more  making huge profits and the expense of the American people.  such hypocrites.,1
5086,Oh please  try a little logic.  How else could you explain 3 women who didn't know each other or the perpetrator all suddenly going to police with similar stories of being raped in the same way by a stranger who looked the same except to think that there is a rapist on the loose?,0
5087,Could somebody please explain why it is SOOOOO important to make happy with Russia? Their economy is in the tank  killing their own fighting us in the war  siding with China   And by the way still communist. This is stupid is as stupid does!,1
5088,How true.,0
5089,This is "my" damn gym!".,0
5090,There is a bottom for the price of gasoline - or anything  for that matter - since there's a limit to how far you can cut costs and still be able to produce your product.  $.95 is almost surely below that point  but I could see it falling to the $1.50 area.  There's certainly pros and cons to both ICE and EV.  Up until now  the edge has clearly been to the ICE side (giving it something like 98% of all vehicle sales).  We agree that EVs are improving enough to cause a shift  possibly a rather dramatic shift  in the coming years.  But there's still some key drawbacks that have yet to be overcome  namely refueling and range  that will slow that shift down until they're solved.  But even a 10% market share by 2025 would still be a dramatic shift with continued growth on the horizon.  I think something like that could be a realistic target.,0
5091,Well  common sense would tell me that he would want to hold on to the gun so he would be in control of it. What if he put it down and someone ran up and took it (like one of the people fighting inside or anybody who just happened by). Does gun safety instruction encourage people to leave loaded guns unattended? If he became aware of the police  he could put the gun down and stand by it so as not to present a threat. He didn't know the cops were there because they sneaked up on him. What is truly indefensible is the police practice of parking away from a scene and sneaking up on people.,0
5092,No surprise  it doesn't at first glance sound like a good idea to rush into  let some other western countries be the first ones to do it  let's not quickly experiment if we don't know the health  crime and productivity outcomes.,0
5093,"This is EXACTLY the same"  Dressing up as someone who's black is the same as dressing up as a Nazi or a KKK member?  I'll bet that makes black people feel good.,1
5094,Funny how you gently handle some who criticize and snipe at others.....  Yes.  Do they not ask for donations during their fundraising efforts?  And the fact that you don't read many of the articles or authors limits your ability to validly critique the presentations  don't you think?,0
5095,Doubt you ever took Bio 101 at the college level. (Actually this is taught at the high school level) If you had  and paid attention  you'd know that not everyone is XX or XY. Genetecists also know  that even if  say XY  a screwup in utero with the amount of testosterone produced and released  can make someone who is XY  functionally female due to hormones.   The X and Y genes instruct millions of other genes how to perform.  Lots of ways that can go wrong.  Did you even know that there are XYs born without a penis. Most time everything works according to "plan"  but not always.  (This is a very dumbed-down explanation for you idiots living in the past.) I love when you MAGAphants try to act smart  and then continue to look like dumb lapdogs.  What a moron.  No fair crying about being called a name.  When you act like an uneducated  stupid  MAGAphant  moron  you're going to get called names.,1
5096,The controlling families have a long history of incompetence in running this company.  They survive just because they have French-Canadian last names.  This company would not last if it were headquartered in Toronto and was owned by the "Brown" and "Smith" families.  The Canadian government should have demanded that the dual share structure be scrapped.  The government has the power to prevent a take-over if they deem it in the national interest.,0
5097,I'll give it to you straight motely - as a racist  white supremacist  neo-nazi  etc.  you don't have the cojones to stand up and admit it. It's quite clear to the forum that your claim of "independent" is phony. You're an ongoing insult to humanity and deserve the labels of a hateful  cheap shot jerk.

While the actions of both groups may have left something to be desired  **ONE GROUP WAS FULL OF NAZIS.**  I don't honestly care a lick if the antifa or alt-left or whatever were yelling obscenities or waving bats or whatever  because the other group literally want to put Jews and homosexuals into f******g ovens.

5109,Hey  Junior Prime Minister! Why stop here? Why don't we just give them back everything  and then we'll ''lease" the parts we want. Probably significantly less expensive than today's arrangements  and they can do with the rest what they want! The more I think about it  the more I like it. Just like the San Jacincto Valley (Palm Springs  etc) in southern California. Every other mile square is owned by the Indians  and they lease it to the "newcomers" on 99 year leases. Every other mile square is owned by the newcomers. It all seems to work out. Do this with Canada and we can rid ourselves of a Federal Government  and just have a whole lot of local independent governments. Go for it Junior Prime Minister  I like the concept.,0

5123,Well the BCL do get a 5th term  as minority.  Just a matter of how long that lasts. before another election.  take a 2nd look at the Comox riding results so far  and the absentee ballot situation: minority BCL government is a reality  and BCL majority is still a real possibility.,0

I have never had a such desire to see an election over with  like I have with this one. We have idiots running for office  idiots talking about idiots running for office  and a media saturating us with idiot responses to idiot comments. In this election  the debt isn't an issue  the economy isn't and issue  and even the future has no relevance. This election  is about Miss Piggy  and Tax Returns  and Deplorable People  and 3 am Tweets  and Pneumonia  and now in the middle of it all Kim Kardashian has been robbed. I'm sure that will come into the debate in short order. The National Enquirer will be a good read while I'm sitting in the restroom relieving myself!,0

5144,Well of course you can't produce a video link of Trump according to you "standing behind Clinton  giving her the finger  and making humping movements" because none ever existed. What amazes me so is when those who tell lies are caught red handed lying and yet are stupid enough to double down on the first lie with more lies or some other such nonsense.   I'm betting psychologist will coin a new medical terminology for compulsive lying and call it the Hillary Syndrome.,1

5161,Except the numbers say most of you are wrong. People are watching these shows in strong numbers relative to our population. And the audiences are really loyal because they like seeing themselves and their country on the screen. Not every show is winner  but we don't get to make a dozen pilots and choose the best ones. So  just because you haven't heard of these shows  doesn't mean they aren't popular.   It's also important to dispel the myth that these are all a waste of taxpayer money. Most of these shows get small license fees from broadcasters and get most of their budgets from international sales. While labour tax credits often help to bolster the budget  tax credits are an overall win for the economy. Film & TV production is a huge boost to the economy.   So people are watching and it's good for the economy. What's the problem  Doyle? Oh  it's because people only read you  if you're negative. Bravo.,0

5165,Oh  hey Yepper et al. I like this version of your latest user name (● ● ● ●● ● ● •●•●•). Cute. A little more subtle than this one: 'Trump is a sick  fascist  white supremacist traitor. A worthless stain on America.'    Not trying to be offensive  but perhaps you should seek mental health assistance.  You've let Trump's election totally unhinge you and it's doing no one any good.

5169,Republicans in Congress  if you fail to substantively fix SS and Medicare I will lose all faith in you and turn Democrat for good. Cuts in revenue need to come with genuine cuts in spending as well  otherwise its not real fiscal conservatism. Say what you will about Democrats  but at least they have ideas about how to pay for their wasteful spending. Balance the budget!,0
5170,Proof you can't fix stupid!,1
5171,After reading all the ridiculous  and as usual  unhinged and twisted views by the dotards on state taxes  I thought maybe a simple history and current events lesson might be good. This deduction was established long ago because it  was believed that earned income should not be taxed twice.  So  let me ask all you dotards and morons this simple question:  Can you please explain your desire to eliminate the capital gains tax and inheritance tax because they are  "taxed twice"?  I hope you're being consistent.   You also may also want to look at the states with the best economies. Yes  they are generally high tax blue states.  You morons always want to attribute high taxes to welfare  but high taxes (especially property taxes) are evident in states with the best infrastructure  health care  schools  and regulatory programs (like environmental protection).    Class dismissed.,1

5176,HI:"But there is a reward at the end of it all: the higher the education attained  the more likely you are to be employed."  NO  The more pertinent your training is to today's(and tomorrow's) times  the more likely you are to be employed. Rob that thinking is so old school and in fact it's why parents shuffle their little darlings off to a BA in Greek Art.There is nothing wrong with Greek Art but  two years in college will get you employment. To  achieve self-actualization(Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs) get a higher education but a pay check is a little closer to the pavement.

5181,For all the bashing of corporate greed  we want inexpensive clothes and expect the equities in our RRSP's or pension plans to deliver good returns.  We hate it when the rich are greedy  but oblivious to when we are greedy ourselves.    The same people who chirp the loudest about climate change are the same ones fueling the exponential increase in air travel  oblivious to the fact that GHG emissions from airlines exceeds that for all of Canada (oil sands and all) by 25%.

5182,Yeah  that's the Iraq Resolution.  The AUMF was passed a month earlier  on September 14  2001.  They are two separate resolutions. The AUMF passed overwhelming. The Iraq Resolution  while it obviously had Democratic support  was largely passed by Republicans.,0

5188,"There is no statistical info to support this knife/hamer fallacy." [sic] . The FBI’s 2015 Uniform Crime Report (UCR) shows nearly three times more people were stabbed or hacked to death than were killed with assault rifles and shotguns (a.k.a.  the guns used in mass shootings) combined: . https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2015/crime-in-the-u.s.-2015/tables/table-20 . This UCR also shows that nearly twice as many people were beaten to death with “hands  fists  feet  etc.” in 2015 than were killed with rifles of ANY kind. . Whoops: I guess that's the bad part about facts: they don't care about your feelings.,0
5189,I hope that Trump hangs in there for awhile.  Right up to the 2018 elections at least.  Having congress totally controlled by the repubs is a serious problem that Trump will help correct.,0

5197,Dawna:  I think there are some commenters who have a genuine concern with reprisals for their posts.  I'm an old retired guy who posts what I feel and welcome anyone to disagree.  Sometimes I get nasty posts and anonymous letters suggesting I perform difficult  of not impossible  tasks upon myself.  However  others may be vulnerable at their jobs  in their church or neighborhood or whatever  and simply don't wish to take a chance.  I respect their feelings.    I taught for 28 years and  like every teacher I've ever met  can tell you tales of incompetent teachers who should have been fired years ago. Some blame the union ......I always blamed (and still blame) gutless administrators and school boards.  Everyone seems so frightened of "being sued" that they fail to support standards of performance and behavior....that's truly sad.  regards  Gary Crum,0

5201,I've been living in a European country where the ideal of a 14-year-old science student seems to be someone who knows the periodic table backwards and forwards. Those who are naturally interested  or quite diligent  are very good students -- and some educators in this country hold this up as proof that their system is head and shoulders over what they perceive as the ridiculously easy standards in middle schools in places like Canada. Next time I hear this talk  it will be nice to cite this report  then ask why so many kids in their country loathe science.  If Canadian students are doing a little less well in Math  it's doubtful that the "pressure cooker" approach -- so often urged by armchair critics of the system -- will help much.,0

5205,So  McCain is another apologist  just like Obama...here's some advice Mr. Sour Grapes that Trump did what you could not (win the presidency) SIT THE HELL DOWN AND SHUT YOUR DAM PIE HOLE!  You have become a hugh traitor to this country and God willing  you will be voted out of office next time you are up for reelection.  You do not speak for the people of this  country.

5208,It would appear le Monde does not concur. From their editorial today: This recurrence should both serve as a warning to the French of the precarious state of our democracy and trigger a forceful rejection of the FN  much like what we saw in 2002. For Le Monde  this response must be unambiguous. As we reiterated before the election  the National Front party is incompatible with our values  our history and our identity. For these reasons we must hope for Le Pen’s defeat and call on French voters to support Macron.,0

5211,Perhaps for tenured faculty  which are the minority.  I can assure you  from personal experience as sessional faculty (which out-number tenured faculty)  that I am correct.  With absolutely no job security from term to term  we are on an extremely short leash compared to the students we teach.,0
5212,Yes Kennie  too much population and building already in Honolulu.  Mauna Kea is a much easier place to attempt their control sovereignty political agenda.

5215,Ryan is operating from a naive approach to the budget that would have states raise all their revenue directly without federal assistance. Interestingly  the Great Recession demonstrated that states who were not afraid of raising property tax rates had no service interuptions while those that would not based on a conservative ideology fared poorly.  Health care reform primarily benefits the medical community. It makes sure they get paid and that their customers don’t die without their services. Single payer would be better  although it would force price cuts (cost cuts happen all the time to squeeze out more profit).  The taxes on the wealthy in the ACA come from a promise by Obama not to raise taxes on the bottom 98%. It would have been better to have a more general levy  which eventually must come with Single Payer.  I like that the bishops have come forward. Lacing the bill with Stupak amendment language did not deter them.,0
5216,You are ignorant.   Pity our country that people like you exist here.  Get out  work hard and find a better job.   Stop blaming others for the lack of success you have accomplished in your life you ignorant person.,1

5219,Here here Mr. Otness. Hodad I got 5gs that says your wrong about Trump. Put up or shut up...,0
5220,The other thing is - I question your understanding of practicality when it comes to tradesmen.  When you have several thousand dollars worth of portable tools  you have a three options with a pickup. Get a lockable cap for your bed  get locking storage boxes which you bolt to the bed (and there goes your ability to carry a sheet of plywood flat)  OR you use the back seat of your extended cab as a locker.   THAT is why vehicles like a Ford Transit or a Sprinter are becoming more popular. They are far more practical (especially for Canada where we have a thing called "winter"). They can keep tools secure AND have room for materials AND have a full length roof rack system for items like pipe  ladders  etc.,0

She really needs to get out of her parents' homes in order to mature. Her attitude will probably change dramatically if she does. She needs a push.,1

Trumps intervention saved the citizens of Hawaii allot of money.,0

5239,I don't advocate for theft (I tend to use more locks than most people do.)  However please don't be so lazy or idealist that you think people won't try to take the easy to grab items.  I'm actually concerned for the safety of many of my neighbors & their kids because they believe their kids & their property are safe (kids running around at 11pm at night  or leaving them locked out of their house for 8hrs a day) doors left open with no one at home.    I actually tried to keep an eye out on the above but someone had already been in &  out of their condo before I noticed the door askew. (They lost plenty and had to file an insurance claim) theft is so freaking common here you just file a dispute online with APD.   Based on some of these comments I have to wonder if it's risen because folks are still trying to act like its the 1950's-60s era.  Sorry but that time long passed. I see 8yr old thieves in stores nowadays & have to wonder if they're popping out the womb with a crowbar & a file,0

5243,Ontario transportation companies are regulated by the Commercial Vehicle Operators Registration (CVOR). Their ratings are directly attributed to their safety record. Many factors are involved. Accident rates  operator driving records  past infractions  safety check results  etc.  etc. Company insurance rates are determined by their overall CVOR record. It is in the company's best interest to make sure they are hiring and maintaining drivers who have proven excellent records  and for the most part  they do.,0

5250,First  moving the capitol (sp) would end nothing. It would mean that more legislators would live at home and take per diem. Second  every statewide meeting ever held in Anchorage allows the Anchorage area participants to go home at the end of the day and they have absolutely no investment in resolving the issues at hand. They would have year long sessions if they could. Third  you can make up examples all you want but when Jimmy Carter reduced the speed on our nation's highways to 55 the death rates went down. Did anyone care? NO. We like 30 to 40K people to die on our highways each year. If we reduced the speed on our highways to 5MPH there would be no deaths on our highways.  Why D's give 50M to Gov is easy...they are buying his favor. The Senate is as obtuse as the house...they can appropriate money in their budget for Troopers and roads - as much as they want ...saying that that particular $50M is to be sent that direction is politics that plays well with people who have no clue.,0

Bush administration that installed the first active solar electric system at the White House (Carter’s panels were largely symbolic  though they were used for heating water). In 2002  multiple solar grids were installed on the White House grounds. The installation was done quietly  with far less fanfare than Carter’s  but the panels provided energy to several White House operations.

5273,The son is not a victim he was engaged in illegal selling activity. He made boasts of large amounts of cash in the home and drugs.   This is why most successful drug dealers use banks and wash the money.  Most people don't want to put a huge target on their back.  I imagine that's why he had all the cameras set up at the house.  Though it didn't save his moms life.   Any idiot boasting of having large amounts of cash at home is saying "hey criminals I'm an easy target  why try robbing a bank when I'm so much easier"  Just stupid! He was dealing out of his damn home. His criminal stupidity is what made him a mark and got his mom killed.  Condolences that she passed but this is not victim blaming.  He's as much responsible for his illegal sales and bullseye comments as the stupid thugs who showed up to rob him.,1

5286,Oh what tangled web we weave  when first we practice to decieve!! The DNC rigs the entire primary process.  When they get caught they blame it on Russians hacking their emails. Then the DNC takes it further and claims they did so in collusion with Trump. Trump calls them on it and for good measure suggests to the "Russians" that as long as they are hacking the DNC maybe they could find the 30 000 emails Ms. HRC conveniently deleted when she came under investigation. So if a foreign entity takes Trump's tongue-in-cheek bait and turns up the 30 000 emails won't HRC be embarrassed??? And won't that be a can or worms for the FBI  and DOJ who gave HRC a pass because they claimed there was no evidence the basement bathroom server had ever been  hacked.   In the mean time is improving relations with Russia so bad? They were our allies in WWII. They actually have real capability for operating in the new  melting arctic (40 modern ice breakers compared to 2 aging vessels owned by the US).,0

5322,Something very interesting in this recovery plan.  Not sure where to find it out of the 213 pages but was watching a ch.2 news video about it.  http://khon2.com/2017/09/18/hart-submits-rail-recovery-plan-to-fta/ Fast forward to 2:20  and watch Gina Mangieri's segment.  She talks about O&M of rail.   For those who can't see the video   she goes on and says It costs $256 million a year to operate TheBus and Handi-Van  and fares cover only 27 %  so city budgets are used to covering the difference — about $186 million. The recovery plan says that by year 2036  the bus-and-rail will cost as much as $843 million a year with TheBus more expensive than rail in that number. Still just 27 percent is expected to be paid by fares  so taxpayers have to cover $615 million. That’s a difference of $429 million a year that the city’s operating budget will need to plan for. Very interesting.,0

5328,It is unacceptable to use chemical products on private property in such a way that it damages the economic potential and livelihoods of the adjacent farmers. Nobody has the right to maintain their tree plantations in economic production at the expense of the neighboring agricultural production on private property. It is wrong to produce your crop of trees by destroying your neigbor's crops.  Private property owners have solid rights against trespassers  and that should be applied to chemical trespassers also. You choose what you do to your own private property  but let others choose for their own property. Don't limit how your neighbors can make their own agricultural decisions.  Don't destroy or disregard the value of your neighbor's products or business. It's not yours to ruin.   Pandora's box of noxious weeds has been opened by the foolish yet profitable practice of clearcutting  and no spray cocktail can supress them fully. Now these weeds are evolving herbicide resistance...,1

Meanwhile  the commander of the US Pacific Fleet has stated he is ready to confront China. You reap what you sow....,0
5336,This is just another case of Liberals being Liberals. They have always acted as if they were above the law and they will never change.

5338,The nominating system is run by the political parties and is their way of selecting a candidate for the general election.  I don't "divorce" the two; they are entirely separate processes.  I have  on this site  condemned the DNC's treatment of Bernie Sanders.  With a fair process I think he would have been the Democratic nominee for the Presidency and  likely  be our next President.    Indeed  Oregon's "motor-voter" registration process makes it easy to be a registered voter.  You generalize by defining such individuals as "low information/now motivation" voters.  This  of course  isn't supported by the facts.  However  the long-standing GOP strategy to suppress the young  the poor and minority votes is well documented.  Short hours  long lines  few polling booths in heavily Democratic registered precincts.    Making it easier for people to participate in the democratic process is not "rigging" an election  it's promoting democracy.  Suppressing voter participation is  however  rigging,0
5339,If you had been watching the legislature and following what has been happening since SB21  you would see that this author along with this paper is part of a propaganda effort to take our PFDs and implement an income tax.

Judge: Oil companies 'cavalierly' wasted hundreds of millions on pipeline work  https://www.adn.com/energy/article/judge-says-oil-companies-wasted-hundreds-millions-pipeline-work/2014/03/01/  We are owed billions from audits after they were caught cheating on taxes  Dermot won't mention it.  Even after they were caught lying  he blindly trusts oil companies that they cannot make money at these prices and catapults the propaganda that the only way to fix the budget is to stick it to Alaskans.,0

5349,As much as I expect this is a cynical response. There is some evidence this could help. To some  extent this is a zero sum game.  This group has only so much money to spend on drugs. If there was easier access to best quality cannabis as a substitute for their primary drug of addiction. Cannabis is by far the safer of all of the drugs of recreation. By the way this includes alcohol and cigarettes. The same zero sum argument can be used for them as well for those at the lower  end of the income spectrum.

5352,Julie  the cost of medical services have exploded not due to capitalism  but instead  it is the socialization and government regulation of medical services that is the root cause of the problem.  Don't think for a moment that hospital services are controlled by private owners engaging in free trade. One of the most egregious examples are CON (Certificate of Need) laws.  CON laws limit entry and competition and create medical oligopolies and/or monopolies. Take some time to learn the difference between "crony capitalism" and capitalism.  Oligopolies and monopolies are typically brought to you via a symbiotic relationship between big government and big business.,0

5361,I do not refer only to taxes.  The contract with America was about government reducing government functions and costs  and increasing transparency. It was not about ensuring that the government worked equally well for everyone.  I'm not sure I agree about the income/wealth gap growing more under democrats than republicans  and that is a long discussion. It was assumed that the Reaganomics tax cuts would benefit everyone through "trickle-down" effects  which should have told everyone all they needed to know about the plan. At the same Reagan was building up the military and spending more on government than his predecessors. The gross national debt rose from $900 billion to $3 trillion between 1980 and 1989  a debt that became the responsibility of middle class and working poor American taxpayers. As Gerry Spence stated about Reaganomics  "the benefits trickled down  but the miseries were shared by the buckets full."   Thanks for your thoughtful and respectful response. I appreciate it.,0
5362,You have a long wait ahead of you  dummy.,1
5363,The amount of income targeted should always be after tax income. The amount of tax paid by most people 65 or older is significantly lower. The age tax credit and qualified pension income deduction are meaningful.  In my experience most people will be able to live very nicely with about 40% of their pre-retirement gross incomes. That amount will frequently be 55% to 65% of their  pre-retirement after tax incomes.  With no savings to budget for  zero to minimal debt interest to pay  no payroll deductions for CPP or EI   and lower income taxes to pay  how much income do you really need?,0
5364,Trump was correct when he said he could go out on the street and shoot someone and his supporters would still love him. His supporters hated Hillary so much that his claim would ring true and that is why we have this fool now sitting in the WH.,1
5365,And two unsustainable tax cuts that primarily benefited the already uber wealthy. When Cheney cast the tie breaking vote for the second round of deficit inducing tax cuts he infamously made the statement  "Reagan proved that deficits don't matter". True that. Deficits only matter when they can be used as cudgel against Democratic administrations. I've seen estimates that as much as 40% of the current deficit are because of those two tax cuts. Add in the ungodly war of choice against Iraq  zero funding for the Medicare Part D giveaway to PHARMA(close to $800 Billion) and zero funding for No Child Left Behind and you've got some pretty big numbers.,0
5366,You can go to third world countries all over that don't have basic infrastructure  electricity  running water  and they still have cheap reliable mobile phone service.  What we pay in Canada is absurd and a function of an oligopoly  pure and simple.,0

5369,Chicken little much  Rev. Schulz? Before the ACA  more than 40M didn't have insurance. After the ACA  that number dropped to 28M. Improvement  right? Sure  but people still couldn't afford actual health care. And people weren't ever dying in the 10s of millions due to lack of insurance  so what makes anyone think that that will all of the sudden start happening upon repeal? So no  nothing about your argument holds water. It makes you feel good  that's all. I'm all for increasing actual health care for people who currently lack access. All the ACA does is improve access to really expensive  social justice-acceptable insurance.,0

5377,Curt  I'm not sure what you being Native has anything to do with this discussion  but if you are indeed "a free thinker who studies subjects before making decisions " then you should be putting feelings and emotion as far back from rational  objective-based decision-making as possible.  In seeking truth as a "free thinker " you would no doubt hurt people's feelings in the process.   . Disciplining children also hurts their feelings-- neither of these instances makes you "a hater." You "hate" the people with whom you are saying are wrong as little as you "hate" your children for disciplining them.  "Hate" has nothing to do with it. . If you have an uncle suffering from Sexual ID Disorder/Dismorphia  then going along with their fantasy is about the worst thing you can do.  Study after study  medical group after medical group have come out against those families who entertain the fantasies of the mental disorders of their family members- specifically children.  This isn't about "hate.",0

That way  visitors might be fooled into thinking the loud rants and incoherent soliloquies are actually conversations with someone other than the one speaking.,0
5383,While I definitely get Manitoba holding back on signing this deal to try to get a better funding deal from the feds on healthcare   Christy Clark - who has taken next to NO new actions on combating climate change in BC since 2013 - only put up this "token" resistance of holding back signing  for one reason and one reason only - solely to try to curry votes for herself/party in the BC election next May!!  And lastly  Wall's faulty BS justification for vehemently refusing to sign - IS  identical to the one that Harper used successfully to take  NO actions on climate change for 10 years - that pricing carbon nationally in Canada is just too risky and WILL imperil our economic competitiveness  and we should do nothing??!!  Then why Wall  does BC with a carbon tax in place for years  have one of THE best performing economies in the country rather than one of the worst  eh??!!!,0

5425,If you want to have a civil back and forth argument without denigrating the other person  I am game.  But if you have no interest in listening to the other side and all you want to do is preach  then let's stop this conversation. Going by your own logic  then that would make Jamal Carter a poor substitute for T.J. Ward.  Ward has played against 1st string offense  game planned  executed at the highest level  won pro bowl nominations  started in a super bowl...you get my drift.  Carter on the other hand played with 3rd stringers against 3rd stringers.  Yet the team saw something and picked Carter over Ward.  That was NOT done in the QB competition. In an ideal and fair world  the only thing that would matter is "production and performance."  Not where you are drafted or who you know.  But we know that does not always happen. It is obvious that both of us will not see eye to eye on this topic.  Let us just agree to disagree.  After all is said and done  we are both Broncos fans.,0
5426,There is no place to hide  from nuclear radiation.  There is no place to hide  from a direct hit  from a nuclear missile.  There are not enough medical clinics  mobile hospital units  or hospitals  to support more than 50 000 sick or injured people.  There is not enough radiation medicine  for 1 million people.  There are not enough decontamination units  for 1 million people.  There is not enough storage space  for more than 50 000 bodies.  What exactly  is the shelter-in-place plan  or the evacuation plan?

5428,Indeed.The data show jailing people for longer does decrease violent crime  especially homicide. Take a look at Australia and the US since both had homicide peaks in the 1990's. Completely different directions on guns  one increasing them vastly (US) and one decreasing them vastly (Aus) but BOTH saw huge decreases in homicide. Both did do one thing exactly the same -- near triple incarceration rates. I'm originally from Baltimore. 93% of homicide perps  and 91% of homicide victims are prior criminals. 80% of homicide perps there have 10 or more priors. The places in the US where murder does not keep falling is where incarceration rates  are decreasing,0

5430,I find it disgusting to listen to all these hypocrites wailing about the loss of freedom of speech... while THOUSANDS of them sent very graphic and detailed death threats to Khalid for posting the motion... promising to laugh and her while she bleeds to death in the street.  IS that what we're talking about protecting?  IS that the civilized  free society you cherish so much?  I doubt every opponent of the bill here sent something to Khalid  but I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if one or two of you were involved in this behaviour.  Terrorizing an individual is no less a crime than terrorizing a group.  You may THINK you have freedom and right on your side  but if you use violence or even the THREAT of violence to silence your opponents  you are just as bad as ISIS.

5458,Ben   Why on earth does this story not reference the actual -rate- of homicide  which is the only meaningful way to describe changes in crime over time? This is Criminology 101 stuff yet  almost uniformly  I see journalists (and their editors)  who should be aware of it if they regularly report on crime issues  constantly drop the ball.  To my mind  journalism is about informing people of facts so their positions and choices can be rational and fully informed. How does leaving out the only truly meaningful way to judge variations in crime over time further that goal?  This click-baitey half-reporting is intellectually insulting and counter-productive to developing an informed citizenry.,0

5486,An equally egregious way that PET stabbed Quebec in the back was his tireless work when no longer in power to sabotage the Meech Lake Accord.  He hooked up (in more ways than one) with Debra Coyne the constitutional adviser to Newfoundland premier Clyde Wells to develop a way to scuttle Meech and it worked.  PET's giant ego could not tolerate Mulroney coming up with a viable way to recruit Quebec back into the federal fold with honour and dignity.  As a result  we came within one sell out crowd (51000 votes) at Olympic Stadium of losing the second referendum!  Virtually all of the provisions of Meech Lake are now in force through a combination of legislation  regulation and tacit adherence.  As with pretty much everything he did and tried to do on the economic  environmental  international and unity files  Brian Mulroney has been proven right and Trudeau 1.0 has been relegated among those of us who can discern our anuses from holes in the ground to be nothing but a horrible nightmare.,0

5513,Nothing here paints a clear picture of HPU's financial health. Freshman enrollment is up 10%? How many students is that? How many did they lose last year? It is not positive that almost a quarter of the student enrollment is new students; why aren't they continuing year to year? Too expensive? Poor facilities? Quality of programs? Also  HPU was supposed to revitalize Aloha Tower Marketplace to bring the community back. It looks like that effort has failed  which will be very disappointing to commercial tenants. Finally  it is a non sequitur to say that international students are enrolling "despite the anti-immigration policies implemented by the Trump administration." Foreign students come from Asia and Europe  not the countries covered by the travel ban. If those figures are holding flat at the reduced numbers that resulted from a strong dollar overseas  it doesn't say much for the university's success  particularly if HPU has discounted international tuition.,0

Yes I know a child can not purchase a firearm at  a big box store. It's the exposure of  the firearm. Just not the right venue. Just as retail sales of cannabis in big box stores is not the right venue. Regulated Gun shops for Guns. Regulated Cannabis shops for cannabis.  I support ones right to own firearms.

If you're like the vast majority of Trump voters  you are not making money off the stock market  so why is this important for your opinion of Trump.  Maybe you're finally realizing that all you Fox-watching lapdogs are being strung along for the benefit of the uber-rich.  Suckers!

5524,I agree with Jennifer  Smith. Raise the parking fines. It cost the government law enforcement and court system much more than $35 to process one citation. Not all fines are paid  some people request a hearing and the judge dismisses the case  in some situations a citation isn't issued because the vehicle is gone when the officer arrives. The true cost per 911 call is a lot lower than $35. Who pays the extra cost? The normal law abiding person probably pays more than the violator. The minimum fine should be $60. When was the last time the fines were increased? In the past ten years  how much has your property tax increased?,0

Bernie Sanders is the most popular politician in America largely because he's risen above "identity politics"  (losingly propagandized by Hillary Clinton) to unite all Americans who want change.      Sanders is the only politician who has an entire program of political and economic transformation to create a more prosperous and equal economy.

5546,Sanctimonious  You really ought to read up a little bit on history and you will see what nonsense your examples are. The democratically elected government of Iran back in 1953 (a constitutional monarchy) was overthrown because the supposed 'good men' of the CIA and MI6 did not approve of the government: The CIA did not like an active communist element in the population  and the British oil company (the predecessor to BP oil) refused to renegotiate the disproportionate split in oil revenues to benefit Iranians. The prime minister of Iran then nationalized the oil industry. Hence his overthrow (admitted by the CIA and MI6) and the installation of the Shah - brutal  profligate - until his overthrow by the revolution of 1979 when Komeini ultimately seized power by the killing of thousands of liberals etc. So much for the 'good men'. Many observers place the rise of ISIS at the door of Bush and Blair for their war on Iraq. North Korea? I think the good guys tried - Korean War.,0

5561,"The importance of focusing on systems is that they can be more easily changed than human nature". Yes  and this is and has always been my main point - we tend to want to always choose the easier (and most popular) avenue to critique a social problem. But a social problem is often more a psychological or cyclic psycho-social problem. I just believe we should be emphasising the old adage of "Dear God  change the world (or the Church) starting with me". If we always emphasis the 'systemic'  then we may be in danger of ignoring some of the more base causes for social problems...the individuals with deep unresolved psychological problems who get into positions of power. I just believe we need to always emphasis all three in any critique of any social problem (and include ourselves)  and not make it an us and them issue  otherwise we are in danger of scapegoating  and avoiding personal and social psychohistorical reality. Your right about the RC terms of reference of course..it's a start.,0

5580,Dear Dr Mackay. Mefloquine/Lariam is a scary drug. I have personally taken it back in the mid 1990's while travelling in Indonesia. I had to stop after one week of travelling there due to the intense nightmares and hallucinations that it was causing me. I have never experienced such vivid dreams or hallucinations either before or since then. They studied the drug in the US military and it is thought to have serious side effects. It was thought to have been linked to a far above average number of murder suicides at Fort Bragg  North Carolina and severe psychiatric side effects in military personel who first took it in Central America in the late 1980's and early 1990's. I personally believe these reports due to my own experience with the drug.   I think a Physician that completely discredits any reports of the ill effects of this drug need look a little deeper because the evidence is out there. I will not link anything but there is a fair bit of discussion about the medication online.,0

Bottom line your sorry ass should have been fired for disobeying NFL's prayer rule in the first place therefore Trump would have never said that to hurt your feelings. Your expectation of Trumps reactions are silly. You keep forgetting again and again  he is not a politician and he speaks whatever on his mind. Just like we do!!

I directed the poster to the letter and the part where the Cardinals specifically say the polar opposite - i.e. That they want 'yes' or 'no' to each of the questions and NO "theologising."  I'm still waiting for the poster concerned to apologise. He simply went off and started the same uninformed cr@p with someone else. Trolls  all of them.,1

Like allowing Sikhs  and only Sikhs  to ignore a law requiring motorcycle riders to wear helmets?  Yes  nice religious neutrality. Good thing we have the G&M to teach us what is acceptable and what isn't when it comes to secularism (or rather  laïcité - which is different).  Quebecers are wary of outwardly religious candidates because it gives the impression that their religion colours their politics.  In the case of Mr. Singh  that impression sounds correct. He has a record of allowing his faith to taint his politics. We haven't thrown the nuns out of our hospitals and schools to start electing them in government.,0

5621,Let's properly identify the PFD - it is state welfare. It is not given based on need.  It is not prorated to one's circumstances. It distorts family behavior.  It is a disincentive to industrious behavior.  The L48 came to those conclusions when it approved Federal Welfare Reform in 1996. Yet some Alaskan legislators persist with the myth that the PFD is sacrosanct. Government has no business giving money to all citizens. Indeed  government has a responsibility aiding those physically or emotionally disadvantaged  but the ubiquitous PFD is foolish and incredibly wasteful.  It gets even more outlandish when the legislature considers a broad based tax.  Consider if you will the government distributing PFDs through one agency and collecting your new taxes through another new agency.  It is absurd.,0

5625,Well  congrats to the Astros  but for Dodgers fans  plenty of blame to go around. First  Cody Bellinger with the strikeouts. And though seemingly minor  his first inning error  where he cut off a ball headed for the 2nd baseman  then botched it; he did that several times. Did no one think to address that? Bellinger’s error granted Darvish some grace  which proved to be the dagger.  The team 1-13 with RISP. Seager  Turner  Bellinger  and Puig  the rest as well  but those guys just failed to deliver  the core of your team.   Many Dodgers fans felt they should have started Kershaw. You can make the case that Roberts should have yanked Darvish at the first sign of trouble with the score only 2-0  that he left him too long out there. I among them  wanted him out.   The Dodgers of course will bring back Dave Roberts but I have no confidence in him. Don’t sign Darvish  but do not let Kershaw opt out after next season like Greinke opted out. Kershaw may want to test the waters now.,0

5649,Fair enjoy  but if you are an employee  you get a whole lot of other "perks" that self-employed people do not.  You get a paid vacation.  You get employment insurance in case you get laid off  or sick  or pregnant (note: self-employed people can opt in to parental leave  but most don't because you still need to run your business).  And your employer contributes more to the employment insurance premiums than you do.  And  if you do take parental/maternity leave  we even have to guarantee you your job back - so we effectively "pay" you and hold your job.  We also match your CPP contributions.  Maybe some employees should consider all the benefits that they do get  instead of the one thing they don't get.,0
5650,As the fish farming grows world wide  as it will  consumers care about prices and availability more than philosophical arguments by fisherman.  Alaska can and should continue to focus on the quality of wild salmon. Alaska is not going to stop the farming in the rest of the world becasue we do not like farmed fish.  There is a segment of the population who will continue to seeks the best quality available regardless of price.  Those buyers are the exception not the rule.   As I see the situation  it is parallel to the fast food industry.  There are low priced fast food joints on every corner of most cities.  There also is a place in those cities for the white table cloth restaurants.  The customers of either are there becasue of price and service.  The preponderance of fast food places overwhelms the white table cloth places  serves as evidence that price not quality is what drives the vast majority of  customers through which door.,0
5651,In essence we already have the practical version of that. If someone is convicted of a crime punishable by more than a year's imprisonment  even if they are not sentenced for that length  they become a legally prohibited person.  But people are arrested for DUIs and have the charges dropped for lack of evidence all the time  to deny a legally innocent person the exercise of a fundamental right based merely on arrest  without any due process  is not "reasonable."   The only reason revoking a person's license for misdemeanor mala prohibita DUI convictions passes either state or Fed Constitutional scrutiny is because driving is legally considered a privilege  not a right. Given that possession is the core of the RKBA  and statistically very few people ever convicted  much less arrested  for a DUI  particularly a first and only offense  ever go on to commit other crimes  there's no way that would pass Constitutional muster.   It's a Right  that's the starting point for discussion.,0

5671,It is not hidden unto those that look for it  Christy.  The problem is that it is no longer taught unto the children as unto a basis of factual history  rather than redefined history.  I shall bet that the vast majority of school "teachers" teach their own students that it is the Republicans that supported slavery  and it was the Democrats that freed them  as well as teaching them that Abraham Lincoln was a Democrat  rather than a Republican.  What our kids are learning today is revisionist history  based upon the social beliefs and ideology of those that are conducting said courses  rather than the actual truth.  The NEA is a disgrace  both unto the children they pretend to teach  and unto themselves as "educators".  The Liberals/Marxists are a disgrace  both unto the populace that they claim to represent  but truly do not  and unto themselves  as the charlatans they are.

The documents originate from FBI and CIA series identified by the Assassination Records Review Board as assassination records.  More releases will follow.  To view the entire file  you may visit the National Archives at College Park and request access to the original records.  https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/2017-release  I assume you jumped right on it and started your research  …right?  Trump is just showboating.,0
5674,Oh  then why did Clinton get close to 2 million-and possibly more--votes than Trump?  Doesn't sound like a mandate to me. Sounds like a lie perpetrated by a con artistist and his thugs.,1
5675,Oh  quit sucking on mufflers and get a job.,1
5676,"This  of course  presumes their consciences are well formed" The problem is that many people do not have a psychological need for creedal absolutism  so the number of candidates for successful indoctrination is limited.  They will be the smaller  holier Church  of course.,0

5678,I would much rather keep our supply management system and be assured of product safety and self sufficiency.  Has anyone thought of the possible effects of the decimation of our dairy industry?  It is always prudent to be able to feed one's own country.,0
5679,Yup  My Opinion. You hit the nail on the head. Man has decided that the world revolves around him. He has now named his new dynasty: The Anthropocene Era. This self-exaltation (There is no power in the universe greater than the power that I possess.) is indicative of the religion of secular humanism. That is the cult that is ushering in the new world system that is currently outlined by the UN. Google "Agenda 21". It's not a conspiracy theory. Cap and trade is only the beginning. Blame man for the weather and make him pay a penance tax. I don't want to spoil the rest of the story here. Globalism is at your door step. And you have to bow as it walks in...,0
5680,Mr. Dela Cruz uses words such as awkward  rare  done before  but it does happen  no political dealmaking  or anything like that. I wonder what Mr. Dela Cruz meant when he said " or anything like that " Does that mean rewarding companies that have contributed to some of the lawmakers campaigns. Tax payers have got to keep an eye on this guy Dela Cruz as he is certainly one slick character Be also very interesting to see what legislators received campaign contributions from Pacific Well Digging. The project is a good one and the people of that area deserve some assistance although they do not have to live where there is no water.,0

5685,This is the same trend as the ETF vis Mutual funds. It is CLEAR  crystal clear that the indexes are better doing than managed funds. THE FUN AND RELATED income WHERE FINE FOR THE yoyo 50  60 and 1970 years. Nobody cared since the boomers were not yet at the receiving end. Straight talk; The mutual funds have been grabbing about 50 % of the income of the funds every year. If you had extra capital gains   you were lucky. But taking 50 % of the dividend and interest income of a fund makes only the fund seller and advisor very rich and leaves the client with HALF a pension out of investments. It was a great idea but a scam. Taking from the ASSETS a % that came out around 50% of the yearly income. A well planned scam. But a legal scam  a sKimming. No wonder we prefer to work with discount brokers and invest in ETF s at low  very low cost. This Mutual thing will experience a disruption of immense consequences for having for far too long taken too much for doing less.,0
5686,sometimes I like to poke the bear  boy are they touchy!,0
5687,Voting for Conservatives mindlessly  for four decades  is a bad thing. It reminds you of dictators who win every election with 99 percent of the votes. Corruption sets in - Alberta has very strong and unethical ties between business and government.,0
5688,Global Warming is a religion with all of the expected zeolots trying to destroy the US economy.     First Global Cooling  then Global Warming. Ahh what the heck  let's just call it Climate Change so we can cover every change in weather.   Soon everyone will be part of the Communist Church. Heretics will be punished for not being believers.  That by itself  is enough to make me be a skeptic.    What happen to our country?,0
5689,' Hilarious   You were doing ok when you talked about Buckley.  After that?  Not so much.  Ronald Reagan presided over some of the worst crimes this country has perpetrated.    Moral decorum?  Iran/Contra ring a bell?  Did you forget the 85 indictments handed down to his henchmen?    Arms trading?  The invasion of Grenada?  …I'll stop there  not like there isn't lots more.   The Bush duo?  Moral decorum  you say?   I'm pretty sure moral decorum means something else than what you've attributed to it.,0
5690,This is what being a criminal  repeatedly  and not changing gets you.  I see no problem with his sentence other than we should probably just execute him for being utterly useless to society.,1
5691,Yes  yes  Og  all graduates of Wharton Business School who become multi-billionaires and then president of the US without any prior political experience and with the combined might of the Democrats  the MSM and the polling industry totally and almost insanely against you are incompetent morons.  However  I was responding to the poster who thought he was insulting Trump by comparing him and his managerial style with George Steinbrenner's by presenting ACTUAL FACTS about the former Yankee owner's incredible performance.  Sorry if actual facts offend you.  You should ally with characters like Shore in fighting for a fact and logic free safe area here exclusively for the left wing lunatic fringe.  And if you can't make that fly  just obsessively spend your time getting the really good conservative posts deleted.,1
5692,Trumpatito.  He's orange as a big Cheeto.  With hands as big as a mosquito.,0

5694,And watch the liberal hypocrisy fly.,1
5695,Trump is such a vile  repugnant semi-human.  Glad he's taking down the Republican party  but the stench he's leaving in his wake is going to take some time to clean up.,1
5696,I'm happy it is out of the hands of law enforcement for the most part  even thought those networks will find something else to smuggle.      Old Soul takes a beating by conservative posters on this site.   He's outnumbered when it comes to the regulars.   I like him  he's got spirit and a good heart.   He is pretty defensive  but most of us would be if we were defending a minority opinion.  We certainly have writers on the far right that are just as belligerent .    It's all good.  I've never had a posting censured  but I've received multiple warnings about taking away my privileges because the computer doesn't like my decisions on the civility quiz.     If an editor is listening.  The 'group' determines those standards - correct?   So how are my rating 'out of the norm' if the editors have not already determined their desired level of civility?   Am I too tolerant?  Am I too strict? You are not explaining why you believe I might deserve to lose privileges?,0
5697,If you give Nadal say 3 French Opens  his total major count would be 8 and that ranks as top 10 major winner of ALL time.  And he is still playing seeking to win another (non French) major.   That can hardly be considered a "solid player".  Nadal is one of the all time great tennis players that has ever played the game with the second most winner of majors by any player in the history of the game.  Boris Becker was a "solid player"...,0

5704,You can't have it both ways.  If  in your opinion  the world is on the eve of destruction  and that climate change  if left unchecked by massive global intervention  will result in the end of civilization as we know it  then the only responsible action in regards to international tourism is to make it illegal.  Patting the industry on the back for a 10% reduction in CO2 emissions  simply means that 90% of otherwise avoidable CO2 emissions are still being added to the devastating effects of Global Warming   If you truly cared  you would strive to make that number zero....  Those whose jobs were effected could simply move to the country and partake in sustainable  organic farming using windmills and solar power.  Or....we could just live our lives as per normal and be done with the SJW virtue signalling.,0
5705,We have a firearms death rate that's eight times higher than Canada. Think about that. It's twenty-seven times higher than Denmark. I'm not sure these statistics even count all police homicides.  Firearms deaths have increased to a point now where they're matching or exceeding automotive deaths  which I suppose  when you think about it  makes firearms a bigger public safety concern than drunk driving  and look at all the stops they've pulled out over that issue.,0
5706,Well done CIBC and all the other banks too!  It might have caught CIBC short sellers off guard  as there seemed to be a short squeeze on the U.S stock market. If you check out google finance for CM on the New York stock exchange as of Nov. 25 there were over 19 000 000 CM shares shorted representing 37 average days (515 000 shares approx. daily) of trading. Today over 5 000 000 shares traded hands as the U.S. price rose 3.44% and hedge funds there seemed to be covering their short positions. They also will have to cover the dividend payment in January if they hold on to the stock.  Looks very good for the banks going forward.(I still don't like Trump but not as bad as before the market turned around),0

5712,Since the evidence is in Germany  one wonders whether this imitation of Elliott  Ness and "The Untouchables"  in Ontario is an attempt by the government to divert attention from its own trials  one for bribery in North Bay and the other for destroying evidence in the gas plant cancellation scandal.,0
5713,The real Trump came out to play.  While being investigated for treason  Trump decides he's going to support white supremacists.  David Duke of the KKK knows where Trump stands   …and so does everyone else.  In a truly disgraceful display of not knowing anything about America    Trump proves he's the disgusting figure of a fascist he hopes he can be.  Nazi sympathizer can be added to the list of descriptives of Trump.  Petty con man  buffoon  traitor  white supremacist  nazi sympathizer.  Pick one  they all work for Trump.,1
5714,"Trump is not yet president." Right. But he can't keep his mouth shut or stop behaving like a ten year old brat with lots of money. He's mentally unstable  morally bankrupt  and dangerous. He'll finally have to work at this job. His thinning hair will not turn grey  it will always remain "orange terrific"  like a plastic carrot. At least he'll get the attention he craves.,1
5715,Liberal hypocrisy will have hit peak performance when they start calling her a genocidal baby killer,1

5717,I could care less what you belive sir. Carry on libtards,0
5718,You point is so immoral and ridiculous.  Heaven forbid  a company creates jobs.  The tourism industry is the only optimistic industry Alaska has left (besides government spending).  Heaven forbid a company making a profit.  Heaven forbid people wanting to work.  Heaven forbid someone wants to come to Alaska and spending money into the local economies from Ketchikan to Fairbanks.  Shame on you.  Your mindset is equally as bad as a racist.  Its a mindset that is bigoted against businesses.  If conservatives want to win against liberals  we have to call them out. Their arguments are always morality based  lack logic  and never about personal responsibility and freedom. They are punitive against businesses  seem to enjoy mediocrity  and enjoy nothing better than to tell others what to do  many times under hypocrisy.,1
5719,tip2  Costs up 21% in a market that's risen by 40%  since launch and still rising ???  Think you've answered your own question.

5720,Funny  most liberals I know make 6 figure incomes  but hey don't let facts get in the way of a cool narrative  Trump doesn't  why should you?,0
5721,One of the reasons I voted for Trump was because Clinton was such a career criminal and liar. It didn't take me long to see that Trump is trying to outlie her. Anyone with half a brain can see that.,1

I was on the border for 9 months and never once fought against any member of the ANC. The fighting was done by SWAPO  Cubans and East Germans. The ANC was 200km further back fighting each other in their Quatro base.   It is this fallacy that the ANC won the struggle that has led to the impunity with which we live today.,1

5729,Economic catastrophe is a straw dog set up by so-called energy corporations to kill emission regulation with the approval of ignorant citizens who fear job loss. It is a fraudulent argument  because there are more jobs per KWH in renewable energy than in resource extraction  and those job are more stable. At this time the cost of solar and wind electricity is at near parity with fossil fuel generation. So how can you call that "bad energy policy"? It seems you are arguing backwards from a forgone (and fraudulent) conclusion.,0

This planet has has literally thousands of people working on all 4 areas the governor wants looked into. If you want an answer to any one of them all you have to do is open a page and read for 5 minutes. George  hes pandering to you.

5744,Time for a new razor blade.  Your edge is uselessly dull. The Clinton campaign have lied from the start stating that they had nothing to do this fake dossier. They financed it.  This fake dossier was the basis for the FBI getting into investigating the Trump Campaign using their false pretense to spy on a political opponent. Your idiotic statement  “trump likes to be peed on” neglects that he is a germ-a-phobe. You are telling on yourself.  The Russians have all the leverage they needed but on Hillary who they paid 145 million bucks to obtain 20% of our strategic uranium supply. It goes all the way to Obama.  They have sold out this country... the house of cards is tumbling.  You have been played.     The headline is TRUMP WAS RIGHT... AGAIN.,1

5752,I said that the Council would appeal  but that isn't satisfying. I no longer think anyone will challenge them in Court. The "leadership" is not going to sue its club. This makes Alaska the only State that has 4 branches of government: Executive  Judicial  Legislative  and now the full time "interim" Legislative Council that does anything it thinks it can get away with every day of the year.,0
5753,Why are you so caught up in the word “sport”? I have never heard a hunter say  “I love the sport of hunting.” They say  “I love hunting.”  You can call hunting murder if you want. I guess you are a vegetarian  good for you!  It does not bother me at all that you think I am a sociopath.  Again you have your terms messed up.  See us dumb hunters are not very bright  but calling us sociopaths is not exactly Rhodes Scholar territory either. Now check me if I am wrong but  a sociopath has an extreme disregard for people.   I think you need a different term as killing people is not the point of hunting.  Again  check me if I am wrong  I am going by freshman sociology from 30 years ago  but you may want to go with ‘Psychopath.’ A psychopath is basically a sociopath but with a mental disorder. Perhaps with some violent or aggressive behavior.  Is that what you were going for or did you want to slant more towards cruelty to animals? Let me know!,1

5756,UTTER GARBAGE !!,1
5757,The so called "clean energy" is not clean and is unable to provide energy when needed. The three main forms of "clean energy" are wind turbines  solar panels and biomass. Wind turbines only provide energy when there is the required amount of wind. When there is not enough wind or when there is too much wind  wind turbines do not provide any energy at all. However when they are providing energy  industrial wind turbines  most of which are 500 ft tall  kill birds and bats by the thousands. The manufacture of magnets for industrial wind turbines creates major pollution problems in China as does the manufacture of solar panels. Solar panels only provide energy when there is sunshine. Ground based solar panels require massive use of herbicides to suppress plant growth.  Wind and solar require large scale construction of power lines to connect them to the grid. Biomass is the burning of wood chips  currently supplied by cutting down forests. "Clean energy" is an environmental disaster.,0

Now the naively stupid voted in your boy to finish the job.,1
5761,That's not the way it works.  Universities have their attendance regulated by governments  because governments provide subsidies.  International students are a profit centre that allows more money to be spent on other non-regulated things (wages  admin positions  sports  etc.)  but not on admitting more domestic students.    I can't speak about the quality of domestic students who can't get in  but I can speak from experience that the quality of many international students is weak.  They will get C- or D  then plead for a higher mark because they are international students who pay so much and need a higher GPA to remain in the program.,0

5772,Mr. Ostler:  You are ever-so-right.  I'm 74 and remember Presidential campaigns back to Eisenhower-Stevenson.  If you took all the lies told by all the Presidential candidates since that first 1952 campaign  you'd still be far short of Mr. Trump's total.  However  it seems his supporters simply don't care if he lies.    Ms. Clinton is not a paragon of veracity  but  as you note  Mr. Trump's ability to  with a straight face  repeat lies which have been documented as such  is truly amazing.  It's reached the point where "Trump lies" are hardly newsworthy...it would be like announcing that "the sun rose in the East this morning."  FROM WIKEPEDIA: "Pathological lying (also called Ilgoniusbahus and mythomania) is a behavior of habitual or compulsive lying.[1][2]"  Judging from his behavior  there's at least the possibility that Mr. Trump is a mythomaniac suffering from advanced Ilgoniusbahus.    Could someone explain to me why he lies when everyone  including him  knows he's lying?,0
5773,I'm sitting out this season.  The NFL is an asylum run by its inmates and those inmates have decided to abuse their positions as a personal political podium in such ways that any of us would get fired if we did the same.

5790,Yours is the most ignorant comments.,1
5791,In reading this  and the way that AG Chin has put this out  I am smelling that this is as much about standing on principal as it is political grandstanding. The vast majority of visitors to Hawaii come from Asia. Joining Minnesota  which by the way has much higer stake in this as a good deal more of their population is from the affected countries  most notably Somalia  the effect of our state having any bearing on the overall discussion of this temporary travel ban is minuscule in both our voice in effecting change and the fact that any of this affects our state at all.   As mentioned by ThirdRock  our AG (and  by direct association  our Governor) should focus on more immediate problems here.,0

5799,Fake news -- ROFL  nothing more than Trump mimicry. Maybe someday you'll  learn of the research performed by serious journalists prior to publishing  and recognize that when mistakes are made  the stories are retracted unlike Trump whose chronic lies are never retracted as he knows his supporters don't care about truth.,0
5800,Even if that WERE true  which it's not  I'll just take mine now  rather than let the government continue to raid it. At least I'll get the interest on it. Either keep Walker's hands off my PFD  or cash me out now.,0

The ones seeking custodial care sure don't:  only 1 in 5 are "allowed" to be covered  since one must demonstrate they have little to no income or assets to qualify for that little reward. . The ones seeking home-based care sure don't: It is all but impossible to get Medicare to allow it  and home care providers don’t much like this benefit either: since the government (once again) imposes their own cost pricing  providers don’t make much money on it  and under new Medicare rules  they can actually lose money providing such care. . The ones seeking vision  hearing  and dental coverage sure don't love it:  Most of these services aren't covered  as well as countless lifesaving drugs under Medicare Part D. . http://www.medicareadvocacy.org/the-promise-and-failure-of-medicare-home-health-coverage/,0

5813,Nathaniel Herz and the ADN are full on liars !!!!!!!1  Nathaniel Herz is a LIAR !!!!!  Nathaniel Herz and the ADN are LIARS  The income Tax actually uses the IRS tax system to insure that wealthy people and Corporations and businesses don't have to pay taxes  or pay much less.   Stop lying to the readers !!!!!!       BOTH the Republicans and the Democrats are working for the rich.  The Democrats just want a slightly less regressive tax.  The only fair tax is a flat sales or income tax that makes people pay an equal percentage of their income.  If you receive economic benefit from the society  which makes I possible  then you pay a small percentage of the gross income.  Supe poor people would be excluded.  It's the only fair way.  Until that is the law of the land.  It's corruption across the board  and the Republicans and Democrats are filthy.,1

5815,Get real. Everyone is over the fact that trump won.  What we are still amazed at is how completely illiterate he is. How every word he utters is complete fantasy. How his vocabulary is equal to a well trained horse.  He's just complete garbage and it's quite amazing to see dim bulbs still supporting this clown.  Disclaimer - If I were American I would have voted for this clown over the better disguised evil that is Clinton  but I would find it impossible to support him after all his grade school level nonsense.,1
5816,Excellent investigative journalism again. Thank you.  Please do it again.,0
5817,"Analysis of the post election results show clearly that the less educated  regardless of income  voted for Trump."  The same analysis also showed that the median income for Trump supporters was higher. So the dumb  more affluent presided over the educated  less effluent  er...affluent. Hmmm...makes me want to apply to grad school.,1
5818,I agree with your view that the Alaska Democratic Party doesn't give a damn about what Alaskan Democrats want.  Why they would vote for Joe Miller  who has shown himself to be a liar  cheat  and hypocrite is beyond me.  Lisa Murkowski is the candidate with the proven record of working for Alaskans.,1
5819,As stated in my response  I don 't want my name on the building.  I am quite productive and don't need any proof of that.  Don't need a plaque.  Just pointing out that your argument is bogus.  Thank you also for making my point that giving them money is not the answer.  Marcus gave them no money.  Also  for pointing out that Marcus' name is ONLY A PROPOSAL.  They are still "THINKING" about that.  We shall see if it comes to pass.,0
5820,I don't know what to say about civility  but compromise is  in my opinion  a rare condition usually only brought about in the face of imminent disaster. Take  for instance  the recent conclusion of the legislature. The budget passed  and now signed  could be called a compromise of sorts  but it does nothing to address the State's dire financial crisis. I'm not agreeing with one side or the other as far as 'fixes' are concerned  but I'm just pointing out that it took to impending disaster (opinion) of state shutdown to bring a budget to the governor.  This seems grim. However  I have some faith yet that people of all persuasions can and will do what's right when the time comes. Americans have reliably done so for 200 years (minus that 1860 incident) and I trust they will into the future. Until then  *civil* disagreement is okay  and part and parcel of a healthy democracy.(yes  I know  a republic  with the representatives popularly elected  so  a form of democracy.),0

Of course  where we should go for "the facts" about Trump is Breitbart or Infowars or  better yet  his Twitter feed  right  bav?

5836,Canada is golden because Trump has alienated so many people and governments that to go after Canada now is the last thing he would want to do. I think.   The only potential wrinkle is an article in the Daily Beast a few days ago that is making the rounds it seems and  has as its topic that statistics show that the Canadian border is more of a threat to the U.S. now than the Mexican border is.  Demanding that Canada pay more for national defense is a given although there may be nothing happening with specifics tomorrow and the day be little more than further meets and greets. Trudeau may get a bigger than usual rock star welcome because he is being sold as the antithesis of Trump and  no one really knows much about the man and what really goes on in Canada beyond TMZ coverage.  As I've written elsewhere  a large majority of Americans have a positive opinion of Canada  think of Canadians as friends and have no idea of the level of hate and bigotry being directed at them.,0
5837,Did you watch that game? Cousins didn't have any starting tackles in the game after H1  yet he still threw perfect balls.  "PHILADELPHIA — Facing one of the NFL’s best defensive fronts  the Redskins’ offensive linemen had a long  physical night and now have a short week in which to recover. With two linemen inactive and four of the five starters missing at least some plays in Monday’s loss at Philadelphia due to injury  Washington was forced to use all its available linemen.  “We’re not using the injuries as an excuse. They just played better than us today ” Redskins Coach Jay Gruden said."  https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/football-insider/wp/2017/10/24/scherff-mri-tuesday-as-injury-riddled-redskins-offensive-line-suffers-another-blow/?utm_term=.b174e9ced6c1,0

The actual quote from him  which has been widely reported  is "“He reached out to his friends in the legal community  got the best possible lawyer and was very confident that he was going to be able to make those charges go away " yet you conclude that he didn't hire a lawyer and must have interfered with the administration of justice? That's quite a leap.,0
5840,Sure. Everybody you dont approve of is a rapist and a racist. How predictable.,1
5841,Guess this clown forgets that Monica was a willing participant.  No comparison.  Trump and Weinstein both made advances at women who clearly said no or asked them to stop.  Big difference Corey.  But you’re a man wtf do you know about being sexually harassed?  Obviously  nothing.  Furthermore  in case any of you have forgotten Hilary was running for office not Bill.  And Trump has been nothing but a national disgrace and embarrassment to the United States.  Stick that in your cap and smoke it Corey.  Wait  weren’t you fired by Trump?  I’d wipe that brown dukie off your nose!,1
5842,Why are 8 of the top 10 richest American's liberals?,0
5843,Yes  it's true that many businesses (in particular small  service-based labour-intensive businesses like restaurants and retail stores) are based on a premise of low-cost labour. And yes  they should pay their workers a fair wage. The problem is the timing. It's very difficult for a restaurant owner to hike prices for food and drinks in lock-step with the wage raises without customers noticing and buying less or coming less often. If it is done more gradually  it isn't a shock to the system  keeps consumer demand steady  and creates a win-win for all.,0
5844,I'd imagine that the un-emoyment rate of these classy fellas is through the roof. Too much time on their hands  that's for sure.

5890,Boraas once again proves why he is part of the problem with the liberals that infest out university system.

5891,I prefer that politicians keep their person beliefs out of politics and justifying their political actions by the use of any kind of "holy" book.

That is about as unAmerican as you can get.  Tyrany of the rankest sort.,0

German prosecutors said they saw no prospect of success in continuing to investigate.,0

5931,OK  now let me see if I've got this right.  When your boy Carlyle was the coach  everybody and his brother absolved him of any blame  it was almost all on the players  think I got that right.  Now  totally different.  Now it's on the coach to set the standard and provide leadership.  Pray tell  why the 180?  Oh  and Werenski got a pt last night too  as his team won it's 16th in a row.  Guess their coach is setting the standard and providing leadership.,0

5936,I expect as much silence on this as they had on tRump's p***y grabbing tape. The left tends to have principles on this - witness how they reacted to Weinstein vs. how the right reacts (meaning  virtual media silence) to O'LIElly  Murdoch and pResident P***grab.   Remember: tRump was caught  on tape  BRAGGING ABOUT SEXUAL ASSAULT. And they still voted for him.   Anyone that watches Faux and voted for tRump is a flaming hypocrite if they only rear up on their hind legs and start bleating about Weinstein now. Remember  O'Reilly's sexual harassment was known about for more than a decade  at least for anyone not deep in denial. He's not called Falafel King for nothing.,1
5937,We will always be playing the US's game.  It is the golden rule:  the one with the gold (the economic clout) makes the rules.  If the US doesn't like a negotiation  it picks up it's  ball and goes home.  Witness the TPA.,0

5958,Circumstances  indeed.  I understand your post  Lazeelink  and your terms like "I think that is a reasonable consideration " and "considering the circumstances" are haunting ones. "Reasonable" has the sense of minimizing damages   of justifying the separation of parents and children. "... considering the circumstances" is an invitation to examine what the circumstances really are  and how the U.S. got here.  This policy  though not disconnected from earlier policies with respect to residents illegally residing in the U.S.  found its support in the rhetoric of rape and other violence  a campaign clearly designed to build on fear and hate of certain groups who are  in general  dark skinned.  There is also the matter of where to begin the expulsions ... the priorities for removal. It raises images that remind us  "Western civilization has been here before." It begs the question  "Where do people think this will end?" And  of course  "Who is Canada in all this?",0
5959,This is just another reason to have the RCMP watched at all levels.  They  in my opinion  cannot be trusted.  It takes gall to have everyone swallow Duffy being charged with taking a bribe and Wright 'not' being charged to giving the bribe.  Do they think everyone is stupid or what?  Those crocodile tears apologizing to those accusers when he poo pooed them months before.  Blatant hypocrisy!,1

5967,I hear the liberal hypocritical brains exploding as I type.  Woot Woot!,1
5968,nope  you are being ridiculous.  your stats are totally wrong  not valid in Hawaii.  very few people own cars over 10 years  majority of the cars on the road was less than 10 years old.  parts for old cars are hard to get  so most people will not keep old cars.   also  the average homeowner in Hawaii does not move every 7 years.  many resident owners live in their homes for more than 7 years; renters may move on the average of 7 years.  again  you analogy about beachfront owners are totally ludicrous. has anyone died because they have a beachfront property?  fire in a building is more probable than a beachfront owner being drowned by the waves.  you don't know how to argue but you like to argue   you need to learn how to make relevant and logical arguments - making nonsensical arguments show how stupid you are.  making absurd arguments shows your inability to think clearly.,1

5970,There is no known cure for TDS (Trump Derangement Syndrome) and TPTB have no reason to find one. If the public are easily distracted by this and are willing to be herded into one of two very similar political pens with a very small population of swing voters determining which is bigger  then US "democracy" is easy to manage.  As for Trump being "a moron" what does that say about  the Obama legacy  the Bush political dynasty  the Clinton political machine  the Republican Party leadership and the Democratic Party leadership? After all  they all lost to a moron.,1

5974,Trump is a buffoon. He's a cheap huckster who took his father's fortune and piddled it away. He is a sham President whose pronouncements are contradicted and then immediately ignored by those who supposedly answer to him. If he wasn't so disruptive  he would just be a big  fat joke.,1
5975,Spicer tried to convince us that a small crowd was actually a bigger crowd as well.  Don't trust your eyes  trust what I say. In a nutshell that the Drumpf voter base. Everything is rigged is an oldy but a goody as well. Ignore the fact that we've kept the statistics over time  collected and processed the exact same way. Which leads me to "fake news". News agencies that were once "not fake" only became "fake" once they said something Drumpf found to be not of his liking.  It's to the point that only audio daily press briefings are allowed. That's just fine with Drumpf voters.  The fact is the Tpubs crashed the world's economy  and Obama's admin fixed it.,0
5976,What happened to tolerance and "Love Thy Neighbor"?,0
5977,Don't think so... unless public opinion compells them to do that.  The other issue is that Southwest prefers the US national market. That's its business model.  Also doubt if they will do inter-island travel. The volume of travelers is too small.,0

5991,Why do people discourage future aspirations of kids who have similar talents to them? If your kids have musical talent  give them opportunities to learn  to master their instrument of choice including their voices.   I had parents who restricted choices that frankly had longterm consequences for my siblings.   Anne's 3 year old grandchild needs to know that if she wants to sing  that's awesome and may her parents support her along the way. Anne's experiences  positive and negative  are hers alone. That doesn't mean they'll be replicated by others.,0
5992,It's about time. And when will Canada give Canada back to the native peoples that it stole from them  including the land that the Palestinian supporters and their parents and ancestors have and continue to live on? Shame!,0

5994,It's crap. It's all crap. I won't watch a single NFL game that has any of these fools "protesting". First acknowledge one fact- none of them are ACTUALLY protesting. None of them are ACTUALLY at any Black Lives Matter marches or anything similar.   These are over-privileged athletes. They are NOT forking over money to pay for attorneys to support victims of police brutality or anything else. These clowns have no ounce of true concern for any type of cause or movement- so they do the most convenient  FREE  media-garnering way to say they are ACTUALLY doing something meaningful with their lives.  Don't expect them to sacrifice an ounce of their over-privileged lifestyles to really "help" the causes they "protest". Don't expect any of them to forfeit a game because they are marching in D.C. Don't expect them to be willing to sacrifice their careers  paychecks or fame.   PERMANENTLY ban a player from the NFL and every one of these pansies will stand at the next National Anthem. Guaranteed.,1
5995,Trump is a buffoon. He is the face of treason and betrayal  replacing Benedict Arnold in the history books  standing on the fully supportive shoulders of the GOP.  Trump supporters think he will build a wall  kick a bunch of brown people out  and most importantly  Make America “Great” Again. They hope he will get rid of Obamacare  which ironically  will hurt them the most. Under Obamacare  my pre-existing condition is insured. Before it  I struggled to make payments. Under the exchange  I pay just $200/month for health insurance. Also - My car insurance is down to $25/month (from Insurance Panda). My renters insurance is just $10/month. Under Trump  America will become too unaffordable to live in.   Trump is either a buffoon -- not good -- or in service of the Russians -- same. His advisors and Congress need to stop enabling and apologizing for Trump's treasonous behavior. Congress needs to commence impeachment proceedings.,1

5998,It's getting sidelined with crap like this that cost the Democratic Party the presidency.  Ferchrysakes  if someone doesn't want your business  deprive them of that revenue and publish their prejudice on social media.  That  and organize a  boycott.    That and bathroom access.  UGGhhh!!  I'm hetro and I'm uncomfortable in ALL public restrooms.  Just go in a stall and shut the frickin door.  Doesn't need to be a national issue. There's so much more that IS important. Nuf said!,1
5999,Pity poor Maduro   the appointed heir of Hugo Chavez. All he's  doing is invoking Venezuela version of the LEAP manifesto  to the delight of their fawning Canadian leftist supportrs.  Doubtless their greatest doe-eyed fan  Naomi Klein  is aghast that Canada should be aghast at Maduros action.  C'mon  Naomi  get in their and show us how things are done. You know  in that blood thirsty way that your fave thugs are so fond of.,0
6000,Oh CRAP!  That guy is headed over here to Bend.  But this area is not as dumb as he needs us to be.  It will continue to hurt the Bulletin's already softening circulation.   They're barely out of bankruptcy and this self-deluded Reagan-era worshipper is coming to town to lay it on thick.,1

6005,Well that solves that.,0
6006,Perhaps Mr. Wohlforth is realizing the Permanent Fund has additional purposes other than PFD checks.  That said  he leaves many things to disagree with and question.  What does he mean when he states “The vote would appeal both to our self-interest and our better selves”.  Does he mean that those of us that make less money will have a “self interest” in getting as high of a dividend as possible while earned income from those better off is taken from them to pay this source of unearned income?  Is he referring to the taking of earned income from those better off so that it can be given to me to be appealing to their “better selves”?    If it makes the wealthier Alaskans feel better about themselves by redistributing their money to me  they do not need an income tax/PFD scheme to do it. They could just hand me the money  or give me a house that they purchased with their earned income. Personal checks are totally acceptable. Not expecting it to happen any time soon!,0

6039,First  Trump campaigned on the country's issues.  Hillary rested on her reputation and the expectation that it was her turn.  Her biggest problem  imo  was that the country was in a mess  but she could not run against Obama's 8 years since he was so popular with the party.   I couldn't tell you what she stood for except  I assume  8 more years of Obama's policies of high health insurance rates  reduction of the workforce  low wages  open orders  continued outsourcing of jobs overseas  empowerment of our global enemies  and wasted time and money on people with sexual confusion.  See  you are all about identity politics.  Look at how you describe Trump and how you ignore what he campaigned on.  If you keep talking about the person and keep voting by emotion instead of substance  you better get ready for a long line of conservatives in the shrinking Federal government.  When the country and its people prosper  maybe you'll switch parties too.,0

Environmental and political extremism that completely blows things out of proportion and people who rant on and on that the sky is falling and the world will soon come to an end. Panic stricken high drama horseshit from the liberal left. All of you losers out there who voted for hillary and lost have no interest in staying calm and seeing how things work out  you just want to riot and bitch and moan and snivel. Why dont you guys face the facts and get on board and try to support the democratic process that you stand so strongly for? We are a UNITED States of America. All you people are doing is ripping this country apart.,1

6052,Hi Like i said  it is not "one time" 30 years ago  it has been ongoing for 30 years. There is a difference. I am curious about something.  I have seen you comment on a number of other articles. but i have never seen you comment so heavily on a single article before. This one seems to hit a nerve with you.  Do you know Mr. Ellis ?  You seem a little more passionate about this or a little more vested into this article than others.  Just curious.,0
6053,The point is that Canada failed them both  Khadr even more egregiously because he was a child.,0
6054,Your comment  "...it matters less who young people vote for than the fact that we vote at all..." concerns me. People should not vote if they are not an informed voter. We do not vote just because we can. We must know who and what we are voting for and the impact it will have on society. Yes  it is important for young people to vote  but it is that very generation that will see the greatest impact  good or bad  of those votes. With freedom comes responsibility. It is a civic duty to be informed before you take on such a responsibility. Sometimes that means studying factual history and talking to a few older people who have blazed a path you have yet to hike. There is nothing new under the sun. Man's mistakes tend to be repeated. Be careful.,0

6059,Air fryers are great if you use them right. "Fried" foods that are lightly misted with oil first will turn out crisper and more evenly cooked. Fish comes out great if you cook it on high heat for about 10 minutes per inch of thickness. Chicken wings are excellent  better than baked and not as oily as fried  so your hot wings can be a bit healthier. Honestly  there are better ways to cook a steak  but you also avoid all the oil splatter that often comes with frying on the stove.,0
6060,My Grandpa farmed 160 "acres" in southwest Kansas.  Interesting use of that unit of measurement  don't see that used much in the context of cities. I wonder how many people could define an acre without looking it up on their smart phone? FYI an arce is 1/640 of a square mile or 66 x 660 feet  a rather long rectangle  I'm guessing that makes more sense to farmers.  A more common measurement of density  is people per square mile.  Denver is around 4500.  For comparison; New York City (all boroughs) 27 000  San Francisco 17 000  even the spread out Los Angeles is around 8600 per square mile.  Denver has long long way to go to reach that kind of density.,0

6062,In Western Europe  the fruit was often depicted as an apple.,0
6063,Of course not. There is old or wrong information out-there people come across  or what could have applied decades ago is not the same in a different economic environment. For population growth  Canadians still know how to and want to have babies  and to start and grow more families  more Canadians need the right jobs  too many of which are going to newcomers and foreigners. Government policies let companies get away with it. Some readers may know somebody that would have or wants to form or grow a family  but without or with weak employment income postponed plans. The biggest component of GDP growth is Consumption  means people spending  so employment income is required.  The less Canadians have adequate employment income  the less Consumer spending  suppressing GDP growth. Families also spend a lot  so the more jobs go to Canadians and not more newcomers or foreigners  the more Canadian family growth and spending. Our workforce utilization rate has not been good!,0
6064,My first impression of Fairbanks in May of 1990 was "What a dump. I bet I end up living here." I ended up living here. It is decidedly not a dump.  After several years in Denali (where I met my now wife) we settled in Fairbanks for better job prospects. Initially I wasn't sure about the place but as I came to learn the extensive trail system the mountain biker in me went nuts. I also found plenty of things to get involved in because Fairbanks residents have to create their own good times. People here are doers. When you meet someone questions don't revolve around jobs  we ask where have you hiked/biked/hunted/fished/climbed/etc. In other words  how have you taken advantage of this place and what it offers? You can go to a party and find a millionaire swapping trail tales with a plumber and they've known each other for years and you can't tell which is which from the looks of them.  As for suggestions  visit in March. There is no finer place on Earth than Fairbanks  Alaska  in March.,1
6065,I find it interesting that the coverage of this decision approaches the issue as the actions of one man - Donald Trump. Yet Barack Obama's decision to join the Paris Accord was the decision of just one man. Because it is not a treaty with specific goals  or consequences and is really just voluntary  there was no need for the U.S. Congress to debate or approve this decision. As a matter of fact it was specifically designed this way so that the elected representatives in the U.S. Congress would have no input on the decision. Similarly  The Liberals weren't specific about the costs of their climate policy goals during our last election.  This is what is troubling - if the Liberals had said they were going to introduce a carbon tax that would cost in the neighbourhood of $2000 per family by 2022 how many votes might this have cost them? It's what many people find troubling about the arrogance of our political class (of all types).,0

6067,The politically ambitious often use elected school board positions as an entry point to their careers. Toronto (and Ontario  then ultimately Canada at large) voters will likely see a lot of these people and their self-appointed enlightened do-good agendas in the future.  I don't envy you.,0
6068,Both parties have done that. I remember people shouting "you lie!" at Obama. While I in no way condone shouting over Gardner when he's trying to explain why he's doing what he's doing  I find myself being pushed more towards the Democrats  partly by the GOP's awfulness in recent years  but also by the attitudes I read from GOP supporters in online forums like this. Their perpetual anger and willful ignorance make it impossible for me to even consider voting for them  even though I have in the past. What I want are Independent candidates  but I don't suppose I'll ever get that. The money's not there.,0

6083,I disagree with the verdict.  The woman was septic. I do believe they dismissed her because of her drug taking history. She begged for help and they threw her away like trash. I never go to Mat Su if I can help it. All they care about is money.  I've seen Dr. Lee be an asshole before. Completely inappropriate.   For those who are defending him  wait until someone you love dies because of someone's bias and prejudgment.  I've seen it happen more than once. This is a travesty.  You can't fix Stupid  and Palmer is full of it.,1
6084,WELL DONE. Janine! The root of the problem. Men are too stupid to get it. Their firearms are not really arms...(ahem).,1
6085,I made no assertion about Mr. Trump's legitimacy as president. (And who is "you all"? I'm one guy  and you are asking about something I didn't discuss.)  I did  however  assert that Trump's  beef with news organizations is inconsistent  silly and pointless  especially given his -- how can I put this diplomatically? -- casual acquaintance with truth and transparency.,0

6092,For example too : Trump will never try to get a blowjob from an intern because he already  has a hot wife and is much smarter than a hillbilly from Arkansas! So this is actually a significant benefit to national security.,1
6093,I don't disagree with you on racism in Hawaii from Elderts /Deedy to the death of Dinnan and HPD with an off duty fireman.  However if there is clear evidence Bernhardt confronted police by pointing a crossbow at them after the wife called for police assistance  any talk about racism or perceived racism in Hawaii is not relevant for this case.  That would be pretty clear with picture evidence of the crossbow next to Bernhardt at the scene.   If all Hawaii police would wear a body camera the video would have been the best evidence and clear up this situation when judgment is made.  And not the McD's 'video' of the Deedy/Eldert which was not true video but grainy images taken once per second  or whatever.  Invest in true 4K high definition wearable video cameras,0

6097,What a load. Who takes this drivel seriously? No wonder that nut case in the White House and his creepy partner  Pence got elected; the religious nut cases recognized Trump's crazy  and the hypocrisy they have mastered in Pence.,1
6098,Trump doesn't want to be a dictator...he is a dictator.  He has a legislative branch with his own party holding a majority; that does not want to ever reign in this person's megalomania.  He foments the innate fears of middle America - racism  economic and social prejudices  and lays blame at the steps of anyone who speaks out or stands against him.  For those saying that its refreshing that he is saying what's on his mind  that's like saying Hitler was great because he made it clear exactly what his final solution was to the "Jewish Problem".  The sad part?  Someone like Trump from his social background  has little love for the average white male that espouses Trump's platform and racially charged diatribes.,1
6099,Right on! The only reason he came out with these ludicrous statements  and attempted to deflect the hacking argument away from the Russians  was  his  ego. He was scared Sh....Less that his election would be over-turned and we know that Trump never loses. What a loser!!!,1
6100,Obviously it's an anecdote.  The "When I ..." opening puts that out there.  I don't think your second sentence is on topic with my question though.

6105,Actually I have to say -- he did great. He kept to the issues that needed to be pointed out. While Hillary and the Media tried to make it about Trumps past "Comments". Actions speak louder than words. Words don't really matter to most of us and we know that.  Destroying relations with Russian/China as Hillary would do is much worse than saying. Wow she is hot! In much cruder terms.  The point is we have 20Trillion in debt. Failed policies and RINOS in D.C. we all want that change.,0

6130,So what is your plan. What should he state do? Have been up close and personal with homeless people and it is hard to put a finger on what motivates them. One family tells me...I don't want to live in a apartment with all the rules. No can do this  no can do that. Out here we do what we like. So how do you change the attitude?

6132,Hey Maggie.  Kinda low information aren't we?  False intelligence on WMDs originated with the Clinton Administration in 1998. An d I quote Slick Willie Clinton:  ""One way or the other  we are determined to deny Iraq the capacity to develop weapons of mass destruction and the missiles to deliver them. That is our bottom line."      President Clinton  Feb. 4  1998.    "Saddam Hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process."      Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D  CA)  Dec. 16  1998.,0
6133,You insulted me with your *** "Mr. Reyes and Mr. Trump employ identical tactics. Their posts and tweets are juvenile." -**** "Juvenile"  LesterP?

6134,At least try to get his age right.  Pete is 66  not 64.  What other facts in this article are wrong too?,0
6135,No to any type of fix.   The current number of DACAs in the program is 800 000 but could grow to 5 million with more illegal alien adult ("kids" 18 years or older) reaching the age to enter the deferred deportation program. DACAs and pro-immigration groups have made it clear that they want US citizens to demand that amnesty and US citizenship for the 11-20 million illegal aliens in the US. Another additional 20 million would include chain immigration - relatives outside the US that would have US citizenship given to them. Start enforcing the immigration laws and start deporting.,0
6136,Yeah  "those" entitled bastards that just want to live. Where do they get off? When the rubber hits the road  some of "those" deadbeats just have to understand that their lives simply aren't worth the $$ to save them. Clearly "they" haven't lead a productive  god-fearing life. If they had  "they" wouldn't be in this predicament. I say send all of the "takers" away to some socialist state... leave us alone. Sincerely  Anti-Pie-in-the-Sky Guy,1

6141,Even if Mueller is capable of doing his job fairly without recusal  there is always the question of its being accepted as legitimate and untainted by the public  especially if it comes to a conclusion harmful to Trump.   Mueller does seem to inspire unrivaled confidence in his ability to be objective and to follow the law and keep the investigation focused on its proper target--and not to get carried away like Fitzgerald (probably also one of his friends)  losing sight of the original rationale. But it is strange that Republicans are always forced to recuse themselves  like Sessions or Nunes  at the slightest whiff of a conflict  but Lynch and others are not held to the same standard. Why is that?,0
6142,I mean  at least spell the word correctly if you're going to shout it out in all-caps  right? . "you would likely qualify?" --- thanks  you just shot yourself in the foot.  Responsible gun owners don't need someone- especially you via coercion from the government- subjectivity dictating what they "likely qualify" for. . Firearms aren't a "privilege " they're a right.

6149,This had absolutely nothing to do with your claim that "Newfoundland and Alberta are in economic hardship because government has mismanaged resources."  This is all about the collapse of oil prices worldwide - nothing to do with provincial mismanagement  You miss the fact that the pipeline delivers oil to where it can be exported and at a much better price.  The revenues from oil exports not only benefit the producing provinces but all of Canada as the enhanced tax revenues allow for greater sustainable spending on social services.  You have heard of federal support to provinces and territories by way of major transfers (including the Canada Health Transfer  the Canada Social Transfer and Equalization)  eh?    The Conservatives realized that and pursued a from 2007 to 2015 greatly increased transfers to the provinces from $47.1 billion (Per Capita Allocation $1 434) in 2007 to $68 billion (Per Capita Allocation $1 899)  and the Conservatives managed to do this during a major recession.,0
6150,I just don't understand the outrage...  I watched the footage over and over again  and I see a group of armed men trying to flank a unit of armed police through the long grass.  Then one of them fires at the police after which the police return fire.  Anywhere in the world if you attack police in a large group they are going to fire on you.  Stop calling it a massacre  you are diluting the true message of this horror show:  Don't attack the police.  They have guns.,0

6158,The Donald has been in office for quite a while  well past his first hundred days where in past administrations  lots was accomplished.  With the Donald  there was basically zero.  It is just good that Obama did a good job and the country is sound today.  Imagine if this was 8 years ago.    I don't know what you mean that "most of the important Committees of the U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives are still Chaired by Democrats  with the Republicans mostly still being "Freshmen" occupying the less important Committees."   Far as I know both the senate and the house are controlled by republicans.    Anyway  I am looking forward to my tax cut but I won't hold my breath waiting.  lol,0
6159,WRONG! I have been paying into Medicare since 1969. Next year I will be on Medicare.  It's not my fault you're still working at age 68. You should have planned better  and saved more  but I guess your priorities were on other things.,0

Do you never give a friend a gift? What a lonely miserable life you must lead if you don't.   Can you imagine if the "markets" had dictated the price of roads?

We do not let in those who are intolerant and give them Canadian rights. Your kids will have zero tolerance until your kids grow up and start living in the real world  start paying exhorbitant taxes  exhorbitant prices for homes  food  water  bills  etc. Doesn't mean they'll be racist. Just means they'll learn about debts and how we cannot afford to help every poor soul. It is a numbers game and if you haven't noticed our number is at a trillion and Liberals have been projected at an added 1.5 trillion of debt.  Wake your dumb a$$ up.

6200,Biden’s such a p u s s y. I miss Trump. He would have answered.,1
6201,Never hire a Muslim  a Black person or a female...ever!,1
6202,You people are on a fast track to ruin! Drugs kill.,0
6203,Here Here! Enough Resist Impeach,0
6204,"How Canada can support immigration in the era of Brexit and Trump" This 'immigration' term is all purposely misleading by the media and certain opinion-shapers. As the word immigration states  you assume  it comes from different areas of the world  but what Canadians are getting  mainly   is people from one particular part of the planet not vent on assimilation   rather their wish is to impose their political-religious ideology  on this country's  naive citizens  aided of course by a sympathetic PM agenda to eventually allow their barbaric practices in Canada. Beware.,0
6205,Pocho  it's amazing how "educated" you can make yourself "sound". The easy part to figure out is that you ARE educated beyond your intelligence !! How would you describe the mass killings in Las Vegas  Colorado  and the East Coast ??? Hhhmmmmm  let me think here: It wasn't Muslims   it wasn't Asians  it wasn't Africans  definitely not immigrants  not even MORON Presidents .......... Oh yeah  they were ALL WHITE AMERICANS !!!!! They weren't Liberals or Conservatives  they were mass murderers  weren't they ???? None of them changed laws  I doubt any of them knew who George Soros was  or Larry da Hustler  for that matter. Looks to me like Judge Watson is JUST DOING HIS JOB WITHOUT BIAS !! You  on the other hand  seem to be hung up on labels that a truly educated human would not need to rely on.,1
6206,She's mentally ill.  Period.,1
6207,If she had any decency  she would resign. Not because of her opinion or her views  but because "f*** you all" response is not befitting of a leader. But perhaps I'm living in a dream world.,0
6208,This should be a good test of morals for the people of Juneau. Will they protect and stand in the corner of this corrupt politician who defended people who were into  child molestation  and child porn or will they toss her out of the airlock for her hypocrisy and stupidity? People of Alaska are not that dumb. We all know that she retracted her letters and made an apology only because of the firestorm it created. If no one spoke up  she would still be holding hand in hand with these child molesters. So what sort of voters do we have in Juneau  eh? We will know soon enough!!,1
6209,Perhaps you may be able to suggest a way to deliver a plane with no engine? Planes and the engines are built in certified plants  you can't just farm out production of the jet engines because you are behind schedule. As for streetcars  if metrolinks would allow  they could easily bring some in from plants in Europe  but they are stuck on built in Ontario.,0
6210,Religious zealots they are.,0
6211,You people are pathetic.  Grasping at straws as your cognitive disabled golden boy descends further into madness.,1
6212,True.  But they can can change their gender  sexual orientation and their name on Oregon driver licenses.,0
6213,Cal  this is one of your more ignorant and boring columns.  And that's saying a lot.,1
6214,Taggart leaving may actually be a plus for Oregon.  The powers that be at Oregon  should be contacting Scott Frost at Central Florida.  Oregon made a mistake in firing Helfrich last year.  Timing is everything and patience is a virtue when it comes to long term strategy.,0
6215,And they ALL strongly support Trump...,0
6216,all peace lovers and moderates want a Two state solution  this was the original idea of the United Nations Partition in 1948   ONE STATE - a radical extreme position that was the position of the Arab countries in 1948 and still is the position of the extremists today AFTER losing the 5 wars they started   The United Nations  Europe  USA and Russia all want a TWO STATE solution - but not Arab countries   There are many extremist Arabs who want ONE state  but hypocritically say they want TWO states   that is  reason not to trust the Palestinians and their Arab and leftist supporters in the West,0
6217,How does one finance such an undertaking? I am assuming she wont be employed or sponsored for the two years and for the time she is already spent? Just curious.,0
6218,What a load of hyperbolic crap. You wouldn't know free speech if it hit you in the face.  As to all your other whines:  The simple fact is that your hero  Trump is not liked - or even tolerated - by the majority of the American people precisely because he represents a sell-out of all that is truly American.  Not only is he an illegimate President  he's a traitor  a tyrant and a reprehensible con man.  If you think real Americans are going to shut up and tolerate the destruction of American values and laws  you're as crazy as Trump.,1
6219,Trump is a despicable human being  incompetent in his job  a disgrace to America and what it stands for and needs to be removed.,1
6220,Even more proof (not that we needed it) that Clarke's "liberals' are right wing conservatives who are hiding behind the liberal name and are cast off's of the former socreds.  And they love ex King Harper as they took a lot of the Harper's old staff and incorporated them into their current party.  The right love names that hide their true intent like the "freedom caucus" in the USA's congress.  Their action actually are not freedoms but more of a taliban like hardline rightwing approach.  Please BC's think long and hard who u vote for in the next election and don't be fooled by FAKE news put out the Clarke and her right wing cohorts.,0
6221,"First off  they do NOT have loads of room for expansion. They will be adding terminal F and that will be the END of them."  Not true. They continue to add branches off the other existing terminals. And I consider an entire new terminal to be "loads" of room. Compared to most any other hub in the country they have way more room. The limitation after Terminal F is not the design of the terminals  it is that they had less acreage than DIA to begin with.   I lived there for 15 years and never had any of the problems you describe. Especially now with Pre  you are literally 10 minutes between car and plane  whether coming or going. Having the gates just on the other side of security significantly reduces the time compared to DEN. On a GOOD day at DEN you are 30 minutes from your car upon arrival  often longer. Disconnected concourses serve no benefit to the traveler  it's a horrible design flaw.  Yes there can be long taxis at DFW  as there can be at DEN as well.,0
6222,They are lower than slum lords-they are CRIMINALS. Does anybody remember they LOST a class action lawsuit and were ordered by the court to pay BACK more than $500 0000 in fees  and extortion level service charges for things like a lockout? I think this was around 2003 or so  and even then  $400 for a new set of keys.....,1
6223,BS. Racist. Either the tags are good are not. Another reason to Whitesplain racial profiling. He clearly realized he f'd up. Lousy Officers are everywhere. They hire Officers like this with racial bias off the street all the Time. Report them. Its 2017! Ps. He didn't even run her License...clearly he knew he f'd up. White People are not comfortable with admitting Racial profiling like this. lol,0
6224,A huge problem in DC is that the overwhelming majority of the staff's are Dems  as I found out when I attended the inauguration in January. I learned that Murkowski's office is almost all Dem and voted FOR Hillary  while a US Army captain in the Army Corps of Engineers told me he wouldn't dare speak well of Trump  as that office was totally for Hillary.  So I can easily believe the WH has staff of the same ilk and the sooner Kelly can rid the WH of Hillary supporters the better.  I suspect Preibus did a very poor job of vetting  and if Kelly cleans the place up  then all the more proof Preibus was the wrong guy.,0
6225,Which asylum is that  the one you escaped from?,0
6226,China had opium pushed on it against its will.  Canada goes looking for cheap highs all on its own.  Don't blame China. Blame yourselves.,0
6227,The cost of this stupid lawsuit needs to come out of Johnson's pocket.  He's really on a roll this session  but not in a good way.,1
6228,Then keep your vagina off the Internet.,1
6229,Savages need reservations.  Anybody who thinks that hurting people is the way forward is just a savage.  Let them keep to themselves.  Savages need access to helpful information  not to propaganda.  It might sooth the savages if they could learn Hebrew so they can read signs and be productive in society if they want to be.  The Jews should provide them blankets in non-partisan colors they prefer  water  and food if they can't grow enough for themselves.,0

6231,Hello beautifuls!!!!! Capy is painfully kissable,0
6232,Actually no.  It is in the best interest of Ontario and all its residents to have infrastructure development contracts awarded to the company that provides the best quality and price.  If the local firms DO have the technical skills and know how than they already will provide the best quality and price because they have a natural advantage by knowing the local market.  Therefore the ONLY reason why you have to mandate local firms get awarded contracts is because they DO NOT have the technical skills or know how OR they are overcharging.  The problem here is two-fold.  First you get lower quality goods and services or overpay for the same quality.  Second  by propping up companies that wouldn't otherwise be able to compete you raise the costs for better performing companies that COULD compete.  You support the underperformers and make it harder for the top performers to succeed.,0
6233,Climate change has always existed  and always will. Humans cannot stop it from happening no matter how they distribute their currency.  Let's talk about keeping the air and water clean instead.,0
6234,Former? You mean Chrétien and Martin Government?,0
6235,yes  and as opposed to the cartel we have up here and marketing boards in Wisconsin they had their Grow Wisconsin Dairy initiative which has killed 2400 farms in the last three years and is driving up production all the while tilting to a monopoly. That's what we have up here - a dairy monopoly/cartel. Maybe you didn't read the article past the first paragraph where it was said not to blame Canada.  There's too much dairy everywhere and that includes Canada and the US. Having monopolies and cartels run the show is not the answer.,0
6236,Only a sociopath would take delight in the suffering of others. Perhaps you should get professional help or at least acquire an iota of compassion.,1
6237,Sounds like I'll be left behind by this "plan." I get that Trump and the Republicans don't care about my access to healthcare  but the RG just had a story about Greg Walden's OWN district. Lots of his own constituents will lose their coverage too.,0
6238,Especially hard on the people who can't go 20 minutes without a cigarette.,0
6239,How to defeat racism? Write an article about how bad white people are!   Oh yes  you are building bridges.,1
6240,We know that the framing of polls makes a major difference to the outcome. It is unfortunate that IPSOS and the Globe chose to use the word "illegal". This is factually wrong. Legal experts will tell you that refugee claimants have a legal right to seek asylum according to the 1951 Geneva Convention signed by Canada. The Geneva Convention has been incorporated into Canada's Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. It is not illegal for asylum seekers to enter Canada by foot. As one government official recently told me  it would however be illegal for the government to deport them without a hearing (before the Immigration and Refugee Board) to determine whether or not they require protection from persecution in their county of origin.  Canada has a long humanitarian tradition of protecting refugees & this has served us well. Today refugees and Immigrants are a major reason why Canada is one of the most tolerant  peaceful and prosperous countries on earth.,0
6241,"The officer drove to the area after seeing multiple cars with loud exhausts  lowered suspensions and spoilers ......"  There sure are a lot of overly loud vehicles in Kent these days.  Maybe our police department should issue tickets to the drivers of these loud vehicles once in a while?  There must surly be a noise ordinance in Kent  right?,0
6242,Good advice. Will you abide by it too?,0
6243,Eye make-up will never protect you. From any thing.,0
6244,they like to hit it a long way,0
6245,Their going to study the housing market?????  are you  kidding me!!!! We need action know  not in 2 years when houses will be over 2 mill. Yes the middle class  what a joke  what a complete  joke!!!!!!!! TORONTO NEEDS ACTION KNOW  HOW ARE WE TO OWN A HOME?????? HOW MUCH DEBT MUST WE CARRY TO LIVE????? 2019 WILL COME  OUR VOICES WILL HEARD  I CAN ASSURE YOU OF THAT.,0
6246,Another commenter with zero credibility.  You can't fix stupid.,1
6247,Not to take anything away from their collective suffering but his statement "The stupidity and evil of the Haqqani network's kidnapping of a pilgrim"  might have included a reference to his own stupidity for taking his very vulnerable wife and unborn child over there in the first place.,1
6248,Is this that same racist looser up there that tried to block off a public road with boulders because he didn't like the fact that a bus full of white kids were using a road on "his" land?  Troops shut that down real quick.,1
6249,"Will President Trump step up to lead US against bigotry?"  As this day began  this question struck me as naive; as the day ends  it's obviously preposterous.  Donald Trump is a despicable  filthy racist.  We have always known this about him.  Many people voted against him because he is a despicable  filthy racist; some voted for him  having convinced themselves that it was ok to vote for him despite the fact that he is a despicable  filthy racist; some people clearly voted for him precisely because he's a despicable  filthy racist; but no one did not know that Donald Trump is despicable  filthy racist. Today  at his impromptu "news conference"  Trump fully embraced the alt-right  the white supremacists  the neo-Nazis  the fascists  the Klansmen who make up his base.  This filthy  despicable man said that the Nazis were being treated unfairly by the press! No one can support Trump  no one can work for him  without being stained by the filth of the man. It's time to impeach.,1
6250,What the hell does this have to do with the above article. Or Alaska in general... If you want to bitch about trump and Russia go do it on an article that relates. No one cares about your opinion here,1
6251,This article is patently dishonest.  Not one mention about how Seaton voted to give away our oil when he voted for SB-21.  Or how Seaton voted against the amendments that were offered on the House floor to mitigate the damage SB-21 is causing.  Seaton thinks we should further damage the Alaska economy by raids on the Permanent Fund and by taking more money from working families.  We can not expect those who have consistently been wrong to now offer credible solutions.  Seaton grew state spending unsustainably year after year.  He then voted to give away our oil  AND pay billions in corporate welfare to Big Oil.  His "solution" is just a gimmick- hurt Alaskans to subsidize the theft of $10 billion dollars of our oil per year.  Dr. Robin Brena- who did NOT create this mess- has shown us how to fix it without further hurting Alaskans and our economy.  Interesting that Seaton ignores this.  http://www.akleg.gov/basis/get_documents.asp?session=30&docid=829,0
6252,That is an interesting take on getting someone disqualified. They had better really look at that rule word for word.,0
6253,It's hard for me to suppress a giggle when I see someone "vaping."  The image that comes to mind is a toddler with a pacifier in its mouth.  In both cases there's no nutrition being delivered.  It's merely someone who needs to feel comforted by having a fake nipple in his mouth to suck on.,1
6254,If you have never seen the Spencer Tracy noir film "Bad Day at Black Rock" I highly recommend it.  While fictional  it captures the "fear and hate" and turns a mirror on it.  Well worth finding.,0
6255,Hey  fifty-cent  you're on a Canadian website  not an American one. Be more careful or your paymaster will dock you a dime for mixing up your insults.  Most of us are already aware that an extradition treaty  such as the one China desires with Canada  is negotiated between sovereign nations. And as such  there are a great many people in this sovereign nation  including myself  who believe that China's barbaric judicial and penal systems are not things we wish to assist.  Does it ever bother you that the only defence China can ever make for its human rights policies is distraction  obfuscation and umbrage?,0
6256,I wrote the following proposed amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 2011. My commentary regarding it can be read online at: bit.ly/v48deL   Proposed Amendment XXVIII Re: Article I Section 8. [3] All multinational corporations or enterprises  international corporations  transnational corporations  and micro-multinational corporations with management headquarters located in a home country outside of the United States shall be recognized as foreign Nations  and shall be required to contract an Agreement with the United States Congress before selling their goods and services in the United States or its territories.   COMMENTARY QUOTE:  "For clarity regarding my proposed Amendment XXVIII (28)  consider the direct parallel it has to the illegal alien issue that plagues U.S. immigration policy  especially in light of the fact that the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that corporations are people in the eyes of the law. ... we have become gutless to act in our own long-term self-interest.",0
6257,If anyone is interested. WalMart on W11th no longer charges for bags. Wonder why,0
6258,That is a bit of a stretch Outsider! People in other countries have always been able to express their thoughts on the US and its role in the world.,0
6259,Dumb analogy. Most beaches are watched by lifeguards. "Idiots" entering in conditions way over their heads are warned or rescued. The idiots who enter closed trails and get in way over their heads - most often with the idea to get some "rad photos for the gram" are the ones who put innocent lives in danger. The ocean has preventative options. Hiking on expert only or closed trails do not.,1
6260,Isn't it odd  if this is true  that you can't provide proof?,0
6261,You  sir  are an idiot.,1
6262,And some have whacko militias.,1
6263,Wait a minute  I got it.,0
6264,There is a "military training department".,0
6265,Not sure if "people are dumb" is the best descriptor  but you are correct that we tend to seek out and grasp at anything that supports our beliefs and hopes. Hence the proliferation of "fake news"  which feeds those wants.,1
6266,What a stupid comment!  You worried about him not keeping promises?  In a timely fashion?  Do you think he has a magic wand?  Give him time.........,1
6267,OMG  best response to this dude  EVER.,0
6268,"At the end of the day there is VERY little a politician can do to help the economy. For the most part the best thing they can do is get out of the way."  I'll be happy if he just stops actively hurting the Canadian economy.,0
6269,Another idiot who should never own a gun.....if you can't keep a loaded firearm from a toddler  the Second Amendment isn't for you.,1
6270,Horrible shirt for a horrible coach and cheater!! And to Ms. Emily Jashinsky  (the editor)  I don't think it's that Liberals are anti-military  there not!! It's that they're anti-racist  anti-Islamophobic  and anti-xenophobic!!,1
6271,The CBC director and board of governors are uber Conservatives appointed and then reappointed for years into the future by Harper. Of course the Globe and Post are firmly in the Conservative fold and the Sun is more or less The Rebel.  The Conservatives could hardly ask for a more sympathetic press in fact they were supine during the Harper years  and cheerleaders now. We can only dream of having a courageous press who seek to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable instead our media has done the opposite for years.,0
6272,Lets hope not.      You would think that if such poor service was provided that a contract had to be taken away from a company  that that company would be barred (at least for a certain time period) from bidding on the same types of contracts in the future.,0
6273,So the moderates  who can clearly reconcile those passages with living in a modern  pluralistic  secular world  are the ones who worry you  frank? That's a bit paranoid don't you think? Especially since there is no evidence to connect moderates with the fanatics.,0
6274,It wasn't "senseless."  The bison slaughter was intended to reduce Plains Indians to a state of dependency and subjugation  to steal their lands  and to feed lower-wage workers imported from China to build the transcontinental railroad  during the same civil war era. So like Scammon's 19th Century slaughter of the gray whales in their Baha California calving grounds (where I've swum with them)  it allowed corporate America (which are "people  you know " according to Mitt Romney) to exploit a species to near extinction in just a few years  for short term profit.,0

6278,Yes! Harry Kim is for the people.,0
6279,to to actually support it you know it would be just like saying that you know what a- what are you crazy i mean there,1
6280,If the system is flagging you for unfair votes then I'd say the system is working. You're little more than a troll  bartender. Your comments are mostly rubbish.,1
6281,Hey waha nui  this Hawaii ruling is your karmic payback for eight years of your pathetic birtherist lies.  I agree with the legal grounds for the ruling  but your karmic comeuppance is more telling and significant.  Next time you like call us liars  mo betta you think twice unless you're ready for more of the same.  False crack  Medevac -- no mess with us  brah.,1
6282,If there is any reason for consternation  it is the sanctimonious attitude of Senator Lindsey Graham. During his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination  Graham was funded largely by the defense industry. The weapons manufacturers regarded him more favourably than his competitors because he was the most hawkish of the candidates and the one most likely to engage in international sabre rattling if elected President. Senator Graham has always been afraid that peace might break out between the United States and Russia. His Russophobic paranoia is pathetic. His demand for an inquiry into ties between members of Trump's team and Russia is rooted far more in his visceral dislike of Trump than in any real concern for national security. The Republican Party dodged a bullet by rejecting Lindsey Graham  one of the most dangerous warmongers in the U.S. Senate.,0

6286,Every child deserves an education whether they are disabled or not especially if its something that's inherited at birth why are we so discriminatory to children that are bullied and shamed every day?

6287,Why does such a talented player have to  be a jerk?,1
6288,Great concept.  As the article points out the need is there on both sides  the problem is connecting the dots.,0
6289,Excellent post Lazeelink. Jeopardy is what I would describe as a drive-by. He sees a post  doesn't agree with it or rather is terrified of the concept of duty to country so in his little peanut brain he remembers a Hollywood movie he once saw  even though it is not comparable  and uses it as a haphazard example. He wouldn't add anything once he is called out because  as mentioned  he is a drive by.   Some of the more cognitively challenged posters do this when they see a comment on the Avrow Arrow  they reverts back to a part-truth made for TV movie and use it as fact.,0

6293,The current drive to abolish or opt out of standardized testing certainly won't help. No disrespect to the competent UO students  there are many  and the faculty (it certainly is not their fault)  but the stark absence of basic grammar and writing skills among the typical UO freshman is egregious  and these are the students who actually made it out of Oregon public schools into college.,0

6295,Dumb is dumber when one is clueless....or hungry.,1
6296,Trudeau should fight for Canada. Trudeau has no business getting involved in U.S. politics. That will only harm our relationship and thus our economic interests.   Doug should remember that Canada is busy chasing a free trade agreement with China  an authoritarian state that persecutes religious minorities  hampers the free flow of information (not just label them "fake news")  kidnaps people it does not like  uses forced confessions in courts  etc.,0
6297,The EU is a bunch of appointed elitists that imagine that their rules and regulations  are a priority and ignore  the sovereignty of any country within the EU.  The upcoming trade agreement between Britain and the US is seen as a threat to the EU as other countries want access to the US market so they may negotiate outside the EU.  Many in the EU are far left and actually would like to see one world government.,0

6307,It will be interesting to see how the right deals with (or doesn't) with O'Lielly. We've already seen that the LEFT is consistent in their values when it comes to Weinstein - they've condemned and cut ties to him  etc.   How much time do you think the right will spend on O'Lielly's predation? Even 1/10th the time they spent on Weinstein? Or will they  once again  be flaming hypocrites on this?,1

I did  he was restricted  his name-abductions were changed to "change the name "and suspended for a time...Not in that order.  He apparently did not like it....

6316,Then you should look at a map showing all of red and blue America not by counties  which don't vote  but by people  who do. America was more blue than red in presidential voting  just not in the right states. Some of the largest counties by land area voted Republican and are red but the number of actual people in them pales in comparison to the largest counties by population that voted Democratic but are smaller in square miles. So your looking at a map of red and blue counties is entirely misleading as to the actual preference of the voters. The vast majority of living  breathing human beings  not land  voted against the buffoon currently in the White House.,1

6319,The abject SWINDLE that SB21 brought us remains & none of our Legislators seriously works to restore equitably. Then there are the un-addressed personal swindles of Legislators - per diem  travel excesses  patronage  LIO debacles  etc. It just gets worse & worse. Far too many people now seem to accept seizure of the PFD because they're too lazy to do more than occasionally  courteously  complain. The obviously oiled Legislators (think first of the 2 Senators) should be publicly vilified at every opportunity.,0
6320,So Trump is a snowflake?    He has lived his life with a very real entitlement of wealth since his birth.    He just didn't have to claim it  it was given to him as a child.    I will say he's done more with his entitlement than most. He loves his entitlement and uses to his advantage  (which I think is what he want the country to do)  What is the alt-right in your opinion?

6324,Pandora17  For me -- I have never flagged or considered any comment as 'uncivil'. I have my say AND I let others have their say -- no matter what they say. Fighting back is very unproductive AND a waste of alwats limited bandwidth.  So as far as I'm concerned you may always have your say and I may or may not read it. I almost never get into a bomb dropping fight with anyone. I do try to point out to those others on this site that they might just consider that their way does NOT promote good site citizenship or site sharing.  Probably you know that aggressive or snarky behavior is revealing and a 'tell; on that persons state of mind.  Aggressive directed at others all too often causes others to respond 'in kind'.  So if you make your point gently  carefully and respectfully others are far more likely to give it a fair hearing in their own minds. IF you attack or use aggressive language you are just asking to be rejected  because that is what human self defense behavior does!!,0

6328,I've been in plantation gyms built of wood about 80 years ago. They're probably fire traps like Kim says.   What happens if there is a fire and everyone tries to leave at the same time. One entrance is open the other is not. The fire is near the open entrance caused by smoking near the door..   People dump their costumes and instruments into large garbage bags and try to carry out with them. As a result there is a pileup at both doors. People die. Wont we blame the mayor for that when the fastival organisers have a running joke about doing fire watches?,0
6329,The amount of trash left overnight really was ridiculous.  I suspect the appeal will be at least partially successful considering some idiot wrote the contract to give them until 5pm the next day to clean up. No doubt someone thought it would be 90% cleaned up & gave another day for the finishing touches.  Only amateurs don't bother to have a crew emptying waste containers continuously during the event.  But it appears that's what they are.   I don't get why  if public marijuana use is prohibited  an event whose primary and traditional purpose is to have a large group of people use marijuana in public is given a permit as if no one will light up. Does someone at the City not actually know what a 4/20 event entails?  It's like permitting a beer festival and and trusting that no one will consume alcohol.  The complaint that no one actually got sick or injured? Is that a requirement for banning an event/organizer  or is there discretion that the city doesn't like how it went?,1

Hence the element of chance.  God is the greatest gambler of all  so to speak. Giving free will to humans (and  possibly  even to animals...up to point) lends a certain randomness to creation.  What a dull LOTL you would be were you pre-programmed by God. Me  too.   Chance brings the frisson of unpredictability to life. And thank God for it!,0

6334,“We feel that the number of people positively contributing to downtown greatly outnumbers the small population of transients ” he said. I think I could agree with statement in general.  However  the reality is that even though I might encounter 20 "normal/safe" people in a block  the one or two transients that I encounter in that same block either panhandling or appearing to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol is what determines my feeling of safety or personal security.  I thought it would be a good "adventure" a couple of months ago at about 11 AM on a weekday to take my grandson (age 4) to downtown and walk around.  It was an adventure to be sure.

6350,Of course it is a failure.  The RCMP identified the perpetrators in the majority of cases years ago.  We know  where the majority of these people went between victimization of prostitutes and murder by significant others .  We also know that murdered and missing indigenous men is probably even a greater disaster.  And we know that trying to maintain a subsidized semi-nomadic anti-capitalist male controlled culture inside a modern first world capitalist society leads to corruption  waste  hubris and desperation.  The Globe and Mail is partly responsible for creating unrealistic expectations in indigenous groups by raising the expectation that some mislabeled public investigation would have had in the first place.,0

Requiring government employees dealing with the public to refrain from advertising a religion when on duty hardly seems onerous  let alone absurd.  In fact  it sounds quite enlightened.  This editorial could easily have been written by Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III.  Religious "liberty" should not trump (sic) other generally applicable laws nor common sense.  (Nonetheless  once a masked person has identified him- or herself for a bus ride or borrowing a library book  it should not be necessary to stay unmasked thereafter.),0

6381,I'm not sure I subscribe to the legal theory that this was not a crime of passion. It seems he never was taught  nor worked out for himself  how to have a civilized deep relationship  and now he never will. One can't help but wonder how this might have ended differently if we didn't put firearms in the hands of social angst-ridden adolescents. Why allow firearms to author such great harm during these moments of immature emotional indiscretion? That seems  in hindsight  like something that should have been foreseen by sober adults in positions of public responsibility.  I guess it "works out " though. Not only did someone make a firearm's worth of profit selling the murder weapon  but now someone else has the income associated with providing services for one human lifespan worth of incarceration. Pretty good investment return when viewed from the eyes of a sociopathic capitalist.,0

6383,I disagree.  Even the most cautious people must go out at night - to pick up visitors at the airport; run to the store for a forgotten item  enjoy a cultural event  visit friends  etc.  Accepting some additional risk at night is one thing but accepting inevitable assaults as the penalty for being out at night?  No; we should not cede our city over to night crawlers so easily.  Fight back.  Cities bigger than Anchorage are safer at night than we are.  This is our problem to address.  Let's not give up.,0

6394,I agree with your thought.  I am not sure how effective the policy would be at removing any advantage - I would trade what's  his name for Crosby any day - but it would be more of a deterrent.  Don Cherry's view is that the Instigator Rule prevents teams from protecting their Stars.  That is worth noting because the writer cites Cherry as agreeing there is a problem  but he fails to note Cherry's unsatisfactory (in my view) solution.   Better to penalize stick work severely   as  you say.  If that never happens  Cherry's thoughts may be better than doing nothing however.,0

6398,Trump signed it for two reasons: 1. First and foremost  if he didn't sign it  it would make him look like an even worse Russia sycophant than he clearly already is to Mueller. 2.

Rather than look like the idiot he is  he prefers to sign it  pretend he's doing it for the people  then indulge in his favorite past time: Whining endlessly about how he's been screwed.,1

6403,I think there is little danger of the country becoming a one party nation. Mick's letter is evidence that the light bulb is starting to come on with center/right democrats (which aren't really all that different than left/center republicans). But I question how successful a bus load of Oregon democrats showing up in Cheyenne  WY and arguing their case would be?  It seems what historically happens (without some major catastrophe; secession  depression  or major war) is that eventually a party goes too far and loses faith with the center and is rejected. Unfortunately for the nation  it looks like we may have reached the tipping point with representative democracy where folks and their elected representatives have no checks on their desires and both parties are now elected by who can promise the most and spend the most (Trump times may be different). Our next major catastrophe could be the implosion of our debt. If it happens suddenly  that's when a dictator will appear.,0

6415,They brought in an expert to determine if the whale was a gray whale or a humpback. Those are baleen whales and look absolutely nothing like a toothed whale  such as a beluga. Gray whales are gray  have long faces  and are almost 50 feet long! Belugas are white  have stubby noses  teeth  and only get to 18 feet long (adult males). There is absolutely no way to mistake a gray whale for a beluga IF a person bothered to identify what they were shooting at - a primary tenet of hunting. So  either these people are lying when they say they "thought it was a beluga" or they didn't bother even identifying the animal before they started shooting.,0

Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte joked Friday that soldiers could rape up to three women  as he reassured them of his full support under his newly imposed regional martial law.  Given that Duterte responded to the rape of his own daughter by calling her a “drama queen ” such horrible inhuman statements are hardly unusual.    And this is why Trump loves the guy.

6428,Another stupid ruling by another stupid liberal judge.  The only reason that the country wears seat belts is because the Federal Government threatened to cut Transportation Funding to states that did not pass laws requiring all drivers and passengers wear them.  The Federal Government uses the power of the purse to control every State's education  healthcare and social programs.   This judge will either be overturned or the States will finally free themselves from Federal requirements tied to Federal funding.    This is just another obstructionist attempt to thwart enforcement of our National sovereignty.  The left will use the courts to obstruct every policy that does not promote open borders.

6452,The reason the other mayors are on board is because they have been cut in on the action as they are slated to receive some of the tax revenue. It is laughable that Mayor Caldwell is quoted in saying " I remain hopeful that common sense is going to prevail".  This from a man who obviously lacks common sense regarding this disaster of a rail project which is going to not only bankrupt the City but eventually the entire state.   It would be very funny were it not so tragic.   There should not be a special session called by Ige if this whole tax scheme collapses as time runs out for this legislative session. There needs to be a pause and we need to see what the Feds and Trump decide and a new proposal for rail needs to be put on the table.  Stop it at the Stadium for now. There has been very few if any rail projects like this that were built all at once.  Most projects of this kind are built in segments and changes are made as problems in operation/maintenance etc are discovered.,0

Perhaps I have an arsenal  including numerous  Title II automatic firearms - referred to by the ATF as "NFA" firearms and  which require a $200 tax each to the Feds to possess.   You know  short barreled shotguns  machine guns  silencers  short barreled rifles  Destructive devices (including large bore firearms - .50 caliber and up)  street sweepers and 'other firearms' as defined by ATF.  If I have enough money  I could have multiple numbers in each category if approved by ATF.  You will never know.  The person who 'invades my castle' will be the first to know.  Do I have one  none  or that arsenal above?  The Lady or the Tiger?  You pays your money and you takes your chances.,0

6469,Mr. smith:  To my knowledge  no one is suggesting your wife should not have every civil right and have all the access the ADA provides.  This editorial is about the "misuse" of Service Dogs by those who a) do not have the legitimate need for them b) have dogs which have NOT been trained and certified as legitimate service Dogs or c) both a and b.  You are very protective of your wife's civil rights. I honor you for that...I would be too.  However  may I reiterate  to my knowledge  the editorial and every comment on this thread is supportive of your wife and her ability to use her service dog and enter any public space (including all businesses) completely unfettered.    I  for one  have absolutely NO argument with you about that. Question: Do you feel any efforts should be made to address the issue of persons "misusing" the provisions of the law regarding Service Dogs?  Should  persons"lying" about their disability and/or their Service Dogs be addressed? If so?How  If not  Why? GCrum,0

6476,Ask NFL commissioner Roger Goodell  although I'm quite sure he doesn't know either   It's because of the Ideal gas Law  PV=nRT  where: P   is the pressure of the gas  V   is the volume of the gas  n   is the amount of substance of gas (in moles)  R   is the ideal  or universal  gas constant  equal to the product of the Boltzmann constant and the Avogadro constant  T  is the absolute temperature of the gas.  To put it simply  when the gas is warm the molecules are in greater movement and exert more pressure on the wall they are being contained in (in this case a tire  but the same applies for a football or a basketball etc)   A drop in temp causes the molecules to be less active and they exert less pressure on the walls of the tire  hence the drop in psi.,0
6477,At the adjunct profit rate  a football coach with no assistants should bring in at least ~6 times his salary in revenue. Not even Alabama gets close to that. The entire AD at CU  with hundreds employees making lots of money  doesn't even bring in 6 times the coach's salary. So yes  if you want to make money  hire more teachers. But at the very least  realize that you are stating your priorities when the pay is this unbalanced.,0

6485,The long pass just hasn't been in the game plan for Lynch. All I ever see is dinking and dunking for both the QB's and I'm not thrilled with that style. What I am trying to get at is Lynch doesn't seem to have the same talents and vision as Siemian and the Broncos are sure looking to be wasting time trying to accomplish that. Heck  if Elway is happy waiting for Lynch that's all that matters I guess. Lynch would have been a great draft choice if Tebow was still the starter. Would have had 2 guys wanting to run a lot and throw bombs LOL. They could take weeks off here there subbing each other and trying to stay healthy.   Sloter is an example of a guy that looks like he can learn what Siemian is learning. Sad predicament for Elway to have your camp arm looking better than a top draft pick even if it is preseason.,0
6486,I am very informed about Eglinton LRT. I have attended public consultation meetings and expressed my concerns. The stations will be far apart like a subway. The people along the route who had easy access to transit will now have to walk a much greater distance to get to a transit stop. Once they get there they will find that the LRT train is grossly overcrowded because of massive condominium overbuilding at each station and the low capacity of the LRT compared to a subway. The advantages of a subway are high capacity and speed. The advantages of a streetcar system are short distances between stops and easy passenger access. Eglinton LRT has low capacity and difficult passenger access. It has all of the disadvantages of a subway and a streetcar with none of the advantages. The net result will be that more people will drive than is the case now.,0
6487,Oh yeah  you mean the same "poor kids" we see standing at the bus stops in shorts and t-shirts when it is 10 below zero?

6489,Wait for it:   Trump will step down and let his children run his business.       A future Trump Tweet:   "It will be the greatest blind trust in history  totally blind  ...trust me  a fabulous blind trust...    Worth BILLIONS....     Just fantastic...  #Ivankawillbegreat",0
6490,Trump is certainly not "presidential" in his behavior. But then again  neither was John F. Kennedy  who was known for screwing around behind Jackie O's back with other women besides Marilyn. And that's the very reason why I trust Trump more than Obummer or Killery...they're both plastic smile  say-what-you-wanna-hear politicians. That's what being "presidential" is. I wouldn't trust Trump if he was presidential.  I  personally  never liked him. Never watched his TV show because I thought he was being an ass every time he said "You're fired" like a bratty little child. I voted for him not because I "like" him (because I don't). I voted for him because of his vision of taking back the government away from corporate interests. I voted for him because  despite suffering failure  he bounced back and become successful again...and that's the ability we need in the White House. I voted for him because of the very fact that he ISN'T a politician. But I sure as hell don't idolize the guy.,1

Then the eventual  but quick reveals (on almost a daily basis) that he's also unable to do the "deals" he promised  not only a racist but a White Supremacist (the worst kind of racist)  ripping off the Federal Government allowing his subordinates to do so  an idiot who doesn't understand what he's talking about  an international provocateur who appears to WANT nuclear war  etc.  etc.  etc.  THEN  this.  One of the guys who was supposed to give us confidence that the bundle of severe deficiencies and disorders occupying the seat of President would be balanced by someone of cooler temperament  intelligence and unquestionable character.  The horror.  Kelly is either a liar or incompetent.    Now  I'm really scared.    And  I wonder what the military has done in the past that Kelly has either lied about or covered up. . . .,1
6494,Funny   I was thinking the same thing!! I'm also sick and tired of irrational a-holes thinking its a cops "job" to get shot and assaulted. I'm curious if you know  as you seem to be an expert on the matter  how many people police contact on a daily basis and what percentage of them get killed or assaulted for NO reason!   Seems like from the article there was a dispute where someone had a gun and was possibly shooting it at someone else. Are YOU  Mr Sanuy the 2nd  willing to give the local police your phone number so they call you to go handle the situation???? Wanna ball up in a fetal position till it's over and then talk about the injustices?  Deputy Olson  you have the community in largers support  minus a few. Just because your and your fellow police officers have a difficult and obviously dangerous job  does not mean you have to be a victim.,0

6512,By saturation I mean in terms of farmland. HT varieties account for roughly 90% of soybeans and 80% of maize  and those numbers have plateaued. The only other crop that is at all likely to have a HT variety developed is wheat  but that's primarily a winter crop  grown when the monarchs are in Mexico.  As for as monoculture is concerned  that's a side effect of farming practices that were standard well before the arrival of GMOs. I agree that monoculture is a potential issue  but the ability to target specific attributes means GMOs provide a mechanism to preemptively increase crop diversity  or even add resistance when a blight appears.,0

6514,When it comes to LGTB people and our rights as citizens  Trump is playing both sides against the middle. But the media  including this outlet  continue to parrot the false meme that Donald Trump is some kind of new Republican hero when it comes to gay issues. He's not. As Michelangelo Signorile has noted  Trump's entire cabinet is a veritable Who's Who of homophobes with proven track records of being virulently anti-gay. Somehow  the media never cover that. It bears asking: why not? As for Neil Gorsuch and how he might shape the Supreme Court on LGTB issues  that remains shrouded in mystery which only time will tell. Anyone who's seriously interested in understanding the game Trump is playing on LGTB issues should read Signorile's takedown of the lazy media and the manner in which they're all playing along with Trump and his web of lies and deceit:  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/be-certain-of-this-donald-trump-will-try-to-eviscerate-lgbtq-equality_us_589357c5e4b0af07cb6bddd3,0

6540,In our desire for vengeance  against Bell Pottinger and now KPMG  we tend to forget that there are many  many innocent employees who will suffer as a result of the calls to topple the companies concerned. Employees who were never involved in the dealings with the Guptas and young Zuma  who never knew about the SARS report  but who carried out their tasks according to their ethics and consciences  and who provide/provided their specific clients with the best levels of service they possibly can/could. Many executives of both organisations have been "named and shamed" and forced to resign or have been or will be fired. These are the people who should be charged and sued in their personal capacities and should be expelled from the relevant industry bodies and prevented from carrying out business in the same field again.

6544,I've heard about age-ism directly from headhunters.  They would call me up  excited about background  and ask if I was interested in such-and-such an opportunity.  I would say yes  then not here back from them.  When I followed up  they've give evasive weasel-words about "other candidates whose backgrounds more closely suited the employer's requirements".    On a couple of occasions  I subsequently asked why they were so excited about my background and made out like it was an ideal fit.  More weasel words.  When I finally asked  directly  whether it was because of my age  they both admitted it was so.   There are assumptions made by employers about impending retirement plans; about increased sick leave due to age-related illness; and about limited skills with technology.  The headhunters laughed about the first fallacy  given how Millennials are more likely to move onto other jobs than Boomers late in their careers.,0

6561,brad12>  What  you got "chicken" and deleted your "threatening" posts to beat me up????  You're just a "waahaa" and a fool.  Do you think you can write all that nasty stuff and insulting me will make you look good in the eyes of the other posters  huh????  I have never touched MJ in my lifetime  that is a true statement.  But unlike you  who is to lazy to grow your own MJ  must steal from others to fuel your awful habit.  Wise up you fool!!!!  It's never too late to rehab yourself.  As I have told you before  when you resort to name calling  you are what you call someone else  right????  Nuff said!!!!,1
6562,OFF TOPIC:  Mighty thinned skin immature morons blocking civil posts. Think I will hire a hacker to investigate. When ADN called for renewal I said NO. I can watch idiots talk on TV any day and call it news  without exerpts from braindead groupies  and watch the trump world crashing down on us all in living color and popcorn. May as well enjoy the American future decline with stupid uneducated fools pushing the wagon over cliff. But I dont have to pay for colloquial backwater political under educated braindead on-line newspaper posters who are REDS scared of any truth that might upset their smoke and mirror idea of reality. Party on dudes!!,1
6563,Fixing the first sentence for the Post:  "An arrest warrant was issued Tuesday out of Arapahoe County for John Bowlen  blood of the city of Denver.",0
6564,How sad that we have a dunce for a president. He always has a look like he messed his underoos or wants to. Keep the idiot home from the summit and send the White House custodian. At least we would have an adult representing our country and not an immature 71 year old just occupying a seat.,1
6565,Here in Canada a very large percentage of students enrolled in the professions are from other countries. Huge numbers of Canadians applied for these positions. What is that all about??  I work in a class of health car professionals. Maybe 10% are Canadian. I think there is a whole other story here that needs to come out. But in todays progressive world...........we will never get the facts. I weep for the people and their families that built Canada.,0

6572,So why was coral mentioned if long lining is the issue here?  If they don't "normally" target it  they don't catch it?   SOME captains and crew are American but majority are not.  It's a tough job/life.  There's clearly not enough that want to work these boats.   We can go back and forth.  What is your solution to feed the masses when more American waters get shut down?  You stated you don't want 2-4 week old fish  where can you get that from a foreign country?  A country with healthy food regulations and strict quotas? Another country out there that has American labor?    It's simple  you shut or clamp down on US fisheries  businesses need to be run and the demand is only going up.  They are forced to bring in inferior product with little regulations and traceability.  That part has nothing to do with fisheries management  that's just basic economics.,0

6582,Most of these women fawned over previous Presidents who were notorious mysogynists. Bill Clinton was on the prowl for women even before he came to Washington. And John F. Kennedy was the worst of the worst  a notorious womanizer  treated women like trash to be discarded after using them for his sick habit. But women of the liberal persuasion would never march or protest against these mysogynistic presidents because they were Democrats and god forbid a Democratic President should engage in anti-feminist and mysogynistic activities like treating women as sex objects to feed their nefarious habit.,1

6605,Gee  where are all the Trumpnuts today?  Well  they'll be here soon  right after they get their talking points handed to them by the Orange Fuhrer.   I've said it before and I'll say it again  the media should seek their news about the White House from reputable sources only  which excludes Trump  Conway  Spicer and everyone in his administration.  The media should cut Trump off at the knees.   Give Trump enough rope and he hangs himself.,1
6606,Now  I'm firmly in the middle class and a long-time Liberal supporter but a) I'm fed up with hearing everything being about the middle class  it always the poorer people who need the most help even if it is ndeed the middle class that drives the economy (if there were any jobs); b) I'm almost certain that the purpose of fundraisers is not to advance the cause of the middle class.,0

6621,Why does anybody want to defend Trump anyway.  The guy is a pig.  He brags about walking into womans dressing rooms at beauty pageants just because he can.  He brags about "grabbing woman by the pussy".  (This should be left in quotes because it shows exactly the character of the person"  Republicans had better options Kasich was a probably best presidential candidate.  Hillary would have been a disaster and she has plenty of skeletons in her closet.  She should have never run.  Her time was over when she lost to Obama.  However  Trump is still a terrible  bigoted  lying president.  His Trump University was just a huge scam.,1
6622,Duke Charles Martel wrote "How about the feds cut equalization in half and use the other half to pay for new military equipment?"  Or  how about this? That we examine all the things that most immediately threaten Canada ... death of the oceans (which constitute the greatest part of the territory adjacent to us)  illicit opioids  or climate change (especially in the Arctic). Each of these have brought more misery or death in the past year than terrorism or military or economic violation of our sovereignty.  It is a mistake to equate increasing defence and equipping the military. They are not the same thing. There is something about the nature of military spending that persuades us to increase it with purchases that really do nothing to make us safer or more secure.,0

6640,======================== " . . solar panels and wind turbines  which now can produce emissions-free electricity cheaper than burning coal." ====================== Above statement from the article ignores scaleability  reliability etc. Unfortunate that the MSM continues to disseminate misleading information on this. Back in Canada Wynne and Notley in two of Canada's key provinces continue to do incalculable damage to the cause of climateering. This change in U.S. policy is further bad news for the faithful. In any case Canadian climateers can take comfort in the fact that if Canada was wiped of the map it would barely move the needle on CO2 emissions.,0

6650,Far too true.  Toronto spends it self into the ground and then complains that is underfunded.  So typical!  Clearly Tory has given up being a conservatives and is now a full fledge Liberal.  If Toronto would spend a few minutes looking at all the grants it gives to community groups  all the funding trying to be a world-class city (if you have to promote it  you aren't) all the funding for special interest groups it doles out  it might be able to afford TCHC and transit.,0

I mean  I kinda get it  being socially shunned sucks  but not being able to inform your community about dangerous individuals sucks even worse. It would be one thing if the allegations were false  but if they're true ... well ... if you don't like the consequences maybe you shouldn't have done the deeds? I mean  I made the front page of my city's newspaper for being "different " on the heals of Columbine and on Mother's Day no less  and that was awkward as hell. It never even crossed my mind to accuse the newspaper of any misconduct. I was weird  apparently that was news  and they shared it. Well  fuck me then.  How is Canada these days?,1

6666,I think the "trick" is to get along with your neighbors on a regular basis instead of as a special event (and regardless of religion or race or national origin).   And that is  as a matter of simple fact  the common practice in Kent.   Now  if only people who voted for different presidential candidates could get along as civilly as our various ethnic groups do  we would really be making progress toward social harmony.,0
6667,“They don’t start by saying the thing is broken  or at least they didn’t until today.” Really? How about: “…That we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood.  Our nation is at war against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred.  Our economy is badly weakened  a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some…Homes have been lost  jobs shed  businesses shuttered.  Our health care is too costly  our schools fail too many -- and each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet.These are the indicators of crisis  subject to data and statistics.  Less measurable  but no less profound  is a sapping of confidence across our land; a nagging fear that America's decline is inevitable  that the next generation must lower its sights...”(Obama’s Inaugural Address  2009). Obama didn’t turn to the politicians assembled behind him and say  “Well  we all know you did your best  folks”.,0
6668,That is my experience as well.   I've been in construction for over 25 years and most govt. people I encounter have a very sanctimonious attitude toward the public and an over inflated opinion of themselves and what they do.

6670,I thought your three reasons were for what Trump brings to the table: Sex  lies and videotape.,1
6671,I laugh when the ignorant tell me: "America is a Christian nation." Not just because Hebrews 11:13-16 KJV plainly states all Christians confess plainly they have no nationality  but also because the 1st amendment legalized devil worship. I have the right to worship your Satan.  PC liberals are the 21st century version of the 16th century Puritan. They want to burn witches. Anyone who disagrees with them is a witch.,1
6672,Trump is more interested in getting rave reviews for his failed effort in Puerto Rico than he is about helping American citizens.  Trump is a piece of garbage who soils the presidency every day he remains in office.    More golf  anyone?,1

6674,Is anybody surprised? This city and the state are all a bunch of incompetent so-called leaders and/or officials. Basically all Useless ! I have absolutely zero confidence that the city or state can do anything right. Get them all off the streets find some land and let them camp there !,1
6675,Megan  mayor want to get $8+ million? For that land? Your story here is why he wants to buy land there  From whom  And at what ratio to fair market value? Plz research the archives property that D. Young attempted to have returned to state ownership fr the federal government. This Archives prop is fenced and abandoned w/parking spaces and paving but no Building. This property  purchased some time ago through Ted Stevens efforts for approx $3.2 million. I ask if this property the "National Archives" land was returned to the state  why is Ethan Berkowitz admin trying to purchase land maybe 1/2 mile away for what seems an inflated price  while land is already on the books. BTW don't let legal business names or LLC's scare you from digging deeper into the true ownership of these lands  if you can find the interested parties or partners who is to benefit  I believe this has the potential to be revealing. Who is to gain from archives prop not being a bus depot  who when the bus depot is clos,0
6676,Bravo!  My group of buddies at the ol' watering hole now has an inviolate rule. When we are together all devices must never be used AND all ringtones must be muted. Any violation requires the purchase of another round of beer by the offender.,0
6677,The ACA doesn't work because it was intentionally sabotaged by not limiting / overhauling the cost & financial incentive structure that has been driving healthcare costs for the last two decades and not using a single payer service.  It is just one more hijacked program that was intended to help the public but instead became a grotesque boondoggle that the right can wave in the air and claim failure.    That is all we can ever expect out of our government. Each side destroys the other's good idea so they can point and blame rather than work together to make something that could actually benefit their constituencies.,0
6678,Let's see...No political experience and runs for the President of the U.S.  Beats one of the most qualified bunch of candidates the GOP ever put out.  Did it on a shoe string budget with the GOP establishment and biased media fighting him all the way.  Then he beats the well oiled and well funded Clinton machine.  He did this all with his head not screwed on right?  Losers will never understand the extent of his achievement and that's why they're losers.    I want to be a big fat racist  bigoted  sociopath  psychopath  narcissist  white supremacist  head unscrewed person like Trump!,1
6679,If you you apply for welfare food stamps etc. you basically declare yourself a ward of the state. As a ward of the state you should give up your rite to vote. Remove yourself from welfare...reinstate voting rites. Welfare is money taken from people who work. Welfare people vote for more welfare. Working people support people having financial hardships but don't want our country voted into a socialist or communist country where we all suffer the tragedy of the commons.,0
6680,Sorry...she made the connection herself...read the article. it's not our fault to take her argument and test it for internal coherence  which I did  and it failed.,0
6681,Wasting our money again. They should have done a survey to see if the citizens agree with it. Now if they remove them it will cost us more money. And to top it off it's just an experiment. How about experimenting with fixing our City's infrastructure mainly roads. Idiots.,1

6685,Still just visiting.,0
6686,Trump is very slow to realise that he has taken on more than he can handle. Fighting a wing of his own party will just make his problems worse and trying to blame it for his failures won't fool anybody. He has to work WITH Congress not against it.,0

6689,I don't have to know a person personally to know about them.

6690,please do not equate an honest prostitute to these whores.,1
6691,Examples  please.,0
6692,Bravo!  Your editorial is right on the mark.   Not only with the Oxycontin debacle but with the thalidomide tragedy of decades past  Health Canada has stood meekly by as thousands of lives were ruined by Big Pharma's criminally deceptive marketing campaigns and its push for profits over safety.   It is time to hold these companies to account through tough legal sanctions that bite hard  otherwise history is bound to  repeat itself (again). Health Canada's mandate is to assure Canadians have access to safe and effective health products; instead  it appears the Ministry is nothing more than a mouthpiece for the international drug cartel.  A settlement of a paltry 2 million dollars is an insult to all Canadians.,0
6693,Nothing like adding $100B and mortgaging my kids future. Why rack up the debt in good times. Between Ontario and Feds 1990's is going rear its ugly head some day,0

6697,"Several cases have cropped up in recent weeks  including a half-dozen people who were rejected after border agents questioned their views on Mr. Trump."  If they have a religious test to enter  its only 'rational' they would have one for personal political views vis-a-vis their president right?  There is a very quick and easy solution  stop going across the border unless its life or death.  In fact  there should be a global boycott by tourists.  When those jobs start disappearing and profits start dropping off  maybe then they'll get the message that they don't exist in a vacuum and as big they are  they are not an island.  I understand the need to reject people they think are problematic  Canada does it to U.S. citizens but this is beyond the pale; the lip smacking self satisfaction of border guards exercising power to be rude and disrespectful to their neighbors will not serve them well in the long-run.  We have no power/voice other than our economic one-let is speak loudly.,0

6700,My family was involved in the West Virginia Union coal mine wars.   They still have the weapons saved after the US army and its airplanes won that war.  My father was a member of the Hoisting and Portable Engineers for his entire life.    I have graduated from the U of O Law School Labor law course.  I also studied it as a undergraduate in Political Science courses.   I am well-versed in the 'real' unions and their accomplishments and the self-serving unions of SEIU 503 and AFSCME.   I was required as a condition of State of Oregon employment to be a member of SEIU 503 for over 12 years.  I saw their emphasis up front and personal.  They most closely resemble a Mafia crime family.      Extortion through strike threats  insider dealing with 'management' and protection of their weaker workers and those arrested and even found guilty of crimes is their current hallmark.     Your condescension is noted and ignored   I stand by my previous opinions.  (What does Trump have to do with it?),0
6701,Remember when right wing racists were afraid to come out and speak their minds in public?

6707,Good thing he waived the gun. That's a lot better than waving a gun.,0
6708,Elway is positioning Lynch to the starter and is giving him every opportunity to succeed. I've posted many times that like all GMs that draft a first round QB  Elway's reputation as a GM is tied to Lynch. Siemian was a nice surprise  but there is a reason he was a 7th round pick and wasn't on most team's draft boards: His lack of athleticism and lack of downfield passing skills. McCoy's offense is the opposite of Kubiak's "run-first  dink and dunk" offense. It requires a strong QB that can hang in the pocket and throw downfield consistently. Siemian checks down way too often (and way too early)  indicating he's not comfortable in the pocket. Lynch has the kind of mobility that if a play breaks down  he can get to the 1st down marker. I'm not expecting Lynch to set the world on fire this season  but I'm hoping he works out enough that going forward Elway can focus on building the rest of the roster.,0

6733,A government shutdown hurts people.  So what?  Why should we care any more than when a private corporation shuts down or undergoes massive layoffs and many people loose their jobs  take their spending power and leave the state (like with the oil companies)?  Why do government workers have the sense of entitlement that their jobs are more important then the private sector's?  Because government employment is definitely not more important than private sector employment.  Government employment and services would not exist if the private sector did not create the economy (like the oil industry in Alaska) or pay taxes.,0
6734,Donald may have just done the world and it's environment a big favour. The  Paris Agreement is hopeless and has no chance of being achieved. Perhaps by the US pulling out  a new  fairer agreement - one that can actually be achieved with reachable targets - can be devised. I bet that 95% of those outraged have not read the Paris Agreement and have no idea what it sets out to do. And it's outrageous that Canadian officials continue to cheerlead for something that they know full well is nothing but a fantasy. Do they really believe that a 30-per-cent reduction in emissions from 2005 levels by 2030 is possible? Canadian politicians should stop lying to the public and start telling the truth.,0

A plant based drug that has been in the pharmacopoeia since the 1500's.  In 2006 the FDA removed it due to lack of recent medical studies.  It was a generic priced at $.09 per pill.

Weekly oil inventory changes of 0.3 mmbpd in a 100 mmbpd marketplace are considered to be 100% relevant. One would think the financial/economic whiz kids would be happy that one or two mmbpd of oil supply could be brought on as a safety valve for political/facility disruptions given that it takes ten to fifteen years to bring online any significant amount of incremental production.

At the risk of being hammered for "politicizing " which no doubt will result from my stating that it's way past time to cease climate change denial  and do what we can to stem the tide of increasingly horrific disasters with a focus on using our technical expertise to switch to alternative energy to reduce the need for fossil fuel ASAP.,0
6761,I think there's probably more to it than what you suggest and suspect April 1212 is right. Having said that  I did have an experience with a border control official at Pearson Intl who demanded a proof of live birth certificate (basically long form birth certificate) because my wife kept her last name and so didn't match our kids' last names. We eventually convinced him she was their birth mother and allowed to travel with them by having our kids (ages 7 and 5 at the time) attest to her being their mommy. So you may be right in the sense that this could very well be the one idiot at the border who needs a refresher. We'll see soon enough whether this becomes widespread or not.  In our case  every time we go to the US  we bring a notarized letter stating that my wife is our kids' mom. Haven't had a problem since (knock wood).,0
6762,Care to explain your accusations?,0
6763,This sort of befuddled mess has somehow become acceptable because we have no accountability in our state government.

6771,If you actually "pay very livable wages" why are you concerned with the min wage hike? Certainly ur employees will still b paid more than the hike yes?   Also "have top of the line health insurance  pay vacation and sick leave" These are not things you should be counting as 'extras' given 2 your employees. These are the MINIMUMS. Workers have organized & fought for those RIGHTS. It is your duty 2 honor them but as a employer your values show when you go above and beyond. Your employees will notice that and you will see  better production  more loyalty  less turn over  increased sales/revenue.   "I do not see how raising minimum wage would help my business or employees" Again  since you are paying "very livable wages" u are correct it wont help  nor will it hurt  your business or employees.   Finally  "am not by any stretch getting rich!"  This is the problem with our current capitalist/neo classical economic system. We prioritize large profits over the HUMANS that make it your $$.,0

6774,Trump claimed that he had to deal with this decision "with heart" & told them to "rest easy" so he throws it to his AG to make the announcement? What a no gut weasel.  Then he tweets if Congress can't do something about it in 6 months he'll revisit it. LIAR!!!! He's not going to do anything.  Racist in Chief is just trying to eliminate anything Obama had passed  period.  What a loser!  He's building a wall and Mexico is going to pay for it. Another lie!!! He wants us tax payers to pay for it & says he'll get Mexico to reimburse us? Huh? By adding a tax that we'll pay when buying goods from Mexico? We're going to pay for it twice?  And he makes his crappy clothes in Mexico? America First huh?  He then claims that unemployment is down to a 16 year low but the DACA program is taking away jobs?  Huh? What an idiot!  If DACA recipients were blonde haired Swedish girls he wouldn't have reversed this.  TRUE FACT!  Lying racist!!!!  Arapio  Charolettesville  now DACA. Racist is as racist does.,1

6784,Carman completely misrepresents what happened.  Harris refused to allow A.G. Sessions to answer her questions.

6786,I'd buy into the 'Vancouver area prices will drop a lot' hypothesis if there was an alternative  i.e. widely available  reasonably priced rentals. Looking at my assessment  I'm sorely tempted to sell and lock in a big gain  but alas  I have two unrepentant smokers in the household.  In earlier times  landlords anxious to rent would look the other way  but nowadays - forget it.  Try and find even a single rental that accepts smokers. Landlords don't need to take the risk with tenants lined up outside to view the place.  The same is true to a lesser degree for prospective tenants with pets  weak employment histories ( i.e  self employed) or maybe on welfare at the low end. Conclusion: home prices will hold or rise over the next few years. A big recession  a serious overbuilding boom or large reduction in immigration are about the only things that will change that situation  and none seem likely.  Interest rates aren't going anywhere until inflation rises first. Rules changes? Not much.,0
6787,Voting. Let's raise the voting age to 21 so the li'l whippersnappers won't have representation. And raise the drinking age to 24.

At one time it was a manned site and people lived there on rotation.  Hut was appx 100ft long and divided into 3 sections  an apt  the main section the radio room  and the far end the diesel generator room.

But since 1980 muslims have killed about 3200 civilians in  America (including 9/11) while non- muslims have killed about 200  including the 168 in Oklahoma.     Now in  order to assess risk  you have to take population into account - muslims are only 1% of the population and non muslims are 99%. Adjusting for this    a muslim is more than 1000 times as likely to cause a terrorist death versus a non muslim.,1
6793,So if you still expect me to take you seriously  LP Anonymous--instead of continuing to assume you are the lightweight fake expert I currently think you are--then the onus is on you this time to take the time and make the effort to try to enlighten me and other readers  and to convince us that you are the real deal  rather than the narrow-minded  short-sighted tech school graduate that I think you are--based on your only demonstrated CB skill so far  i.e. your limited sophomoric ability to take hubristic "hit and run" cheap shots from the cheap seats.    I suggest--if you really want myself and others to take you seriously--then you should "up" your game to something closer to the level of expertise you claim to possess  but which you apparently think all others should simply assume is real  based only on your otherwise stilted  shallow  superficial  and seemingly pedantic--but still  IMO  half-baked--"sound bite" comments.

6823,Considering the State of things in general  I would say these "Experts" are rather idiots and anything but experts. You would not trust them  neither would I and Trump is too smart to trust them not to undermine something along the way. They made their bed and now they get to sleep in it  outside in the cold like a homeless person. You win some and you lose some and sometimes you should keep your mouth shut if you want a job.,1
6824,I'm sitting here trying to understand why this individuals opinion became news?  Take a look at Chicago  California  Florida Texas and several of the states that gone haywire when it comes to living conditions  in relation to pollution.   The author of the article doesn't know Hawaii history and apparently doesn't care about the history of the places he speaks about I find the article willfully ignorant  And quite frankly remedial,1
6825,Aren't you the civic minded soul. What does your crap job pay?,1
6826,As some have posted  probably scud-running under VFR. With the near- total destruction of the aircraft  we'll probably never definitively know exactly what went wrong. But the ADS-B data should show their altitude and track  and we'll know if they filed IFR or not. If they were on an IFR plan  they were way off in altitude  which usually requires at least a 2000' clearance from the highest terrain in the vicinity. If they had an emergency at altitude  they should have had time to at least issue a mayday. But from the photo and reports from the site  it looks as though they flew straight into the mountain at cruise speed.  I had enough experiences with Hageland - many of which a non-pilot would not have been aware - that I really  really tried to avoid them. That said  all the air taxis have their cowboys. I watched one taking off recently  in clear weather  yanking the plane into a 30-degree or greater bank  100' above the ground. Engine failure and a plane full of dead souls. Stupid.,1
6827,After reading this excellent article I do hope that we can move closer to 'We the debating and listening nation' away from 'We the angry nation'.  And away from senseless destruction that makes us poorer culturally and economically.,0
6828,The most obvious Canadian analogy here isn't any of the federal elections (Segal even gets the dates wrong there)  but the Ontario provincial election of 1990.   Like May's Tories  David Peterson's Liberals cynically called an early election while holding a majority government  only to get severely and unexpectedly punished at the polls for it.,0

6835,Bonuses are generally paid to those who achieve success.  If your business cannot survive without continual  massive government handouts  you are not very successful  are you?  Little wonder Canadians are rightly outraged by the arrogance and outright stupidity displayed by Bombardier senior management. And one must wonder if this arrogance and outright stupidity is behind their need for continual handouts in the first place?  Perhaps - just perhaps - what these senior executives need is not a bonus but a pink slip.,1
6836,please dont fall for the liberals propaganda lies idiot,1
6837,The EPA's allowable level of glyphosate residue on carrots is 5ppm  which is equivalent to 5mg/kg. One large carrot is about 80 grams or .08kg  so 5mg/kg(.08kg) = 0.4mg of allowable glyphosate residue on the carrot. If there are 200mg of caffeine in a cup of coffee  that's 500 times as much caffeine in the coffee as glyphosate on the carrot  and if caffeine is 29 times as toxic as glyphosate (rat oral LD50 192 vs 5600) then the acute toxicity of your morning cup of coffee is about 14 500 times as high as the carrot with glyphosate residue.  Significant digits are off in the calculation  I know.  The actions of Californians notwithstanding  a thousand things in your daily environment will kill you off long before Roundup will.,0

6841,$57 612 per year for Oregon is the Average  (That's just salary  not medical  dental  PERS etc.)   (And some make more or it wouldn't be an "average".)  http://www.teacherportal.com/teacher-salaries-by-state/  Let's say $70 000 per year with all those benefits stuck in.  $700 000 divided by $70 000 is 10 (ten) teachers for one year!  An armed robber who also likes to expose himself to little girls.  We all know that there is no such thing as a sex crime in your mind  but most of the rest of us  except for the pedophiles  disagree so this is the cost of keeping a dangerous man away from banks and little girls.,0
6842,Housecats have been with us as domesticated animals for a long time  but "domesticated" implies that humans must care for them. This includes regular visits to the vet and protection from cruelty  environmental mayhem  and the pain of disease. None of that is possible under TNR. A feral cat's life expectancy is a fraction of that of a cat sheltered and cared for in a home. Why?  TNR does nothing more than replace responsible pet stewardship with the law of the jungle. Some people want to be around cats but cannot muster the courage to end a cat's suffering  so they let Mother Nature take care of it--out of sight and out of mind. We don't do this to stray dogs  so why do these people think it's acceptable to do it to cats? TNR is animal cruelty painted over with a self-satisfied smiley face.  MOA Animal Control offers traps that can be used to capture feral cats. Show kindness to such cats by getting them to a shelter where they have a chance of adoption into a caring home.,0
6843,I think I may take up HB 27 as my new cause! I like it very much!,0
6844,Thank you for this article.  In the last 24 hours the word 'home' has come at me in different ways. I saw a person with a sign at a highway on ramp: "Homeless".   So I gave them one of the Subway "credit cards" I try to keep with me. As I was driving along I had a sense that I wanted the driving time to pass by faster  so that I could be HOME. I started praying about this...asking God about why it is sometimes that I want "non-events" to pass by so that I can be somewhere else!  The inspiration that I got during the drive was that if I am truly seeking an ever more perfect union with God to please Him  to serve Him  then I should "feel at home" no matter where I am and no matter what I am doing.  Then in my prayer today..I often used Gabrielle's Bossis's prayer journal (He and I) to start my morning prayer....the word home appeared about 10 times in 2 paragraphs!  And now this nice article.  Thanks.,0
6845,Americans can and do see that the "War on Drugs" has been a trillion dollar failed exercise that's left millions of people in prisons for non-violent  victimless crimes while enriching the private prison industry and cartels  too  Do the facts outweigh public ignorance and hysteria?  Yes  they do!  It's being addressed now at the federal legislative level and soon  the truth will prevail. "Reefer madness" mindset of the masses has caged humans over the use of a plant that can be grown in any backyard  that's been used for 1000's of years  without harm. It's not heroin  again brought home from war. The heroin problem after Vietnam was many times worse than now  and we set up methadone clinics everywhere. We helped them! THAT ended one of the worst horrors brought home from Asia. Now  it's happening again  and THIS time  we know more. You refuse to see facts  but the VA does not  nor do the beancounters and lawmakers in DC  & a better educated public. You rant propaganda. Get facts.,0
6846,That is a stupid comment.,1
6847,This piece is real garbage (disclaimer: I'm not a Trump supporter),1
6848,America  I have a question for you.  When do you decide it's finally time to break up with a guy?,0
6849,You're being very restrained. Trump is a Mega Douche in every way  every day. FEMA is in good shape solely because of Obama  not Trump.  As you pointed out  Trump wants to cut FEMA funding and he's ignored requests for aid from blue states.,0
6850,Hey Eric ...it's been proven that the people inciting violence at the Trump Rally's were sent there and were paid for their services by the Clinton Campaign and so far it looks like everyone knows it except you.

6864,Let's hope the injunction goes ahead and is successful. Our joke of a government should be holding their heads in shame for settling with Khadr but apologizing is insanity,1
6865,Thanks for the reminder . In this day and age we don't talk about tobacco much anymore.  That's one of the worst habits.   While it's use has declined   its not declined  nearly enough.  At every intersection with a stop light   smokers dump their butts out.  That's pathetic. Everyone knows it shortens one's life but they do it anyway.   Our goal should be to reduce and end alcohol   tobacco   and drug use.   It's odd that drug supporters point to how prohibition didn't work   as though that was some sort of a victory for society . When in reality   given the millions of deaths from it---many of whom were innocent victims   the destroyed families and lives    making alcohol legal was perhaps the worst mistake we ever made.   I take a lot of heat for speaking out against drugs   when you'd think people would appreciate I'm looking out for our kids.  Adults put their quest to get high because they can't accept daily life without drugs ahead of whats best for kids and society as a whole.,0

6879,It seems to me that if McConnell's bill is so great  he'd be out promoting it  talking about all its positive features and how it's going to help ordinary Americans.  Presumably  according to some reports  this bill will incorporate approximately 80% of the House bill which was wildly unpopular (17% approval) and which even Trump described as "mean."  The way this bill is being rolled out is unprecedented and highly suspicious.,0
6880,Trudeau was the one who initiated this  and as such he created an expectation of being different. consequently he has the most to lose  when he repeats the same answer over and over again. His performance yesterday was not one of a PM and a would be world statesman  but rather of a poor politician who thought he was being clever by dancing around the question by giving non-answers.  Most voters don't watch QP  but they do watch the clips from it  and every time the clip plays  the damage to his brand gets reinforced.,0

6882,As a Canadian I can only hope that the good old US of A cancels NAFTA. When Mulroney and Reagan set it up  I thought  OH GOOD! I will be able to buy things on one side of the border or the other for the same price.  They will get a minimum wage in all the States!  Health care will become pan-North American.  Instead it has been a simple ploy to allow multinationals to move their businesses to cheap labour locations.  Can you say Caterpillar moving from Canada to Mexico? I knew you could.    And we give American access to our oil  electricity and water.  Please  please cancel this mess.  It will be so good for Canada and Trump lacks the intellectual horsepower to realize it. Nafta has done so much damage to Canada  if Donald gets rid of it I might even vote for him  if I could.,0

6893,People who are so quick to label and condemn this person a "racist" based upon a single  stupid lapse of good judgement should think about the world they are creating and how their own actions may be helping to perpetuate the racial divide and disharmony in this country.    Does the rest of who this person is and what she has done with her life not mean anything? Does it all come down to being judged on one dumb decision on her part? I sense a bit of the self-righteous "Off with their heads!" mob mentality here. I make stupid decisions from time to time. Maybe mine is next. Maybe yours.,1
6894,He's asking Soros and Khan for talking points as I write,0
6895,Marilyn: I believe you are totally right on target when you assert that victims of clergy/sex abuse will suffer all their lives. As someone who was molested by a Catholic priest some fifty five years ago[I am currently sixty seven]  I honestly believe that the effects will be with me until the day I die. That does not mean that I have not made plenty of progress over the years. After I was abused   I  attempted to take my own life. I have lived with the thoughts of suicide most of my adult life. For the most part  those thoughts are no longer with me. But I also know that they could return. There are so many effects of what childhood sexual abuse does to a child and then to the adult that child becomes. The way we coped as children become blockades as we grow into adulthood. I withdrew socially as a child and have never been able to make up for that loss .I drank alcoholically for some 17 years.I am convinced that if I had not stopped drinking  I would be dead by now. Therapy helps.,0
6896,If what you say is true  it's pretty pathetic that the millenials main understanding about the Catholic church is its teachings on sexuality.  And ironic that the only ones talking about the Church's teachings on sexuality are secular homosexuals and feminists in the media  not the Church.  Meanwhile  countless young women are being pressured into being sexual objects by a culture that equates recreational sex with freedom and equality.  And the guys LOVE it:  No more having to take a girl out to dinner a few times to get into her pants!,1

6898,Bababaaals  but no BRAIN.,0
6899,My reason to include off street parking is due to the current lack of on street parking for retail and professional visits downtown.  Eugene allowed development without off street parking for businesses years ago when the population was much smaller than it currently is  I don't think the City planners at the time envisioned the current growth of Eugene.   The mention of the parking garages by an earlier respondent is noted as a reasonable alternative  but due to a frightening experience in the garage at 10th and Oak Street many years ago  I never use the downtown parking garages when I'm by myself.  Also  I know several people who won't use them because of the current population of miscreants that have taken up residency downtown.   Another factor to consider about parking a block or two away from the apartment is the unpredictability of Oregon weather  tenants won't  want to make multiple trips carting items from their car in the rain   they'll park on the street by the building.,0

6909,Aaron  nothing could be further from the truth. APD distributes their (limited) resources based on call volume. As has been the case for years  the swing- and mid-shifts spend most of their time rolling from call to call  which leaves little time for proactive patrols. If you think that they aren't in Mt. View  or Fairview  Spenard  and Downtown  you haven't been paying attention. As others have noted  the best way to protect yourself from crime such as this is to be responsibly armed  as any police department's response time is measured in minutes while robberies such as this are measured in seconds.,0
6910,T-bag endorsed the racists by saying there were good people on both sides in Charlottesville  there are no good Nazis marching with torches people.  Racist people are ignorant and refuse to learn from the mistakes of the past.  That's why the Democratic party has changed  they learned and passed civil rights.  I'm sad the GOP has regressed so far the administration is not part of regular society  the rest of the GOP should do something drastic to change that.  Show they still have a brain.,1

6924,I remember when Burma was one of the most beautiful and intriguing countries in the world.  Syria once held this status as well.  The Myamar military and its' power never went away after the election of the government of Suu Kyi.  A ruthless  without conscience  wealthy  and dangerous separate entity in the country responsible for dealing with foreign threat.  I believe this was the agreement to allow democracy to exist and take shape.   This is what makes it so unfair when leaders and organizations call for her Peace Prize to be returned or to stand up to the military in spite of the overwhelming odds the government would face.  The military thinks it can rule better than the democracy and is waiting for Suu Kyi to slip up.  The military may also think the population supports its' actions.  Now  more than ever  nations have to unite in support of her  and back her up meaningfully.  Check out the video attached and her carefully crafted speech.  A masterful political professional.,0

6934,The place is a cesspool of neglect  poverty  criminality and desperation. Its population is a volatile mix of locals  immigrants (many of whom are illegal)  workers  unemployed and criminals. To top it all  it resides on a steep slope.   I have no idea how the authorities think they can make this place liveable  without spending hundreds of millions on terracing and installing sewerage  water and power. It is also probably one of the most dangerous spots in the city.  Blocking will require some form of census  and many if it's residents don't want that  for obvious reasons.  The only way to get it right is for the community itself to identify the criminal elements that live among them  isolate them  and then participate in the "blocking" as temporary city employees.  The city will have to break its own laws to expedite this process.,1

That might clash with the narrative of the feelings-first "leaders" who are progressively running things into the ground.   Regular working  Eugenians paying their ridiculously high taxes for years haven't had any political representation in the city of Eugene for decades. We need a hero. The real question is  are we smart enough and do we have the guts to vote that hero into a position of authority to to start working on the things that affect us  and not the things that offend us.,0

Second  if it is going to put sector  surely the good govt workers would been pick up by the incoming management  no? Hey  where's the special legislation to HELP ME?! I'm paying for all this btw  more than of the reporters are. Sold my investment property and the frigging state was all right up in my grill for taxes on that.

Now he’s in front of the entire world  where he has people who will actually hold him accountable for the things he says  and he does not know how to process that  because its not in his character to do so. He’s been a liar his entire life! He’s a BS artist! And when he gets backed into a corner  then his default is to lie  make something up  deflect and divert  and when people call him on it  he says “fake news.”,0

6964,Anyone (that's you) who uses inappropriate words like "dumb" when referring to the Smart is actually the dumb one in the group. Play on words is easy for stupid-infused comments  and is no help to the original poster who specifically asked about the Smart car  which he said he likes. Rather than insulting him  just stay away from the keyboard  please. As for the Smart car  the new generation (2016 on) is a great city car. It has overcome all of the drawbacks of the previous year's version  and is now up to the task. It is strictly a two-seater  but those seats are quite generous. You'll be surprised with the headroom  which  is as useful as your minivan's - just go to a Smart dealer and try sitting in one yourself. My wife was blown away by the actual usable space in the tiny Smart at the auto show. Estimates of the storage space for groceries - once you take out the useless parcel shelf in the trunk  there is a plenty for even a month's shopping for a couple..,1

It appears Donald Trump has told multiple lies  yet what gives him special protection?,0

Everyone with half a brain in here knows that last season was comprised of very talented and seasoned athletes. And everyone in here also knows that this year Ganot had to make due with what athletes wanted to play for UH because of the NCAA and the actions of a very stupid coach aka Arnold. Ganot did a great job last year and this year and will continue to grow this program despite what you say. As far as "no excuses next year Ganot"  we're sure he no plans of failing as you hope he does! So keep bashing PS  as I love to remark on your insane comments!!!,1

6989,It is too easy to consider the sequence of events since BC's May election simply in terms of personal partisan political preferences and thereby fail to see how the constitutional conventions that guide our parliamentary system of Government work so well (especially in contrast to the US congressional system) to aid in the resolution of close or ambiguous election outcomes.  Whereas the US system simply preserves any such deadlock or ambiguity (and thereby stalemate) for 2 or even 4 years  our system forces the leaders of the Parties to try through negotiations to find a stable coalition to govern and if they fail a new election follows.  With very rare exceptions  a stable Government with majority support in the House is the outcome with only a few weeks or a couple of months are needed for the Parties or a new election to sort things out democratically.,0

The Pavlov Institute of Physiology of the Russian Academy of Sciences was founded by Pavlov in 1925 and named after him following his death.Pavlov was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1904. He was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1907 and was awarded the Royal Society's Copley Medal in 1914. He became a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1907. Pavlov's dog  the Pavlovian session and Pavlov's typology are named in his honour.,0

7009,Hey Wyatt   I never approached anybody in the muni about the myriad problems associated with squatters taking up unauthorized residence in vacant muni properties  until some moved in next door to me and I believed  therefore  I was in danger. This all took place on Mayor Berkowitz's watch.  In order to get  more complete picture  ask Ethan how many times I asked for his help in remedying the squatter problem on Hunt Circle. And then ask him how many time he responded to my several  inquires  the correct answer will be zero.    If he is not interested in restoring "quiet enjoyment' of our homes on Hunt Circle  I would expect him to be interested in collecting bed tax as the "senior squatter" charges rent for his shorter term tenants at the previously vacant property. Ethan's attitude has been consistently  "not my problem  dude." Same a Chief Tolley.  And drop the insults  please.  Barbara,0
7010,You appear to have missed the point of the apology and payment completely. Perhaps you should look into reports of the attack and firefight- and then understand that the actions of the government had nothing to do with that- but did have the rights of a Canadian child to a fair trial  rather than years of imprisonment .,0

7021,You speak of morals and hypocrisy.  . Fact you admit he is a liar. His record of lies speak for themselves. Fact: for a President he has one of the most foul mouths ever and he cozies up to friends who language is even worse. It is but a query away. Fact: videos  recordings  quotes of him demeaning women are easily found on the internet. Fact he has committed adultery.  Fact  he has been accused of rape  in a legal deposition.  Fact  he was accused of raping a 13 year old girl in association with a pedophile. Fact he has described his own daughter as a "piece of a.."  Fact “You know  it doesn’t really matter what [the media] write as long as you’ve got a young and beautiful piece of ass.” Fact  He currently has lawsuits against him for his actions threatening violence on others.  Fact: His daughter asked him to promise not to date anyone younger than she  she was 17.  . You claim Liberals are deviant!,1

7029,Johnathan  I understand your questioning  as it does seem "a stretch"  that our "leading  legal lights" could be so far off   the mark on this one. Two of the most vocal  figures in MPD's defense were James  Mooney and  Michael Hargreaves.  Mooney is one of the towering figures in the UO Law School  and Hargreaves one of the best known legal figures in Eugene.   Both did their best to minimize  the record of Deady's significant  support of slavery and the Exclusion Act.   Johnathan  maybe you could correct me  but I do not know of a single UO law professor or leading local  lawyer who  publicly expressed support for our students' concerns over Deady's racism at the time these legal icons were supporting him.  Can you help me on this? Thanks  Doug,0

7034,This is a wonderful restoration. In terms of fish and wildlife  this channelized river was more a barrier than a destination. I must say  this is a pretty sweet deal for Wildish  no restoration of the rubble left in the wake of their extraction industry  24 million scot free for worthless land that Wildish no doubt picked up for peanuts  made literal tons of money from despoiling  and left totally unsuitable for residential construction  if that would even be legal.

I agree we need them. But how many snow plow drivers are we talking about. Probably a very small percentage of other DOT personel. As I said I do not believe we need so much State  payroll.

This plan will in no way help affordability in Vancouver  and in fact make homeowners even more wealthy  while making homes even more expensive! Absolutely backwards policy.

Akin to Christy Clarks sub-prime loan scam. Do not proceed with this policy!!!,0
7040,What a bullshit argument. It's expensive regardless of who initiates it.,1
7041,The main point missed by various posters here is the SCS environment is THE most complex naval combat environment ever if a shooting war breaks out.  There are literally over a million ships of various shapes and sizes floating out there at any given time. If a US sub were to misidentify and sink a ship belonging to another country  the conflict widens. In addition  expect to see the Chinese to adopt various naval guerilla tactics at sea hiding among and being disguised among the civilian ships in the area if war breaks out. There will likely be civilian ships nearby any US naval combat group. Do you broadcast your location and give away targeting information?  China second aircraft carrier under construction will be out at the end of this year and likely commission in late 2018. Their third carrier is under construction now and will have a catapult launch system. Launch year approx 2021.  Yup. As one poster said  sink them  home for nice lunch in a few hours.  Har. Har.

7061,“What does ‘consent’ mean when the agreement is said to be made by pressing a computer key?

As Mark Cuban recently stated the NFL players continue to dilute the NFL brand by alienating an enormous swath of casual and potential customers. The MSM operates under the usual alternative reality theory of abject denial. I'm surprised more NFL sponsors haven't spoken out publicly as their brands continue to be negatively impacted by the NFL players.,0

7081,"Each of those countries has run into economic trouble in different ways."  They have indeed.   They have also tried to implement unsustainable increases in minimum wages using the same spurious arguments put forth by Junction City  et al. That ended up being a major contributor to their eventual collapse. In the cases of Turkey and Brazil  it was the cause of major economic crises.  Had this conversation so many times with their Ministries of Finance  Finance Committees  Central Banks  blah blah blah.   Some how it was always going to be "Different this time" - it never was.

7083,Von Eck refers to the NDP as if it's a functioning programme  but it's not. The real 'albatross around the NDP's neck' is that the ANC alliance is so captured by various forces including lack of vision  incompetence  stasis  corruption  etc that they're unable  not only to implement it as a strategic plan  but the requirements for economic growth and development  which are there for all to see.  Her analysis only alludes to this  perhaps for fear of being considered inappropriately outspoken. There's no merit at this stage being timid and speaking in metaphors.,0

7088,In parts of the article the Klein writes as though he doesn't understand the very concept of insurance. For insurance to work effectively you need to have a larger  rather than smaller  pool of enrollees. Why? because a large pool of insured guarantees that you will have a mix of the old and sick along with the young and healthy. That's the only way insurance can work. Otherwise  only those who have an immediate need will enroll and the cost of paying for their medical bills will bankrupt the insurance company. In a healthy market  these people are indirectly subsidized by the young and healthy who pay premiums but have very low actual medical costs. And  don't forget that even the young and healthy can suffer medical catastrophes. Finally  when Klein writes "if there were functional markets where healthier individuals could purchase cheaper insurance" he seems to misunderstand ObamaCare  which allows insurance companies to charge the older 3 times more than they charge the young.,0

7093,Because they did not.  At least for the reasons you believe. You know full well why some Democrats are fleeing the party that has gone from liberal to progressive. They are people who don't like our flag being burned  who don't want special rights for liberal groups  who want less government and lower tax rates.,0
7094,Tolls are an awful and discriminatory way to collect revenue. They punish those who can least afford them the most.

7109,No  es.  Builders would raise prices if they could.  Why wouldn't they.  As long as they can make more money they will both raise prices and increase pay.  Now  additional factors beyond elastic markets may be at play.  For example  builders face a cyclic market.  While there is demand now  there may not be in a year or two.  There may be a reluctance to raise pay when experience tells builders that the demand won't last but the raises will.  Yet another factor is the influence of unions.  Unions don't like competition  they may work to prevent expansion of the work force thinking that existing workers may be more likely to be laid off if the work force is expanded.  Brook's conclusion about immigrant workers does not even consider all the factors at work in construction.,0

And then the Judge is required by law to provide a Mandatory Minimum Sentence with no possibility of reduction or parole.   That single conviction is good for a Mandatory 5 years and 10 months.  And when the victim testifies that she is the one in the picture and what was being done to her and by whom  will you be there to testify under oath that it did not happen?  The youngest recent victim was only about five years old  so if these pedophiles are relying on their victim's youth  they are in trouble.    That's when all those other charges start adding up to increase the number of years in the pen for each of these pedophiles.  And all of those except one is a Mandatory Minimum Sentence.

7138,FYI  this article does NOT defend Donald Trump  who is in defensible on all counts – what it says is basically that a lot of "low information" voters believe (correctly) that they have been lied to in the past  so they support Trump's claims to be their paladin out of sheer ignorance. Why it is that this transparently dishonest television celebrity can continue to garner support in spite of his obvious lies and pandering would be a total mystery  were it not for the fact that so many Americans have been so thoroughly abused they can no longer distinguish reality from pure fiction. Trump directs them to blame "the other" and "those people" (i.e.  folks who don't look like them) for their troubles  when it is actually people like Trump whom they should blame.,0
7139,"I recently received an email from Gardner that stated it was now time to work on a bipartisan plan for health care. So? Where is it  Senator?" . We already have it - the ACA. It includes well over 100 Republican sponsored amendments  and had substantial Republican support  right up to the time it became an issue that it would be a "win" for Obama and therefore would work against the "single term" priority. At that point  it stopped being about the good of the Country and became a matter of "kill it before Obama benefits from it." The GOP ultimately failed to kill it  but did manage to amend in some poison pills.  . It is relevant to note that most of the elements of the final bill that the GOP is attacking now were added by GOP amendments.,0

7142,Agreed  ATF.   When pushed by "Traditionalists" we are easily driven to speak out against Tradition. I am convinced that the key is understanding Tradition as not just changing over time  but precisely as organically evolving over time. When theologians' instincts tell them current magisterial positions are untenable  the best of them dig deeper into that Tradition and explore it's evolution over time to the current magisterial view. That regularly engenders respect for the current position as a positive growth over time  and provide light as to how the issue can be moved forward today.   As for the Spirit  yes of course our free will MOSTLY dominates and we go astray. I also believe that it is beyond sad that very few people ever seek training in prayer methods designed to listen to and discern what the Spirit is saying. Jesuit spirituality is precisely of that sort  and thus Francis is seems so different and apparently so free. I think we taste the Spirit in him  and we like it!,0

7144,In a country like Canada  with a birth rate that does even replace our current population  immigration is essential to our economic future. If those who oppose immigration were correct  then Japan  a country that is unwelcoming to immigrants  should be an economic powerhouse. It isn't  of course. Its economy has stagnated for almost 2 decades and Japan is facing an economic and demographic crisis.  Moreover  the per capita immigration rate to Canada has been relatively constant since the 1950s  and recent years have seen a steady increase in the education and skill level of immigrants to Canada. Even Donald Trump (a man who is about as anti-immigrant as one can imagine) has cited Canada's criteria for evaluating immigrants as worthy of emulation.,0

7153,Koncerned I do focus on the slope workers as the highest income earners in the state. While you fail to realize the commercial fishing industry employment   on board factory processing ship workers and influx of shore processing cannery workers  the contracted workers in the timber industry  along with the summer workers at the hotels and tourist attractions from foreign countries.  All take their wages and leave.     The 4 000 pipeline workers are in some of the highest paid hourly wage occupations in Alaska.  I would bet the gross wages paid to those workers exceeds all the minimum wages job payrolls  in Alaska.   What I do is not relevant to the issue of what tax scheme is going to get a share from all those who benefit and do not pay.  As a resident of Alaska I will be paying either or both taxes.

Look at and better yet  go experience the world's oceans...land and man's actions are tiny  and not that big a deal! That said  stupid actions that harm plants  and animals of an area have to be considered and dealt with with information and intelligence by the local citizens. Gold mining  strap mining  minerals mining  overuse of chemical pesticides  and deforestation especially in central and south America do need focused attention by all mankind. The Paris Accord forgot to include a few of these important conerms!,1

Obama himself said they could have no real impact on our election and that Trump needs to act like a big boy and accept the results. How quickly that changed...,1
7234,You all need to quit talking about shit that is irrelevant. What's relevant is that a beautiful young woman is gone. Say some prayers for her children that got left behind and her mother who is devastated. It doesn't matter what info the police released or didn't release. It's really none of anyone's business until it is determined what exactly happened. The register guard really needs to stop with the publicity shit as well and allow a mother to grieve for her daughter without constantly having that wound reopens. Have some respect .,1

7242,One Hundred and Eighty Nine  Alaskans gave up $1 000 this year for this? I proposed a new currency for Alaska to be called the "Dividend". Each "Dividend" is worth $1 000.  So today we learn that  we spent another 189 "DIvidends" for membership in these councils that seem to do nothing but provide vacations for our legislators. We have reached the point where we can purchase memberships in these fluff organizations or pay 189 Alaskans the calculated amount of their PFD payment for 2016. We can no longer pay for both.,0

7244,Since neither of them is Chairman of the Judiciary Committee  they have not blocked a hearing on Garland.  Senator Chuck Grassley has.  As for obstructing everything else related to a functioning judiciary  the Senate has considered and confirmed 64% of Obama's nominees referred to the Judiciary Committee this Congress.  Last Congress  when the Senate was controlled by Democrats  63% of Obama's judicial nominees were confirmed.  As for a functioning Congress  the Republican-led Senate has passed 243 laws so far  among them laws to combat opioid abuse  repealing NCLB  a highway bill  an FAA bill  veteran suicide prevention  and a lot more substantive stuff.,0
7245,The problem with rail is that it is not and never the only alternative mode for avoiding traffic. Yes   In Chapter 2 of the Environmental Impact Study an alternative to rail considered was an elevated guideway identical to rail except that buses and high occupancy vehicles would be running on it instead of trains.  It was summarily dismissed as "Not Meeting Purpose and Need".  And the EIS falsely considered it more costly than rail. Falsely because the EIS deliberately omitted the fact that with rail billions more were needed after cost of the guideway - trains  steel rail  and the yearly subsidies for rail added to the existing yearly subsidies for buses and handicap vans.     There is no more need today for "at-grade" rail in Honolulu simply because Honolulu traffic congestion is easily handled by replacing traffic lights with a modern system as is done in Meadowlands  New Jersey where 400 000 vehicles passed thru the area each day.,0
7246,Expl;ained?  Here's a possibility....Both the terms 'conservative' and 'liberal' mean different things to different.  At one time they were classic definitions of attitudes toward social and political change:  liberals being open to change; conservatives dedicated to the status quo and reactionaries  seeking a return to a previous condition.  Today those definitions are quaint  archaic and meaningless to today's discussion.    Today the terms are  more than anything  epithets used to demonize others. Along with that comes the "customized" definition to match that demonization.  Were we to forget those labels and all fill out an exhaustive survey of our political  economic and social beliefs I'd predict there would be huge areas of overlap.  More than we recognize.  Perhaps we should all address issues and express opinions without "pigeon-holing" others in an effort to denigrate their argument.....It would be worth the effort to try.  Gary Crum,0
7247,I've heard the same thing said about earlier generations. Gen X  baby boomers  sandwich generation  etc.     I don't buy it and the studies about distractions in open floor plans (higher stress) and about multitasking (humans  no matter their "generation"  are terrible at it  especially men) don't bear it out  either.    I especially do not understand that millennials would be all that special in this regard. If anything  earlier generations - like boomers and the "greatest generation" lived through some of the biggest disruptions in history: radio  television  air travel  car and consumer culture with nuclear families living in the burbs  leading up to the rise of the net and mobile. They saw it all and many adapted quite well to it.    Of course  then there is the problem that "generations" are mostly a construct that has dubious merits....,0

7256,Since McKenna is making policy on the advice of climate scientists both inside the federal government (ECCC  NRCan  DFO) and outside it  and sticking to the mainstream consensus on climate change held by the vast majority of climate scientists and every single international scientific body that has taken a position on the topic  how is that relevant? She's a cabinet minister smart enough to listen to experts.  I suspect that  plus the fact she's been effective in her role  is why McKenna is one of the main targets of climate 'skeptics' and those opposed to a shift to renewable energy.,0

7260,Great editorial in today's Ketchikan Daily News.  http://www.ketchikandailynews.com/free/Opinion-Editorial-for-Friday--April-30    "Despite legislators’ protestations to the contrary  today’s freebies create a chit that someone expects to collect somewhere  somehow  down the road. It’s all return on investment. Most folks don’t appreciate their legislators racking up that kind of debt.  Also  most folks have a sharp eye for hypocrisy.   Meyer and other legislators have talked an awful lot about budget cuts and fiscal pain ahead. A lot of other Alaskans are hurting already from previous cuts and economic contractions now underway. Stories like this strongly suggest that the pain isn’t likely to reach Meyer and some of his legislative colleagues. As long as they’re in positions of power  someone will be willing to pick up their tabs. And not small tabs from the burger joint down the street. Tabs at places where dinner and drinks for one person can climb over $100.",0
7261,Agreed. This ESPN "host" is a disgusting person.,1
7262,What is all this about crossing the blood-brain-barrier? From time to time I see it written and never does it seem like the person knows what they are talking about. What else crosses the blood-brain-barrier? Salt? Corn syrup? Hair spray? What is the point that people are trying to make?,0
7263,... and so she should have!  That comment from Hillary was the height of elitist arrogance.  It demonstrated just how out-of-touch she was with middle America  and it arguably lost her the election  given that she was running against Trump and all of his baggage.    Note to politico's... people who are down and out due to economic circumstance  regardless of whether or not it is their own fault  do not appreciate being labelled as "a basket of deplorables"  but I guess Hillary's got plenty of time to reflect on that now...,0

7273,Sorry - you confuse and conflate two very different issues. One - Boston College provided an educational event to highlight AL; to begin a process to help US bishops communicate AL; and to host both bishops and theologians to dialogue about a current papal document (which hasn't happened in decades).  So  support a document that was developed via two synods and hundreds of dioceses. Two  to count and use numbers to gauge significance or importance is the work of a small mind Three  the dubia folks do not even start with AL - read their posted dubia - never even quotes from AL....they do not dialogue; they judge based upon their own misunderstandings...so  how can one dialogue when dubia are made up based upon a willful disregard and rejection of a papal document.  (how things have changed since this same group hypocritically condemned liberals if they questioned the sloppy works of JPII or Benny? Sorry  these two things are apples to oranges except in your troll universe.,0

7276,Thank you for asking.  ADA stands for Americans with Disabilities Act  which is a federal law.  Bill 45 removed  language regarding expenses for ADA compliance  and it looked like the surcharge was no longer allowed to be used for those expenses.  I was just assured  however  that this was to fix the law when the first rail surcharge extension was approved.  Therefore  it appears no separate city funding will be required for ADA compliance with respect to the building of rail.,0
7277,How much is a persons "fair share"? I hope most of you realize that your "fair share" won't be determined by you. It will be determined by the legislature and the gov. It is already pretty clear our fair share will mean losing half our dividend or more.........and that is every man woman and child who qualifies. Then there is income and sales tax. The 3 repubs many of you are giddy about joining the dems will be working to take money  a lot of money  out of your pocket.  An article in the News Miner yesterday spoke of the Dem majority planning on ADDING money to the budget for programs they want but couldn't get past Repubs previously. Your "fair share" will be increasing each year. Ask yourself why so many legislature members want to take over a billion dollars out of the private economy. Something ain't right!,0
7278,Trump adopted the phrase 'America First' because it was an old racist Nazi buzzword from years ago. It was a dog-whistle siren call to his white supremacist brethren. Then Bannon spewed out some word salad for Trump to further butcher in an attempt to deny it. They came up with the empty 'isolationism' that Trump immediately denied when he met with Merkel. Trump never had any foreign policy  other than looking to skim money wherever he could. He's got no comprehensive intelligent policy on immigration except to push his xenophobic racist ideas. He's a petty con man  not an actual reasoned or sane human being  he's a fraud. He's imbalanced  unfit for office. Now we have a weak and insecure  belligerent child who imagines himself a fascist saviour. He's no more than an egotistical juvenile buffoon. We need to remove him from the office  get him out of office now. And the courts should have heard the case before reinstating any part of Trump's illegal and immoral ban.,1
7279,The fact that you had to write a piece and put it into the paper to say such and obvious statement shows how screwed up our government is. This is a reason why people do not want the Permanent Fund touched we are still funding crap like this.,1

7283,Our clown of a Prime Minister is putting National security at risk to protect a company that does get government subsidies  just like Boeing says.  Bombardier has been on corporate welfare for decades because of their dual class share structure that ensures nobody can remove the incompetent management from power.  They sell planes for discounts  and taxpayers subsidize the rest.  Instead of putting National security at risk  Trudeau should try explaining HOW this could be considered anything BUT subsidizing Bombardier - otherwise Boeing is completely right.,0

When they do test positive on the day of their scheduled surgery the surgery is cancelled and everyone has a nice little break for a while.  Apparently this happens very often.  This major cause of inefficiency is never talked about or brought up because the staff actually enjoys their lengthy breaks.  It's also PC incorrect to suggest that the veterans themselves are a major cause of the problem.,0

7291,So maybe they should have filed this as a gay wedding  no one can refuse service then.  This group is awful  but this is how censorship works and looks like. Just imagine the reverse outrage if this was a transgender conference or a gay wedding.  I think racists are evil  but they should have equal protection and rights under the law. No matter how stupid their views are. They want to meet as a group and discus their ideas. Warped as they are  they have that right.  Everyone involved should be ashamed.,1

7294,California Democratic votes in 2016 were 6.4% of the total national popular vote.  The vote difference in California wouldn't have put Clinton over the top in the popular vote total without the additional 61.5 million votes she received in other states.  California cast 10.3% of the total national popular vote. 31.9% Trump  62.3% Clinton  In 2012  California cast 10.2% of the national popular vote.  About 62% Democratic   California has 10.2% of Electoral College votes.  8 small western states  with less than a third of California’s population  provided Bush with a bigger margin (1 283 076) than California provided Kerry (1 235 659).,0

7297,I've replied to you elsewhere  but I will point out here that McConnell also fails to acknowledge that Biden was asking only to wait until November  not until January  to nominate  and only IF the president failed to nominate a moderate. Biden said that the committee would have taken up the nomination of a moderate without delay. Judge Garland is  by all accounts (including Republicans)  a moderate and a centrist. If McConnell were really trying to observe a so-called "Biden rule" -- he wasn't  of course -- but if he were  the senate would have taken up the Garland nomination on November 9. McConnell will be remembered in history as a man who professed to love the Senate but who  because he loved his party and ideology more  inflicted great harm on the body he professed to love. He will be remembered  rightly  as a hypocrite.,1
7298,Our government  particularly the CIA  gives the appearance of "benign benevolence " but is very heavy-handed  and exacts a huge toll when it doesn't get its way.

7317,(cont.)  Urban Renewal Districts are unfair. They result in less revenue for schools  city and county essential services. The DTURD is almost 50 years old. The oldest URD in the country. Governor Jerry Brown of California terminated 400 URD’s in 2012. CA State legislators finally admitted that this particular “economic development tool” was harming local governments’ ability to provide basic services.  We believe council should terminate the DTURD as they promised - and NOT put it on the ballot. We know from experience that even if we organize a campaign to oppose it;  spend a lot of money and resources fighting it;  and the voters kill it;   the city will turn their backs on the voters and adopt another amendment by council majority. Just like they did last time. (cont.),0

7330,I think part of it is while Alaska did finally expand medicaid Alaska as a Republican state never embraced the federal mandate of the ACA and in fact our representatives and govenor-at the time worked against it. Subsidies were available the first year but after that and the fact that many Alaskans had been convinced the ACA was evil and were against it the subsidies were discontinued(for not following the mandate) Other red states have the same dilemna(OHIO). Even recently Rep. Don Young also voted for the now infamous Republican plan to gut medicaid. I hope Alaska does get it together before its too late. Alaska could have been and should have been a shining star for healthcare a long time ago if only big business and the powers that be hadn't convinced the rest of us it could never be done.,0

Most people who are homeless are adults and can make decisions about where they will go and #2. NHS rest stop is in the Harlow neighborhood.,0
7335,Why go on about marathons?  Only about 3% of all organized race finishers are marathoners.  The half marathon is the fastest growing event in the world. There are now far more more Half Marathon finishers in North America than 10 KM finishers.   There are almost four times as many half marathon finishers as full marathon finishers.  Half marathon is a challenge while still leaving room in life for some sloth  beer and chocolate. Marathons are a lifestyle choice.  Marathon participation is actually pretty small in the big picture  so the author's wish is essentially already moot.  I've run eight marathons (survived might be a better description) and about 150 half marathons.,0

7337,Any person who thinks that money does not buy access is frightfully naive.  I don't want a government that does not consult and any consultation is going to involve people of influence and money. The question is whether that access leads to policy decisions that would otherwise not have been made. I trust our politicians  from both sides of the spectrum  to be squeaky clean in that regard.,0
7338,You are arguing the extreme  which no one is proposing.  But why stop there? How about  gridlock is good. If you want to reduce road wear while increasing revenue  make it so cars back up on roads and come to a complete stop. This way  they don't wear out the road but while idling  they use gas and the owners pay more gas tax to fix the roads! We have it completely backwards! Fewer and more narrow roads  more cars  more congestion and our funding problem is solved.,0

7343,Personally  I doubt there is more to discover about Trump and Russia. My concern is what we already know and how Trump has responded  which is symptomatic of the man.  We know for a fact that Russia tried to disrupt the 2016 presidential election  not only through hacking but also through a massive  sophisticated misinformation campaign. No  I don't think Trump colluded with the Russians or even knew about it then  but he did take full advantage of the chaos caused by their activities.  But now that he does know what happened  Trump still stubbornly refuses to acknowledge it. His ego simply won't allow him to accept that his election may have been tainted by the mischief of a foreign government. That's a major problem.,0

7348,EFC  Thank you for your reply.  I understand that there is room here for people of good will to see the situation differently. However  I do think saying that prosecution is not recommended falls under the finding that no criminal act occurred. If I understand Comey correctly  it seems he and his panel did not find that there was any intent involved and  for them  that is what separates it from a criminal act. Apparently he sees a distinction between "extreme negligence" and "gross negligence" that many others do not.    The issue is that  not just Comey  but the FBI panel that reviewed the issue unanimously agreed that it did not meet the definition you have quoted. So  the question you are asking should go to him and the panel that reviewed the situation (reopening the investigation may be that they are having second thoughts).    I understand the seriousness of this issue. I also understand that how one sees it will  very likely  fall under partisan lines.   Respectfully  John David,0
7349,Nope  it's an example of the Deep State and the Fake News elites using orchestrated leaks of classified information to undermine a legally and lawfully President and to overturn election results because they don't like the person who won the election.  These leaks from the Deep State and their Fake News allies are blatant and viscous attacks on democracy  the rule of law  the voters and President Trump.  President Trump and his administration have every right to do what they need to do to stop these leaks and bring all the guilty parties to justice. Obama set the precedent for going after leakers  so the Dems and the Fake News have no right to complain.,0

7362,And therein lies the problem -- not everyone will feel the pain. The people who work will feel the pain through a new income tax that will impair their ability to choose what to do with their income. It will restrict charitable contributions  savings and the ability to pay for their kids' college. Meantime  those who don't work will still be getting their PFD and government benefits because a great many of those are federally mandated. And  those taxes -- they'll start out at a moderate 6% or so and then eventually grow to 30% or more because all the accountant folks say that what they really need to be if there's no oil revenue.  So  feeling the pain ... only if you're a productive citizen.,0
7363,- The nation lost 31 200 full-time jobs  and gained 34 300 part-time jobs during the month. - All the job gains were self-employed and public sector.  - Canada lost 50 500 jobs in the private sector. - this reflects the departure of 45 500 people from the labor force. About half of those were youth  meaning many young people looking for work have stopped looking.   This pretty much sums up how bad things are in Canada with the Liberals.  As much as this government soaks itself with glitzy and expensive perfume a turd is still a turd.,1
7364,Obama was supported by the naive and ignorant who think US policy should be about being nice; and who better to implement such a policy as the nice  mild-mannered  Black guy?    Nice guys finish last  and I know that winning is hard for losers to aspire to  but it's a good thing for our country to prosper in a world of global competition.  Obama was particularly popular with foreign leaders.  Why?  Because he stopped defending our country's interests.  Kumbaya is a great song  but it ignores the reality of the world.,1
7365,$317 million in State money divided by how many full time Alaska resident students? How much per full time student?

You mean we could save money by sending students to Harvard or Yale or nearly anywhere else?,0
7366,I'm not sure I can find your statement convincing. I think the fact that he is a self proclamed shit lord demonstrates that he cares only about stirring up trouble.

7401,Big Glenn's open letter to President Putin  Vladimir some nice arctic kit you have there buddy! Good for you. No doubt you are going to take our resource rich north and why not? Successive Liberal governments have castrated our defense capability starting with Trudeau senior when he halved the Canadian Forces and did away with 3 entire infantry regiments and the battalions under them  along with other combat arms units and support. I understand that they still tell the stories of Dmitriy Ustinov  who was your defense Minister then actually dancing and howling that day! Yah - one of the 4th largest military's to today almost nothing and a laughing stick. Yes I know the Defense Minister is a piece-of-work too... i can see you laughing at that one.

The Globe projects shameless "progressive" biases that prefer politically correct narratives over critical analysis and common sense. Brexit and Trump  for better or worse  have demonstrated the lengths arrogant self-serving mainstream media will go to push a subjective agenda  with skewed polls and editorials that consistently show a contempt for reality. The Globe needs to lose the smug tone and flush the toilet.,1

7419,The problem isn't that the supervisors are making too little  it's that the represented workers are making too much.  We need better negotiators on the city's side...ones who won't cave in to such outrageous demands for inflated salaries.  Now we're stuck with paying the supervisors more as well because it "only makes sense" they would make more.  There go our property taxes again...out-pacing inflation as usual and driving us into the poor house.,0
7420,Yeah  they didn't think this through  but at the higher levels of decision making "think" is what they are supposed to be doing.  Or what is the point of electing  or appointing people with advanced education  and years of business or political  experience.  When this "ban" first came into effect there were plenty of commenters on this website and others who raised all the possible ways this ban could impact people.  The general public could work out the implications fast enough.  So either no one in Trump's decision making circle  could work it out  or no one cared enough about the collateral damage.  Either is incredible.,0

7448,Albertans are still ranting about Trudeau's NEP! Actually  it was the second NEP. The first one  in the early 1960s  forced Ontarians to buy their oil from Alberta at way above world prices in order to help get their oil industry off the ground. Quebec was allowed to purchase their oil at world prices  which is why gas was a lot cheaper in Quebec than in Ontario. Albertans  though  seem to forget about that first energy policy.,0

I'm saying another factor  oxybenzone  has been identified and we need to make individual choices to its use  and ask for government action if justified.  We can also ask producers and manufacturers to look at this matter for a very quicker response.  I'm assuming they're as heavily invested in healthy people and healthy oceans as we are.,0

7458,Dodge recommends an extreme form of forward guidance  where the path of bank rate changes would be spelled out over some forecast horizon. He obviously hasn’t looked at the Bank of Canada’s own research on the subject.  Experimental work by Oleksiy Krystov and Luba Petersen in 2013 concluded that: “Our communication treatment suggests  that public announcements of the future course of monetary policy may be detrimental to macroeconomic stability.” If the future does not transpire as anticipated  and the central bank must change its forecast path of rate rises  this can serve to confuse market actors and to undermine confidence in the central bank.,0

7463,Wrong. Trying to justify more of the same abuse onto Canadian society and the economy does us no favors. The idea of considering more foreigners for population growth and skills is wrong to begin with  since we have done way too much of it already  we have too many foreigners and newcomers in Canada we should have never have accepted in the first place. That's what is suppressing economic growth and making it harder for Canadian families. Any reasoning to try to get more foreigners into Canada  is manipulative abusive special interests that are not concerned with Canada or Canadian families.

7471,Once again for your viewing pleasure  a list of VECO takers that are still "serving":  Posted: Sunday  October 28  2007  The following 12 legislators all have four things in common: 1) Every one of them has taken more than $10 000 from VECO; 2) When VECO owner Bill Allen asked to be relieved of his requirement to register as a lobbyist  they crafted and passed legislation ending Allen's requirement to register; 3) When presented with hundreds of pages of evidence of VECO's bribery  each of them refused to respond; 4) When asked to admit or deny under oath whether or not they had taken advantage of the illegal polling  services that VECO Vice President Rick Smith admitted having provided to more than 100 o (next post will be the names  I hope)>,0
7472,Here is the latest. Trump reached an agreement with Pelosi and Schumer to enact a law through Congress to put DACA on a permanent status as soon as possible. In exchange  Pelosi and Schumer will support funding for increases in border security  but not the wall. trump wants this done quickly.,0
7473,Just as I am sure many blue collar workers voted for Clinton  I believe Asra is not alone in crossing the norm when voting for Trump.  Rather than vote by party  I applaud anyone who votes their conscience.,0
7474,If ego drives your life  I think it's superb,0
7475,After reading the comments posted here at the end of the article  I agree that the last thing that we need is more student housing  let alone apartments in the downtown or campus are. For the past 20 so years Eugene has been trying to update and revitalize a dying downtown. Trying to encourage people...not businesses to  come downtown.    But let's look at what campus and downtown have to offer us  bars bars tea house bars sushi and a couple boutiques. When I was in my twenties...bars all day every day. But know  why would I want to go to a location that wants to drowned itself in apartments and bars?    Hey Eugene!!! How about bringing some big name shopping stores. Let's give the population and the student body that you are trying to get to live in Eugene more than bars and apartments. Let's start building a customer clientele in those locations instead of trying to force a living space where there is nothing to do.,0
7476,Yes  they do.  That's why  generally speaking  there is so much mixed use development around train stations.,0
7477,Do you sincerely think you know anything about me? What a stupid response/question.,1
7478,Democrats need to have the cajones for once and for all and call out the Republicans for acting or claiming they have the moral high ground on everything when in fact they are morally bankrupt and hypocrites.,1
7479,Thank you from Iowa.,0
7480,And he will continue to look like a complete IDIOT. That's ok  he's digging his own grave!,1
7481,"Lies?" *rolls on floor  laughing directly at your foolishness* You are saying completely nonsensical things. Thou doth protest muchly with speciousness  and so I say to you  friend: "Thanks for confirming to the public with your insecurity the correctness of the  viewpoint I've shared here on this." Had you walked away  there might have been some doubt  but it's clear I've hit a third rail of demagoguery and magical pro-oil anti-Earth thinking. Soak in that.,1
7482,that's something you do when you're young and dumb i guess,1
7483,No let's just ignore some crazy in front of your house waving a gun. He'll just go away.,1
7484,Thanks. I should have tried a different browser first before posting but this is a new problem today or maybe late yesterday on the iMac. I have read other people complaining about comments not being possible on an iPad and I believe that I do use the desktop site but I will check. Sometimes it's Apple that introduces these problems unfortunately.,0
7485,Marco:  good points.  Especially your last two statements.  How much does a modern WTE facility cost?  Is that a show stopper? Jone: moped racks?  Why can't you hook up to a bike rack?  And I just found out that bikes must be registered.  And pay for a transfer if you sell it to someone.  How whacked is that?  TMG.  Too much government. Mr Bumanglag: you are spot on.  Get your representative to get on the butts of whomever did this and fix that problem.  If more government meant more quality help for our people  I'd be on board.  But TMG means more incompentancy -- and I'm being nice. Randy: good call.  But you're an umpire so you are used to that.  Where's government when you need them to actually do something that someone wants. Melissa: in concept  rail might be a good thing.  But is it worth it?  Let's see...if I don't want to use my car... I have to plan a bus schedule to get to the station; get on the rail (perhaps a good thing); get off at the stop closest to where I want to go;,0
7486,Let me sum up - You have no proof a "fetus" doesn't have a soul  you have no proof it cannot feel pain  you have no proof it has no consciousness. In sum - my opinion is just as valid as yours. How do you like them apples ?,0
7487,You can always spot the ones that have been a coma for the last eight years.  They'll be the ones talking about "bi-partisan" solutions.,0
7488,What people think or how you feel  huh?,0
7489,Maybe if the student loan interest wasn't paying for Obamacare they could afford it.,0
7490," the G&M is still ignoring the 3 credible House Intel investigations recently launched into the Clintons?"  --  That's because  like all the other Congressional investigations into the Clintons  absolutely zero wrongdoing will be found.  What are they  zero-for-seven now?   Mueller is tracking down Trump like a cat tracks a rat that it has trapped in a closed room.  Incidentally  Manafort  who is 68 years old  is facing 10-15 years in prison.  Do you think that  given the choice of  spending the last 15 years of his life in jail  or giving up Trump  he'll choose jail?  He'll sing like an opera diva to keep out of jail.  He owes Trump nothing. Trump fired him.,0
7491,also  not to be crazy  high  suicidal  or stupid.,1
7492,wow -  i would love to see the community donate for these folks - no one should have to lose a home   to help their child into a better life at it's most basic level. this is the child's future - his immediate appearance to those he meets - first impressions are important. he needs more physical space in his skull and amazingly there are doctors that through the miracle of surgery  people  can lives a significantly better life.    there is a path to the situation where the surgery  surgeons  doctors - they whole shebang is done free... for many reasons - but that road is only opened with a connection to the media. somehow  someway.    i think of the millions donated to the U  not counting Phil( i'm guessing with time  his "gifts" with burden the U with maintenance.   there have been some very large donations and research is all wonderful but there are some very basic  real and human needs elsewhere - like here. how easy for one of these lucky  wealthy people to step up and pay $35 000.,0

7495,IRT DeltaDog  your signature hints at serving in the Vietnam delta  and if you did  you know that the UCMJ determines the sentence of a military personal who leaves his post during War.  Yes  he will never be offered a free drink if and when he is released from Federal Prison.,0
7496,Ah a name change doesn't help your all too familiar message of the american victim.,0
7497,'  Trump is an admitted sexual predator. .   He's also a belligerent  childish buffoon and a traitorous and treasonous con man being played by Putin. . Resist Trump. . Resist his agenda. .,1
7498,Looks like a change in strategy was called for. Can only hope for the best. The level of denial out there remains high however- particularly from the valley delegation. Misleading the voters as to the nature of the problem and pandering is not leadership.,0

So now she is adding more debt to your kids future by subsidizing high electricity rates by borrowing more money.  I gotta say this.  In aggregate   the IQ of Ontario voters is about 75...tops!,1

7517,I've read all the comments below and there's one fact that wasn't mentioned:  She's a freaking lawyer!  Most of the legislators are lawyers and none of them can be trusted and should not be in any political office.  They are part of the problem for sure and neither republican nor democrat have the tenacity to roll up their sleeves to conduct hard work; always looking for the easy way out.  I hope they use up all the Permanent Fund and when it's gone  then  and only then  will Alaska have effective and meaningful legislation! Here's some truth about lawyers;  "what's the difference between a dead dog and a lawyer found on the road?  There's skid marks in front of the dog!"  That says it all!,0
7518,That's like saying that the US has a lot to answer for which is also true but China will no more be contrite about its actions with North Korea than the US will be about the mess it made of Afghanistan  Iraq  Libya and Syria for example.,0

7526,A lot of people don't have Facebook pages  sometimes for professional reasons. A lot of Health professionals don't have Facebook for the same reason they have unlisted phone numbers: to avoid being contacted by clients or patients outside the professional context. And also for the reasons that CAELew has mentioned (above).,0
7527,trump is a pig...not to slight pigs.  it's looking lke he's spend the rest of his life in and out of courtrooms defending himself.  sniffle  sniffle  sniffle  snort.,1
7528,Geez  read the article.,0
7529,All of these "teachers" should be fired immediately. We can not have people this stupid teaching our children.,1
7530,Excuses of past failures don't answer the question.  Making what is needed  available and effective is the only way.  Cameras and tickets don't have agendas only proof of violation.  Courts can sort out truths.  I know more than you might expect about the law enforcement aspect  regardless  I know laws not enforced are not laws at all.  No one "makes" any money off tickets (unfortunately)  never the less... at minimum neighborhoods would have actual documented proof of ongoing violations.  Just because something's been tried doesn't mean it doesn't/didn't work or can/can't work again.,0
7531,"Her mind is shot" says the most ignorant  petty fool ever to cross the White House threshold.  Repugnant  repugnant man.  Trump and his cult have done more to permanently lower my opinion of conservatives than any person or event in my long life.,1

7533,Believe it or not  for you Downer Types... people go to County  State and Local Fairs   For the same stuff. Each year it is seen through new/fresh eyes  not to mention the Tradition(s) .,0
7534,I am so glad that we have Coach Rolovich.  Someone recently commented on Matlin's recent coaching hires  and I have to agree 100%.  We currently have some great coaches here.  And not just for what they teach about the X's and O's on the field or court  but about the importance of the effort given to accademics in the classroom  and about civic duty and giving back to the community.  Great job everyone.  Let's keep the UH athletics programs all moving in the right direction.,0
7535,It would be great if everyone could be treated absolutely fairly in every circumstance  and in light of all of the relevant facts. In reality  we have to put the security interests of the other 36 million Canadians ahead of a few misguided youths who may  or may not  have become hardened zealots with treasonous aspirations.   What we can be relatively confident of  is that when they are caught and tried  they will provide stories intended to mitigate repercussions for themselves  and these will include heart-rending stories of challenging family circumstances  youthful indiscretion and  incredible hardship  dressed up in compassion-inducing  lawyerly intonations.  The outcome of that trial is not as important for them  as it is for other impressionable youths who might  but for the stern treatment of these 'young offenders'  consider following a similar path.,0
7536,Kiss your company's ass  snowflake.,1

7543,Thanks for reminding us that BC maybe should not have donated to Fort Mac's fire rescue.,0
7544,Finally a Canadian posting here. I am so sick of all the American Trolls.,1
7545,Stupid Jane Rogers!!,1
7546,How can it be arranged so that the poor earn a bigger share of the wealth?  I'm sure there are a number of ways  but taxing the hell out me because I work very hard and am successful  in order to give that money to others who do nothing in exchange  is a non-starter.  Those of us being fleeced have had enough.,0
7547,I didn't hear Trump say "black sobs" or "African American sobs" I just heard him say sobs. Last I looked white players were kneeling as well.   Trump is a goof for wading into this debate but he hasn't said anything that is racist.,1
7548,"One is his opinion and the other is the truth." . Oh please  they are completely opposite statements! Trump lied when he made one of those statements  which one is it?,0
7549,This kind of article tries to put a balanced face on something that is clearly idiotic. . It is 2017  for heaven's sake. . The S.C.C. decriminalised abortion more than 30 years ago.  The anti-abortionist cranks need to learn to obey the law. . The issue has nothing to do with freedom of speech anymore.  That ship has sailed. . Now it is only about the tortious and criminal harassment and intimidation of women trying to get medical services to which they are entitled by law. . What if hip replacements were against one group's religious beliefs? Would we allow them to obstruct and harass patients trying to get to the hospital for hip replacements? . No  we wouldn't tolerate it for a minute. . 50 - 150 meters?  How ridiculous. . In a free and democratic society it is a disgrace that harassment and intimidation are tolerated  at all. . What we really need to be doing is ending the tax subsidized status of these religious groups that teach against Charter-protected rights.,1
7550,Another piece of useless manufactured junk! May it always remain a concept.,1

7552,Idiot? Is that what was missing?,1
7553,Congratulations  Tom! Well deserved!,0
7554,I support the First Amendment as well as the Second.  Who is the next group Boss Dunleavy and his minions will try to silence?  P.s.  Thanks for the article.  It reminded me to contact my legislator to oppose the bill.,0
7555,So are you advocating that our elected leaders  including Governors  do nothing?,0
7556,Good Lord what a bunch of non-realists. Must be democrats. What the writer said was true  "Seriously  it's shocking how many people will watch people do boring things if it happens in Alaska." That these moronic shows exist to satisfy the masses of the great unwashed shows also the degree to which individuals no longer think.,1
7557,At the end of the genocide the party joined the national unity government.,0
7558,And you are an ignorant  ignorant person.,1
7559,"If North Korea goes ahead with a ballistic missile or nuclear test and the U.S. does nothing in response  America’s deterrence will appear diminished."  When powerful nations show restraint  it's generally considered a sign of strength rather than weakness.  It's easy to bus' um up  hard to talk things through via diplomacy.  Trump hasn't shown any signs of having the strength of character  willpower or patience to do the hard things.  He better start learning fast  assuming he's not already too far gone in senescence or terminal narcissism.,0
7560,What has happened to my America?  Is there really only one answer?  I say no.  Whose fault is it.  It is our fault for NOT paying attention to what was happening  we got lazy.  There was a time when we were involved in government and knew what was going on.  Now that is a thing of the past.  How many of you research the issues or the person running for office beyond the 1st level?  Think about it.  Just my opinion.,0
7561,You're deranged.,1
7562,I got exactly what I expected. A racist response from a coward.,1
7563,My Goodness! These people that were voted into office are acting like sharks feeding on a dead whale! A 'sunset' claus  holy cow! How often has that really come to pass? Do you really think that we- well most of us- will believe that after a couple years this tax will disolve? Sheeeessshhh! Give me at least a little credit for watching how you politicians conduct yourselves. These so called ' lawmakers' are absolutley delusional. You guys just don't get it do you??? The SPENDING  HAS to be cut!! What the hell is imbedded in your little brain that is keeping you from getting a grip on this? Sh!!!t.... Were's Dr. Phil? You folks need help and we'll be remembering this come election  time  so get your resumes ready to tag on like begich to be a 'consultant'.  uuuggh . Really? These polits are sick......we deserve better.,1
7564,It would seem a rational choice to find another job with a higher salary  and moving out of state if necessary. But it is true only if I look at just the economics of the situation. I do have the skills and past experience (before teaching) to try a different career. But my doctor reminded me how much she appreciates my work  since her two sons are in elementary and she is not looking forward to paying private school tuition. I am a product of the public schools and what would happen if so many of us "abandon ship"?,0
7565,A 1 term President.  He doesn't know how to "act" like one!  Lolo!,0
7566,Why pay less?,0
7567,Bite your tongue. we will not be Americans.,0
7568,And people in Canada are wealthy enough to own cars and prefer to travel that way.,0
7569,Five years later DACA was "about to be challenged in court?" That's meaningless. However  Trump's cancellation of DACA is to be challenged in court right away. Trump pushing DACA on Congress is just a cowardly way of playing to his ignorant base.,1
7570,The union hasn't done anything unlawful to base such a suit upon  the right to strike is constitutionalized (I am not aware of any parallel right to postsecondary education)  and the students will be getting what they have paid for when normal relations between the employer and employees resume.  In other words  yes  it is incredibly selfish to suggest an individual interest in receiving services without the slightest inconvenience should take precedence over the legal and constitutional rights of others.,0

7574,It will likely be 53K for Justin and Kathleen  actually.  But no matter.   Beats the crap out of the 2500 they will get from CPP........  The other thing is that the balance in investments can still grow even as you draw down.  And yes  there is a minimum withdrawl each year.  But I think it kicks in at about 71.,1
7575,I've given up getting any sort of unbiased account of the Trump administration from the press.  He could cure cancer and they would accuse him of putting doctors out of work.,0
7576,yeah  I already posted those.  Not even close to what you claim.  Hey  if you really believe what you claim  then you should invest heavily into GM  Ford  and oil companies.,0

7578,Why should the taxpayers fund Ben Cayetano’s personal vendetta?,0
7579,Wow  unhinged doesn't adequately describe you.  You are a true sicko  and I think you're proud of that.,1
7580,Strada- pathetic when the only response you have is to criticize something so meaningless.,1
7581,I bet you are a lonely old white man who just can't accept its 2017 and not 1960. You want to rip her kids from her or force them to go with even though they are USA citizens that 3 more beans out of your proud white america,0
7582,Truth is the Canadian 1% is not making any where near their counterparts in the US are making.  The Canadian left is exaggerating these to justify higher taxes on income earners.,0
7583,Toronto was sold out a long time ago. A building is not a community  it is just bricks.,0
7584,No  I LIVE HERE. The Lobbyists that are lying  harassing and attacking are only making the case better for BC to not allow you here ever to create any mess  since none of you seem to support any citizens here but act for an american company and for china  that pretty much is treason in the books.  I also know that one person have 5 account on here stalking and harassing me. You are pathetic.,1
7585,And you expected Balpreet Singh to say otherwise?  That's like  expecting fast food joints to start admitting their food is basically unhealthy.,0

7590,Why aren't high school graduates applying for tech jobs?  What a strange thought and jumbled analysis.  To get the high average salary they must be limiting the pool to those who have advanced education.  High school graduates who work at tech companies will not ordinarily make the big bucks.  The high school grads will have support functions earning far less than the tech workers with more advanced degrees.  It seems that every time we get an advertisement (or eh an article) from the software tech folks  it is distorted for unknown reasons.  The typical high school grad without advanced training will not be earning $74K in the tech scene.  A college grad with relevant training could.  Why mislead students with false information?,0
7591,Still is ;->,0
7592,Pay to Play nonetheless.,0
7593,Thanks to the Globe and Mail for trying to add some honesty to BC politics when the ruling Liberal party cheats all BCers time and time again.,0
7594,he's not the only one to go off the rails on russia - mackinnon and the globe's editorial staff write mostly nonsense too too,1
7595,Maybe they don't comment because it will reveal the dirty activity of Obama and Clintons.  Perhaps about the Rice-Bill meeting on the tarmac.....?  Maybe some unauthorized wiretapping by Obama and co.    Ask yourself...why did Hillary concede during the election night so fast?  Then ask yourself why trump is silent on investigating her?,0
7596,You present an interesting point-of-view  especially when you frame it in the realm of Anglo-Canada vs French-Canada.  The liberal mindset appears to be trying to impose the viewpoint that this is a simple black and white issue (pardon the reference)  but it is anything but that... the whole issue is full of nuances and shades of grey.  Furthermore  at what point does this cause a negative backlash that is detrimental to society as a whole?  I'd rather not give folks like Steve Bannon and his groupies further ammunition to fuel his so-called right-wing revolution.  The mayor of Richmond's (Levar Stony's) compromise proposal seems perfectly reasonable (middle-ground approach)  yet in the true fashion of today's politically polarized world - he is attacked from both the left and and right.  Sigh!,0
7597,Not with you on the prayer stuff  but gotcha on the rest. What was The Beast thinking? Oh  wait  he doesn't...Good column  Elise.,0
7598,Play stupid games......win stupid prizes. In rebuttal to hottubjoe  this is no different than when a stupid kid goes out and kills himself speeding down a highway. Guns are not the problem  stupidity is the problem  and it is rampant across the nation.,1
7599,This is a nonsensical column. Anyone can run in a democracy. Celebrities are like royalty in our society and as such one wonders why they'd want to enter politics. Ronald Reagan  Sonny Bono  Arnold Schwarzenegger  Al Franken  Fred Thompson and Clint Eastwood have all held public office. Jesse Ventura was a one-term governor of Minnesota.   Some celebrities have been good politicians. Others have been failures. Fame can only take one so far before one has to deliver. And the media takes a keener interest in politics than it does music or pro-wrestling. Trump is a freak or a sport. I'm inclined to believe the Russian collusion story simply because it's hard to believe Americans would vote for such a fraud.  As for Kid Rock. He hasn't declared his candidacy yet. He'd need to win a primary. And the incumbent won by 59% last time. So I suspect this is all a PR stunt. Indeed  I think Trump's campaign was just a PR stunt that went wrong. Sad!,0
7600,The unincorporated communities of Barnum and Petersburg are located within the town.,0
7601,I don't support torture  however  the Laws Of Armed Conflict only apply to members of a uniformed  regular military. Those protections are not extended to members of non-uniformed or "irregular" partisan or para-military force (and certainly not to terrorists). It's a significant distinction. In addition  the rulings of the Supreme Court in the Insular Cases specify that the US Constitution does not automatically apply in conquered or newly acquired territories (e.g. the Philippines or  in this case  Iraq). That may be morally bankrupt  but it is the law  and the Supreme Court should not legislate the law from the bench; they only interpret the law. If you disagree with Gorsuch's stance on torture  write your Congressional delegation and advocate for a law that either directly bars inhumane treatment of enemies abroad  or a law that applies the protection of the US Constitution to our enemies. Regardless  his interpretation of the law is accurate-even if I disagree with it.,0
7602,Yep! Murkowski is a true RINO,0
7603,Trump is a buffoon that has no understanding that will hurt the USA more than it will Mexico; look for severely increased inflation and/or a run to physical gold-now is that what he wants you to do(ie. Oval Office gold curtains?)  Trump has to be in line for the lowest IQ by any POTUS,1

7619,Commissioner Bailey and some of the commenters here seem to have little idea of the structural engineering that goes into rooftop greenhouses. I've been involved in building three large greenhouse spaces 32 000 sf or bigger on roofs in Montreal (which has a larger annual snowfall than Anchorage)  I understand the issues. They are far from "flimsy" and are carefully engineered to manage snow load  wind shear  seismic shift  etc.   The benefits of such greenhouses are substantial. They are very efficient farms and produce  on average  10-15 times more produce per square foot than soil-based farming and while they can provide high-quality vegetable produce all year around  they also provide substantial energy savings to the building below during both winter and summer.  For more informed perspective about rooftop agriculture  the commission and commenters might do well to consult www.lufa.com/en/our-farms.html. We'd be pleased to provide fact-based information.

7621,My mom said  "if you don't have something good to say  don't say anything at all". But  then  I wouldn't get to engage in the discussion regarding the Alaska State Senate. The words that come to mind are evil  cowardly  self-serving  stupid  moronic  did I say self-serving? I have never met a group of people who care less about the people that they "represent" (Alaskans) and who openly  happily live in the pockets of their benefactors (oil companies and other filthy rich corporations and individuals). The author is exactly right - bright  innovative people will not move to Alaska if the schools are bad and we NEED these kinds of people to build a new  vibrant economy. Ignorant Alaskans say things like  "if they don't want to live here  we don't need 'em". You are WRONG! We need all the brainpower we can get to solve our fiscal issues. Clearly the morons in the Senate are not  and have never been  up to the task. They should be ashamed. They are absolutely disgusting.,1

7623,The EU is probably being diplomatic while preparing for the worst. Trump's record so far is that the more outrageous a thing that he campaigned on  the more likely he is actually to do it! The European nations could be stuck with NATO weaponry parked on Russia's borders and a provocation to Russia and the US  the country that had them put there  leaving those countries to fend for themselves. If the weapons are removed  will the Russians seize territory to provide a buffer zone? If the weapons are left there and the US provides no support  will Russia seize the weapons and the buffer zone. Trump's unholy relationship with Putin places Europeans in a very difficult spot.,0

7630,"...as the night dragged on  many in the crowd lost interest in what the president was saying."  "Hundreds left early  while others plopped down on the ground  scrolled through their social media feeds or started up a conversation with their neighbors. After waiting for hours in 107-degree heat to get into the rally hall — where their water bottles were confiscated by security — people were tired and dehydrated and the president just wasn't keeping their attention. Although Trump has long been the master of reading the mood of a room and quickly adjusting his message to satisfy as many of his fans as possible  his rage seemed to cloud his senses."  https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/08/23/as-trump-ranted-and-rambled-in-phoenix-his-crowd-slowly-thinned/,0

I appreciate Bud Black's approach.  Instead of giving his pitcher's excuses  he calls it like it is...if you don't consistently make good pitches  you're in trouble.  Maybe more so at Coors field  but making bad pitches doesn't play well anywhere.  Hoffman's control was awful last night and I'm glad to have a manager that will hold his pitcher accountable for that rather than excusing a bad outing based on Coors field,0
7636,Sometimes there are no right answers. Heroin is a deadly drug  and most of those who use it  suffer and die. Mortality rates are 50-100 times higher then baseline population. There is no cure  only imperfect solutions. You can detox the physical body  but the mind remains hooked for a lifetime.  Physical detoxing is relatively easy. Stick em in a room  or put them on methadone and slowly reduce doses until clean. But the mental aspect... How do you boost willpower? How do you make them forget what it felt like? Most people can't even lose wight by maintaining a diet - and heroin is 1000 times harder.  All resources should be focused on finding a cure for the mental addiction - how to erase the memory of the 'high' from the user's mind. Or flip the memory somehow  turn pleasure into revulsion... Thats the key.,0

Plus the polls for months showed the states she was weak in and that was public information.,0
7640,There was a time when the notion of politics might have been appealing to me  but I opted to try to make the world better in other ways instead. I think I chose the right path.   The way politics are today  with so much heat and so little light  I wouldn't have the stomach for it. Besides  I doubt I could get nominated for any office by either party. For some reason  they're picky about their candidates going along with the party line. Go figure.,0

7642,I agree to a point.   Different times in our history we have adjusted immigration policy to the needs of the country.  At the time Mr. Connolly came  the policy was designed to bring in people with the characteristics needed by the economy.  The labor market could absorb someone with his limited skills.  The problem now is that we have too many people coming in whose limited skills are competing with American or current legal resident labor for jobs a saturated labor market. That doesn't help the country. Coming to the country  giving birth to children you can't afford  and then turning to the government for assistance so you can feed and house them and get them health care is not helpful to the country.  Bringing in elderly family members who can't support themselves  and whose family can't support them  so that they end up utilizing the SSI and Medicaid programs  is not helpful to the country.,0

7660,No  that wasn't the original budget for the airport. It was about $3.4 billion in hard construction costs. A significant portion of the "over budget" DIA was not hard construction costs but additional capitalized interest that had to be incurred during the 14 months of delayed opening. That alone was something like a billion dollars.  The $1.8 billion is the payout over 34 years for the Great Hall project. It is like paying your home mortgage. Over 30 years  you pay a heck of a lot more to the bank than the principal amount of your mortgage. The capital cost of the Great Hall work  comparable to the $3.4 billion to construct DIA  is $650 million  not $1.8 billion. The $650 million is part of the $1.8 billion  the rest being the operations and maintenance payments over 30 years.,0

Canada is hobbled with various political structural issues regarding Chinese investment. Mexico doesn't have that problem to consider.  Mexico will not forget this move.  This move will provide enormous ammunition for the Chinese in future long term strategic negotiations against Canada and the US.

7673,You're poorly informed if you think any 6 month move of the stock market can be attributed to Trump policy.   It was moving in a positive direction for over 6 years.     The only way Trump policy can move the market at this point  is to promise more income through tax reduction to a small minority of American ownership.  See if you can follow this.  A corporation could make ZERO changes to process  marketing  sales... yet go up in Market value based only on short term gain due to lower tax's on realized gains.  NO value added.  This is the problem with American investment and is has been for years.   Stock prices are NOT a measure of productivity/value: they do NOT reflect the true value of a corporation at any particular point of time.   Market's are moved by investor sentiment and it can be very short term.*  *Do you know anything at all about superfast trading?

I think he allows his dislike of Mr. Trump's personal behavior and antics (as do many) to cloud his view on the conservative agenda Trump is pursuing  and spends too much time on that rather than writing about the issues. He certainly analyzes and writes well when he is on point  and often infuriates liberals.

7739,I ask again... Who gets to pocket the 10 cent per bag fee? They adopted the 10 cent a bag deal in California a couple of years ago.  Originally  the grocer's opposed the bill but then state government met with the grocers (including Ron Burkle  owner of Safeway and big Dem donor) and the retail clerks union. A deal was cooked up behind closed doors and the grocers ended up pocketing the fees. Immediately they switched sides and supported the bill.The Dem politicians now get big campaign donations from the grocers and the unions as a kickback for lining the pockets of the grocers. No doubt the clerks got a nice raise as part of the loot. You still see plastic bags everywhere only now being much thicker  they don't decompose as quickly and seemingly last out in the environment  forever.  The clerks hate the law.

7751,Well thank God an election is coming soon. To the opposition parties:  Do something about the Green Plan.  You don't have to cancel it  but you do have to modify it so it makes sense and does not destroy jobs and industry.  1) You could start with reducing the subsidy for green power.  If this is truly becoming affordable on its own (I have severe doubts  but that's for another time) then it has to be affordable with less or no subsidy. 2) Eliminate cap and trade for carbon pricing.  This is not transparent and will be endlessly manipulated for financial benefit.  It asks for corruption as the way forward.  If you need to discourage use of carbon-based energy  go with a straightforward carbon tax.  It is transparent and will allow everyone to plan for what the future costs are since you can actually understand what they will be.  It will still be bad for business in Ontario  but less bad than cap and trade.  Whichever party can present a well-thought-out alternative will win.,0

7761,I became a mathematician because I fell in love with math in Grade 10 geometry  which focussed entirely on proofs. At the time (1960's) it was "obvious" that this developed logical thinking in students  which would be of value throughout their lives. Only later studies showed this wasn't true: kids who were naturally logical loved it  but kids who weren't either struggled and failed or learned how to cope in geometry class without it affecting the rest of their studies; as a result the curriculum was changed. This is a major difficulty with teaching problem solving in one context - it doesn't necessarily transfer to other contexts.  I don't know what the long term effect of teaching coding to young children is  but I'd like to see solid research  not anecdotal evidence. I don't know whether Margaret or Tobi is right  but I don't find either of their articles convincing. Personally  I'd teach algorithms  not coding  and blend it with math and science and other subjects as well.,0

But 30 years is more than enough time to learn the cultural differences between Korea and US  and at least some basic American. I feel for the dogs owner and the little mutt too  but was she unaware that her dog barked a lot? Perhaps a bit of dog training on her part would have been a wise move?

And the Liberals will sign free trade deals that will benefit corporations and the rich 1% as they send work and jobs off shore and provide only temp agency jobs  part time jobs and contract jobs at low wages without benefits to workers in Canada.  And the Trudeau Liberal government will run big deficits and add more to the total federal government debt of $616 billion that taxpayers will have to pay off.

I would argue this defense COULD be better than the 2015 version when Ray comes back and Simmons settles in.,0
7876,This is a great project. Anyone who helps are Heroes to me. Thank you so much. I only wish that I could help. I do my little part and recycle everything that I can. I always look at recyclables or items that can't be recycled as possible art project items. I love Pinterest because there's many projects to do. One that caught my eye was a frog made out of old tires. A little green paint and other items and you have a yard decoration. Lol,0

7878,1. the BOG has that information presented to them  from DWC annually for each P.C. program on the books. they also receive feasibility studies on possible new I.M.. that info is available thought the ADF&G web site and at the office for more up to date data. Rick knows that he just is playcrating the issue  playing on the uninformed. All the information you need to compare to the statue is public information at AF&G. As far as nonconsumptive users on the BOG  that could be an interpretation of the statue. but not likely. why i say that is how could someone be on the BOG who would not comply with all the wildlife statues? (law) If you would sit down and read the statues pertaining to wildlife (title 16) you see it consistently states language to consumptives uses.,0
7879,Putting aside your odd fixation with Gary Crum  the President should not use his office (which belongs to us) to attack an American company for making a routine business decision which happened to affect his daughter.   And suggesting that Obama did something similar is absurd. BHO never used the bully pulpit to advance his family's commercial interests.,0
7880,Trump is a breath of fresh air from the dumbed down Dem /Lib  economics of  politically correct losers. Sunny ways as the Islamic movement invades advancing their agenda to take over. Never mind it is the religion of dictatorial sharia law  killing infidels by hanging and head slicing off  and chopping off body parts if you disobey sharia law. Go Trump ! .,1

7886,Yes  I know. But that in no way alters what I said. And the requirement to reimburse for the taking doesn't change a thing either. It's still taking. If I steal all of your belongings but leave a pile of money for you that equals their fair market value  I have still stolen all your belongings.  Also  being "for the common good" is utterly without meaning  as the courts have decided that "the common good" is such a vague and broad requirement that it can apply to pretty much any situation where the state wants your land. Or even if it's not the state that wants it  but a land developer who wants to build a shopping mall.  Just to be clear  some form of imminent domain is necessary. But it has been seriously abused for years now  and so any use of it is seriously suspect.   And even if a particular use is unambiguously for the greater good  it's still either the state stealing stuff from people or that people don't really own stuff.,0
7887,If this is what companies have to do to hire and retain millennials that is why millennials are not earning a good salary and having to live in their parents basement.

7889,I have long held a theory that perhaps vikings once visited Alaska. If one reads the journal of Leif  Ericsson it mentions the following: A large lake (ancient Lake Ahtna  which was larger than Lake  Michigan?) an island with big bears (Kodiak?) a large river with a great many fish (Copper River?) anthracite coal (Katalla?) an island with flat rocks and petroglyphs ( (Wrangell Island?) Huge trees (Sitka spruce  etc?) an island with deer (Montague?) and so on. I have no idea if they really were here  but it's fun to speculate.,0
7890,Very true..."You cannot have something for nothing." A society cannot condone theft. Anchorage  including multiple churches  offer many programs to help people like him.

7916,Walker did kill the project.  Someone needs to find out what happened between then and now.  Walker has changed his mind on everything.

7917,I know  John.  I was speaking more broadly about our national immigration policies and the current discussion about how to deal with it.  Basically  I want to know why we don't enforce current law.   Is it only because  as is the case with so many other things  we depend too much on the Federal government for funding?  When our fearful leaders allow a culture of lawlessness across various and sundry areas of our lives  we shouldn't be surprised when we get into stupid messes like this.,1
7918,In a Globe article in May  2015 by Adam Radwanski..."Harper’s enforcer: Meet Jenni Byrne  the most powerful woman in Ottawa" appeared the comment  “Part of her thing is a constant sobriety check ” says Yaroslav Baran  a former communications officer for Mr. Harper  who worked with Ms. Byrne. “What are they talking about at the Tim Hortons in Fenelon Falls?”  Margaret writes..."It’s minus 13 C on an Ontario Sunday morning  and the Tim Hortons up at Highway 9  handily located between Orangeville and Shelburne  is doing brisk business.  A steady stream of folks in SUVs and F-150s make their way to the drive-through window to collect their breakfast sandwiches and double-doubles."  East-West Highway 9 intersects N-S Hwy 10 just below (south) of Orangeville...there are several Tim's in and on the 10 bypass beside Orangeville and there is a Tim's in Shelburne  but I struggle to picture Margaret's Tim's  "handily located between OV and Shelburne"!

7920,Eric  HART is undoubtedly incompetent in its management of rail  in everything from design and construction  to management and community engagement. I question however how was the creation of the entity HART made any worse the situation the city now faces.  Were HART not to have existed  I have serious doubts that the mayor  the city council  or any of the city and county departments would have been up to the task of managing such a project or would have done it any better. Or do you suggest that another entity have been created in its place? How would that have improved that nightmare of cost and mismanagement that we now face?,0

"Since the NPT entered into force in 1970  three states that were not parties to the Treaty have conducted nuclear tests  namely India  Pakistan  and North Korea."  " Israel is also widely known to have nuclear weapons."  "According to Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists Nuclear Notebook 2014  the total number of nuclear weapons worldwide is estimated at 10 144."

7947,Uh huh...  "In the 114th Congress alone  House Republicans have introduced more than 400 individual bills that would improve our nation’s health care system."  How many of those passed? They don't mention that in the press release.  I see lots of talk about how great their ideas are but not a whole lot on how it's going to be paid for. I see a lot of it is just re-branded ACA ideas.  Oh  yeah  I see the usual 'block grants' and 'liability reform' ideas as well. Can't leave those antiques out!   The sad thing is all the time lost playing political games instead of just working in good faith from the get-go. Of course when Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said his NUMBER ONE goal was to make Obama a one-term president  we knew how honest Republicans would be working on the nation's problems.,0
7948,If only Trudeau was as smart and had balls instead of a p***y and got that Toyota plant to stay in Canada .

Good luck with that  oh you millennial fools.,1

But it seems the only time he sounds presidential is when he's reading off a teleprompter.

7998,The wheat board was dismantled.  A subsequent VOLUNTARY board was set up and sold to the Saudis.  Last time I checked the board didn't sell sensitive technology to the Canadian  US and NATO military.  The Koch brothers aren't the largest landowners in Alberta  the province of Alberta is followed by the Federal Government. The Koch brothers have leases for a large portion of the oil sands  that's it. Suncor and CNRL each hold leases that are slightly larger than the ones held by the Koch brothers.  Especially since the consolidation that has occurred in the past 3 years since the article you got your info from was written. Even these are dwarfed by several agricultural landowners.  I could care less about Chinese foreign investment in Canada. If they want to invest in Canadian companies and industry then I am fine with that.  What me and many others are NOT ok with is the sale of sensitive military technology without proper and transparent national security reviews.,0

8003,Although I strongly disagree with a majority of Liberal positions  it is inevitable that leadership within our country will alternate between the Liberal and Conservative parties. I accept the fact that approx. 50% of the time  my national leader will be someone who holds views that I disagree with in the majority.  By choosing Trudeau as their leader  when there were numerous solid and reasonable alternatives such as  say  Marc Garneau or Ken Dryden  the Liberals did the equivalent in the cringe-worthy department as the GOP did with Trump.  Dear Liberals  for the good of the country....when it comes time for a Leadership review....please chose an adult next time.,0

8015,Addendum to above: If it is determined that a professional facilitator should explore the "health" of the communication at Page as regards this issue...the bullying "ring leader(s)" would highly likely be identifiable - if "bullying" has in fact been taking place. Anyone who has worked within a group where this kind of toxic aggressive or passive-aggressive behavior is inflicted on others knows the frustration and paranoia it brings to the workplace. Can toxic folk be shut down from within  very hard to do as they quietly create a network of supporters which makes it harder to trust - anyone.

8038,"a strong commitment to NATO "  It's not the home crowed that Trudeau has to convince  it's the U.S. And by not only thumbing your nose at America on the matter but actually lowering your defense spending to .88% of GDP  it will be difficult to blend in with the other laggards as you sit at rock bottom  dead last. If Canada wants to send its troops to Latvia and fight the Russians  that's fine but it has nothing to do meeting your defense budget of 2% of GDP.  Peacekeeping isn't  just stalled. It's a fiasco. The fact that the U.S. is providing your national defense doesn't change just because no one wants to acknowledge it.  Canada is more dependent on the U.S. now than ever and the social programs that you enjoy are subsidized by the American defense budget. Idiotic defenses such as 'Canada has no enemies' or 'America spends too much anyway' don't count. Same thing with 'NATO is for America to do its war mongering'.  If so  why isn't getting out of NATO on anyone's agenda?,0

8058,Yes! I agree. If we use Donald Trump or the Clintons as completely random :-) examples: A tax return would show us Trump is wealthy. We already know that. (Same with the Clintons) A tax return might show us Trump used ingenuity to lower his taxable income  but using ingenuity is perfectly legal  and people who are against Trump already suspect he uses ingenious accounting. (Ditto with Clinton critics) Nefarious dealings with Russia? I don't recall the IRS having a form for declaring nefarious business dealings. So if Trump attaches any form or addendum to his return that shows various complex financial dealings  most of us wouldn't have a clue what the form meant and would base our judgement on our political leanings. (Ditto with Clinton) I fail to see how tax returns tell us anything we don't already know  or can't jump to conclusions on  based on other data.,0
8059,Just another insecure weak white guy  threatened by women and minorities. Yawn. You're a dinosaur  buddy.,1
8060,Anyone who does not realize that Trump's executive orders will be bad for the US economy in the long haul is delusional.  Even though it is factual that a lot of people in the US have been negatively affected by globalization the US as a whole has been a major beneficiary.  A trade war where retaliatory tariffs are levied on everything imported will hurt everyone. Millions of jobs will be lost.  He is the worst kind of buffoon  he is a buffoon with a lot of power!,1

8063,Many years ago I had the pleasure of meeting the British actor John Mills who swore by William Howard Hay's book Healthy via Food. Mills lived to be 97.

I just recalled how strongly he felt about and how he said it had helped him stay fit.,0
8064,"The biggest increase in newcomers will be in programs designed to lure skilled labour to Canada."  How about designing programs that help industry communicate their labour needs to secondary schools and universities so that Canadian-born university grads are not serving coffee while good jobs  including government jobs  are filled by "skilled immigrants" who may or may not actually have the experience they claim to have on their resumes? Unlike for Canadian applicants  there's no practical ways to verify immigrant work experience  so some immigrants are lying about  for example  having accounting experience and filling government jobs  including at the CRA.  How about introducing disincentives for Canadian students to pursue degrees that are not in demand?  Ex. lower interest or forgivable student loans for engineering students; scholarships could be subsidized by businesses  which in turn receive tax credits.,0

It's easily to jump to conclusions without knowing the facts." 1) what close sources? 2) you  yourself  witnessed the physical abuse? 3) lowdell and marshall have kids together already?  - you allude to there (their) "other" children . 4) if  IF  she were falsely claiming a pregnancy to lowdell...to what end? what did she want? - i sure hope you respond. often in these stories  someone telling the "other side" comments  but then responds to nobody who has questions - leaving the "other side" comment-er accuracy looking suspect.    you allege lowdell was physically abusive - that's serious.,0

8074,Not according to the NOAA whistle blowers.  They take raw temperature data and input it into their computer models.  Then if the data doesn't back up their agenda they manipulate the algorithm to provide the numbers they are looking for.  Did you ever wonder why they chose carbon dioxide?  There are much more dangerous gases than carbon dioxide.  I'll tell you why.    98% of the worlds energy comes from fossil fuels so everyone on the planet contributes to carbon dioxide production.  If they can convince enough people that carbon dioxide is bad then they can TAX you for creating it and all the "believers" will go along with the tax without question.  If the hoaxers really believed in this crap they would practice what they preach and stop living in massive houses and flying in private jets.  I guess it's not bad enough to take away our iphone government tracking devices.  Can you imagine how much carbon dioxide is being released keeping our tracking devices charged?,0

8084,"Mother of all Bombs?"  The allied air forces dropped larger single bombs  from Lancaster's yet   during WW2.  The Block Busters were used in urban areas of Germany as well as on submarine pins in France.   There's nothing 'new' under the sun apart from what Americans like to think they invented.   And that one bomb killed 36 people?  At about $90 000.00 per body?  No bloody wonder the US spends to much on the military.  They're just stupid.  We don't need that kind of money ripped from our citizens health  education and safety.,1
8085,they also have smaller ones that Aloha used to fly to outer islands did not take 700 800 or max when I flew from Vegas to Reno that was about the same flying time from Oahu to Hilo  so yes they do have 737s that can go to outer islands where the engines can sustain short trips.,0

8096,As we all know  the State of Hawaii has an immense natural wall.  One of the most immense walls on the planet.  The only way in is by air or sea.  The air and sea routes are protected by the Navy  Coast Guard  Air Force  Homeland Security  local law enforcement... and so on. You attempt to bring in an unauthorized airplane or a ship into this state  you will suffer some very serious consequences.  Without getting into discussion of the history of what us got us to this point  this is the reality of what we have now.  And our current economy is largely based on this wall being maintained very effectively.  From this perspective   I have a hard time telling other people that they are wrong to want a wall too.,0
8097,Trump saving jobs is all smoke and mirrors. He has dwindled an inheritance of 112 billion dollars down to 13 billion.

The supreme court pick is obvious  but whom ever got elected eventually would have gotten somebody confirmed  so not big accomplishment there.  Rescinding executive orders  great.  Economic enthusiasm? dollar is at a low equal to before the election (which helps drive up stocks)  auto manufacturers other than Tesla are struggling. Very concerning signs.,0
8104,Profit in the athletic shoe space is driven almost entirely by marketing - which drives pricing and helps companies like Nike sell shoes for a couple hundred (which are then bought and sold on Ebay for even more).     UA had the unfortunate experience of becoming an internet joke with their first version of Curry's shoe.    NOBODY wanted it.  UA's foray's into professional sports marketing/sponsorships (outside of football) have not been successful  yet.    And I say that as somebody who used to own UA from back when they just made underwear.,0
8105,Absolutely right. I rarely drink anything that comes in a returnable can or bottle  but when I buy beverages for guests  all the bottles and cans go into curbside recycling with the few glass jars and bottles I have accumulated. I don't mind losing 50 cents or a dollar to help support a program that promotes recycling  but I do question the rationale for raising the deposit.   I suspect that a small percentage of bottles and cans winds up in the landfill  and would like to see some evidence showing what that percentage is before the deposit is increased.,0

It works so well to better capitalism.,0
8108,Sorry officer  the lesson here is...if the plane is already boarded and seated  and 4 United crewmembers show up at the last minute and need to dead-head  it is grossly inappropriate to force people off the plane to accommodate non-scheduled employees.  Lesson #2 is  in a free market economy  you continue to up the bid to buy back the seats until someone gives them up "voluntarily".  Not belligerent force and coercion as was the case here  Lesson #3  you don't physically assault someone who is behaving lawfully.  Not cooperating with police is not illegal  if the police have no legal grounds to forcibly remove you in the first place.   This person was not being trespassed by united  you don't go hands on to remove someone to enforce internal airline policy.,0
8109,Not a problem. Just think  America with its unelected president  it undemocratic gerrymandered Congress  it ineffectual Senate  its politicized Supreme Court and its deep need for mass murders which keeps them praying for a different result.

8119,My thing isn't questioning pi. Early this morning i had this troubling dream. i kid you not!!! I was told Iowa has a center i should seek out. I asked how to get there. No one could tell me. So i set out. No map  but kept asking as i traveled. Still nobody could give directions. But i had an advantage  i could fly  flap my arms and up i would go. Eventually i got worn out because no one would give me directions. In deep frustration i woke up. As i puzzled  shortly it hit me  Jesus' answer: "That all may be one as You Father in Me and I in You  that all may be one in us  and that the world may believe that You sent Me." Divinity quest is personal and unique  for everyone's DNA and life experiences are individual and unique. Divinity Self-expressing; no two objectivities ever quite the same; infinity enlarging in particularity. We are different but one and the same in the quest of selfness in divinity consciousness. Viva la difference.,0

8144,Even a broken clock is right twice a day.  And it is right that the PM chose Marc Garneau to chair this important committee.    Mind you  Trudeau should have given Garneau a more senior cabinet post in his initial cabinet and he should have now given him a more senior and challenging post than Transport.  But this role added to his Transport responsibilities is better than nothing.  It is interesting to compare how Trudeau has treated his chief rival in 2013 for the leadership (a race I described at the time as The Space Cadet versus The Space Man) compared  for example  with the way Mulroney treated his former leadership rival Joe Clark.  Mulroney put the national interest over his own ego and offered - and supported Clark in - the key role of foreign affairs minister.  And Trudeau?    Well  Trudeau assigned a secondary role - Transport - to Garneau which  in my opinion  seems a petty and insecure and irresponsible decision.  But then Mulroney was an exceptional prime minister.,0

8147,A tragedy.  And my thoughts and prayers go to the family.  But the mother (whose child was unharmed) in this story needs to explain why she only had a "vague" idea of what the trip was about. If my kids are going to overnight camp  I sure as heck know the details.  And poor or not  a parent in Canada has all kinds of opportunity to have their kids learn how to swim.  My guess is that the teachers were trying to expose these kids to a larger world - to expand their horizons.  To suggest that the teachers are negligent suggests that parents have no responsibility to ensure that their children have basic life skills.  Why is it always society's or government's fault?,0
8148,Great  a double whammy on the poor and middle class. First  the governor cuts the PFD in half  which hurts the poor and middle class much worse than it does the affluent. Now  he's calling for a sales tax  which also hurts the poor more than the rich. The only way to make this fair to the poor is to not tax necessities such as food. How about considering an income tax instead? That will get money from non-residents who work in Alaska but do nothing to help this state. Make the first $25 000 tax-free for all Alaskan residents. C'mon  legislators  step up to the plate!,0

Can I have $235 000  not including bennies?  This is an expensive 31 percent appointee  which translates into what's looking like a have and havemore candidate.  Boy  I wonder what the NEA thinks about that 31 percent pay raise.  I'd be hot.,0

8157,Cargo is hitting .375 over his last six games. I'm not going to use six games to declare that he's finally "found his swing" but he's at least pointed in the right direction finally.  If Gonzalez was 40 years old and a shadow of the player he used to be  I could get behind all the "release Cargo" talk. But he's 31 and still has a lot of baseball ahead of him  he just needs to adjust his approach to compensate for the natural decline his skills are starting to exhibit. Tapia's time will come  but in 2017 Cargo is their right fielder.,0
8158,Jenkins ignores the devastation of NOT having regulations. Remember the Exxon Valdez? Would Jenkins prefer no regulations on the biggest nastiest mine ever proposed - the Pebble mine?,0
8159,You may look at the response I gave to another person. Civics class is meant to teach students such things as The Constitution  scientific election and polling processes  government processes  etc. if the mock election were run properly as an educational tool  the students would have been told several facts including that the results would not be published due to its non-scientific methods. The demographics are not representative of the specified populatio  nor is the group conducting the poll an approved neutral entity. You are correct in that it referenced the results and not the process which would be mandated by the scientific process.,0

8165,Except that OAS doesn't exactly protect against outright poverty.  I'd have to look up the exact numbers  but OAS clawback doesn't start until something like $80 000 per year income an isn't completely clawed back until you have an income over $120 000 per year.  Someone with an income of more than $100 000 a year isn't exactly destitute.  And unless you define poverty as being unable to afford to fly south for six months of the year to play golf  someone with an income over $100 000 per year isn't exactly poverty stricken.  Now I know I would feel the effect of this suggestion after I retire.  But if I was running a government and looking at a place to control costs  I would start clawing back OAS at a much lower income.  And have it completely clawed back at income lower than that needed to but a senior into the top 10% of the population by income.,0
8166,The reality is that Port Angeles does not need air service.  If we did someone would be flying here today.  Some leaders "want" air service  but the airlines will  at the end of the day  do their evaluation and come to the same conclusion over and over.  Service to and from Port Angeles is neither efficient nor effective.  There is inadequate demand.  Increase the population in the county closer to 300 000 and demand may support air service to and from Port Angeles.  Ask the air carriers what will work instead of telling them what you "want".,0

8171,A major problem when supporting a populist democracy is the understanding that the average common voter is too apathetic and too ignorant to truly understand the important issues and make intelligent choices. History supports this statement.  The Senate was to promote intelligent oversight of the activities of the House of Commoners.  Unfortunately the Senate continues to be stacked with members valuable to their party's fund raising rather than their sober thought on behalf of Canada.   Power corrupts. Abolishing the Senate  however  would allow any Prime Minister a virtual dictatorship  especially in a majority government.  An elected Senate with limited terms of service  and reformed mandate and  rules of engagement would be one way to promote a truer democracy and hold the senators accountable to the public. There are many models for how senators may be elected.... a Federation of Regions is one such suggestion.,0

8177,Andrew we all know who the idiot is.  Say are you enjoying the best health care imaginable?  I understand you applied for a job to build the great wall of China on our southern border.

8179,He's a liar.

8184,When one wants to enter a ride one would think that the operator has been vetted for safety which in turn means they are the "responsible party" who keep the maintenance and upgrades as required by the governing laws. If one wants to shirk the "responsibilities" then one should be held responsible by those who enter the ride and those who police the ride. This being the case then operator is going to have to explain why he was not a responsible ride owner which in turn put the safety of riders in jeopardy,0
8185,Price for sf detached here in my city - Richmond  adjacent to Vancouver  - went up 80% in three years  with half of that in the past year.  A 40 year old "tear down" now sells for almost 2 million  and new homes push the 3 million mark.   These prices are not sustainable for those on a local working income  so the market continues to depend on  overseas money  both from new immigrants (Richmond's has a 65% Chinese demographic) and from offshore buyers.  As goes China and our immigration policy - there goes RE prices in my city.,0
8186,Those open air concerts are a billion dollar magnet. If they had even 1/2 the security outside that they had inside the casino. They could probably secure the venue. They have to get smarter about it.  It's a bit too simplistic. But for example. If I had a sniper rifle and knew where the fire was coming from within the first 30 seconds. We are talking over an hour to get through the door vs. a sniper and a detection device.  I bet pretty soon nobody goes into a casino/resort property w/o a weapons check. You couldn't carry alot of stuff to see the outdoor concert. They check for drugs  guns  alcohol  glass etc. before allowing them in the venue.,0
8187,Why this persistent push for a defense if you are going to ignore the offense year in and year out? Denver's last Super Bowl team was quite ugly with no offense to speak of  and it's been downhill since. Mr.Elway: your personnel decisions are really starting to suck. Any idiot can pick superstars out of free agency  but your draft picks have been about as sharp as a marble...get with the program  or resign from your position.

I'd wish Khaled the best in studies  but getitstraight's comment is a reminder that not everyone reads these long articles.

It is current Mayor Kirk Caldwell that has dragged the city back in. At a time when we are burning the most money spent by a city in U.S. HISTORY on a rail transit project.

These people are pure dumb & stupid!! They will never be satisfied & never be able to get their money issues under control on the road that they are taking. First thing is to vote that crook of a Governor out of office along with the other LIARS down there in Juneau that are just throwing money around like its water. I saw a case the other day  the state sent a package with documents to another state office via UPS next day. What would of been wrong with someone taking that package/documents over to the office?? The cost would of been a Hell of  a lot less then UPS Next Day delivery. This was also done in the city of Anchorage. No thought put into a very simple cheap way to get something delivered. The states in a deficit of about $3.5 billion & they can't do a simple thing to stop the bleeding!!,1
8221,Who gives a rats butt that whiny tantrum throwing Canadian leftist Liberals won't attend the official opening?  I am sure Trump doesn't give two hoots what Canadians do or how much they whine about him.   I personally think it was high time a country has  a politician with some b*lls who will stand up to illegals and  leftists.  If one can't enter a country legally they have no right to be in that country.  We need a better politician  in Canada  instead of our selfie taking prime minister who will let anyone and their dog through the Canadian borders.

8238,Yes perhaps   but when lack of words becomes capitulation  another form of repression follows.  There are certain computer software programs that are notoriously susceptible to viral intrusion.  This doesn't make the software innately evil or without positive purpose  but by naming the software  it allows prospective software buyers to be more discriminating and it also helps existing software users to maintain suitable defences against viral intrusions.  However  if the susceptible software can't be named  the virus is going to carve a much larger path  and we'll find ourselves with a repressed computing environment.,0

8240,Re: eastern box turtles (Terrapene carolina  T. triunguis and hybrids thereof):  That happened on a fishing trip through eastern Tennessee  n.e. Arkansas and s.e. Missouri when I took my then eight year-old granddaughter on a fishing trip through those states.  She saw box turtles being crushed on the highway and was horrified--"Baba!  We gotta save the turtles!"  We did.  Unfortunately  what I didn't know then was that adult box turtles become so attached to their home territories they'll continuously try to get back to them no matter how many freeways they have to cross.  We can't release 'em.  Up until 2016 Baba saved the turtles  and they pretty much ate me outta house and home because as granddaughter evolved into a teenager she developed other interests.  She's two days shy of 18 now  has started college  and is getting a lesson in responsibility--her turtles are now eating HER out of house and home (Baba still helps out with the food  but she's gotta clean 'em).  MaSalaam.,0

8244,Legitimate question  always a good thing to start with.    I've never favored the world police role for our country.   On the flip side  it gave us power and a negotiating tool being the unquestioned leader of a dominant military.       Sure  Japan can build a new fleet  Europe can arm themselves  add to the nuclear weapons.  We'll be putting small nukes in the hands of the Saudis soon I expect  at best we're giving them a ton of military hardware to help control that area of the world (even if they don't have American interest in mind 5 years from now)  Here's another question.   Is the world a safer place with America as the dominant military or  do we let the worlds regions chose their own alliance separate from the U.S.        It's a legitimate question  what are the risk/rewards of losing control of military conflicts internationally?,0

8246,Being Canadian   I know that our judicial system provides quite a bit of leeway to people who break the law. People who repeatedly and deliberately break the law  conspire with foreigners to effectively create a coup d'etat  and rob the country of it's wealth is getting very  very close to the line that most of us can no longer tolerate.   If he wants to press this  then I think we need to direct CSIS and whatever other intelligence services we may have  to look into the background on not only the Conservative Party of Alberta  which in and of itself has broken the law  but also into foreign influence  bribes  slush funds  conspiracy to commit election fraud and a host of other grey areas in laws that may apply.,0

8250,"Louisiana  only 14 dead  not important enough."

8251,Eva Klein  I have had the experience of ordering on-line from the U.S. a few times  and to my great surprise  once customs duties and FDX costs were factored in  the total expense almost doubled from the original charge by the merchant.  And I was informed of these extra costs at the door  not in advance.  The shocking total price tags are definitely a deterrent to future purchases.   Thanks for explaining the underlying reasons for this of which I was unaware.   I wonder if NAFTA renegotiations could play some part in changing this.  On the other hand  if these kinds of changes went through  perhaps lots of businesses in Canada would be wiped out as many more people would order on line from the U.S.,0

8259,Ottawa Police rank and file appear to have a serious discipline problem. There have been previous cases of police assaulting citizens without charges being laid. This goes back at least 2 police chiefs. They call us 'civilians'  in order to distinguish themselves from 'them'. Which implies that they think they are military or para-military. But the police forces do not apply a military code of discipline to their members. Instead  they run towards their unions   and if that doesn't work  they can always count on the SIU to make it all go away   except in the most publicly visible and egregious cases.  If they think they are military  then they should act like them. They can start by saluting citizens they approach  like the French Gendarmerie  which was indeed part of the French Armed Forces. It's a small step towards earning respect  and should be a sign of integrity. Otherwise  they should consider themselves civilians  as the founder of modern policing  John Peel  envisaged.,0

The same kinds of imbalances exist in the Canadian constitution  only it's worse here because of the complexities given the number of provinces involved and Quebec's special circumstance vis-a-vis the Constitution.    And agreed the UK is not a two-party state akin to the US.  The Lib Dems are strong in some areas and there are other parties as well such as the SNP and those in Ireland.   There is so little similarity to the US in terms of dynamics that it's not worth talking about -- there simply isn't the same "glorification" of the Prime Minister as there is of the POTUS  and the power of the executive branch is more limited in the UK than it is in either of Canada or the US.,0
8262,In the past three weeks he hasn't had Sanders. Who is the best reciever we have when it comes to separation and sure hands. Sanders is his safety blanket. Also during that time Watson while the weakest link was also absent ... And the weakest links back ups were even weaker. Siemian didn't stand a chance. Tried to do to much and failed. Also we gave up alot of points and field position on special teams ... Putting us down early and abandoning the run. Trevor contributed with turnovers but so did reciever RB and tightend. It's the entire unit. They lost the little momentum and confidence they had and never got it back.,0
8263,Hello stupid people. You elected these idiots. You get what you deserve  ie more taxes and destruction of your way of life. Green belt EH. Most of the land is used to grow grapes for wine. Not really food in my book. The government gave these fatcat generational farmers billions of dollars  for wineries and new crop planting.  The rest of the land is used  to grow corn for subsidized ethanol production. More billions wasted. Another totally useless leftie idea. Wake up!,1
8264,The Governor did send a budget and it didn't include raiding our savings accounts to make ends meet.  The failure of the legislators to raise the revenue to put us on a fiscally responsible path really puts the ownership of the outcome on them.,0

All this talk has become nonsense. It's been working really well in all these years for  BC Libs  Christy Clark  Realtors  Developers  Foreign buyers  and the List goes on  of Cagey and Deceitful Liars that they are!!.  Has anyone even noticed  the city of Vancouver has become a city of glass towers  as if it's a competition to see what the next rich Foreigner can bring to the table!!. Glass Towers....where there was once a Housing Community  where children went to schools and playgrounds  corner stores  parks  ETC.!!!.  WTH!!! PEOPLE!!!

8276,"standing on the side of the road and staring at each other like idiots". That is really harsh. Did you know that when working on high power lines safety requirements dictate that there be a minimum of staff in case there is an emergency? A worker needs to be guided  sometimes by two people. But  there are times when they need to just be there "in case".  And if someone gets electrocuted? Your description of people looking like idiots are trained emergency responderes for such an event.

8293,I have no interest in defending Butts. Why would I? Am I his advocate?  To pretend you weren't implying something is disingenuous. You clearly were  by raising the point to begin with. This is a rhetorical technique the Donald uses frequently. I know paralipsis when I see it. You follow exactly the same rhetorical strategy.   For instance: “I refuse to call Megyn Kelly a bimbo  because that would not be politically correct. Instead I will only call her a lightweight reporter!”   But he's not implying anything-- the same way you weren't  right? Suuuuuure.,0
8294,John Wayne Marina  while beautiful and providing access to the usually quiet waters of Sequim Bay  is not even close to providing the full range of services that a modern marina is expected to have. But if you want haul-out services  need access to marine hardware stores  food markets  public transportation  or want to eat at a moderately priced restaurant than you are out of luck. Even parking for marina slip renters can be a major problem during the summer.   I expect when the rates for slip rental increase to 110% of the average rates of area marinas  we will see some attrition among marina slip holders. Some boaters will move to other marinas and some will utilize their trailers and vacancy rates will increase again. Then what will the rates for slips be?,0
8295,This is so stupid and wasteful AND Grantham and the state GOP are to blame. If Grantham would have agreed to fix this simple error in January there'd be no special session. This is simple error to fix and don't listen to this non-sense about it being unconstitutional  it's clearly fine. Grantham immediately tried to turn his politically motivated  irrational  obstructionism into political hay  by labeling this as wasteful on the part of the Governor. Grantham is the one causing the waste and playing people for fools. How did this person ever become a leader of anything? He shows no leadership at all. Right now that tax revenue that should be going to special districts is staying in the pocket of pot buyers! How does Grantham feel about that? He hates special districts so much that he'd rather have pot buyers not be taxed based on a simple error?,1
8296,Understanding history seems to do little good. People are adept at deciding the present circumstance is really different from past instances.

8300,you don't make sense.  if another freeway were built to alleviate traffic on H1/H2  rather than rail  the building of it must be done by government and not private or corporate interests?  governments do not have in-house construction capabilities.  all large constructions projects are contracted with private businesses.  your thinking is really nonsensical.  hence  the facts that private companies are used to build the rail system  does not mean that they are in cahoots with the private contractors.  if you and other antis have any proof  why don't your bring it to the attention of the AG?  instead of making false accusations.  if you birds don't have any proof than you should not make dumb comments.,1
8301,So how is it that DEC doesn't have a problem with this?  How much $ did Eklutna have to pay to get all the old vehicles out of the ravine that had been launched down there over the decades?

Its a big money grab by someone and they are attempting to fool people into believing its all for  free. I've even heard some con-artists claim employers will not need to even offer employees medical coverage  anymore.  Where on earth do they expect all the money to come from?   I really think this would be a massive transfer of the nations wealth from private hands into one humongous monstrosity that will make all other government programs pale in comparison. Then where would Americans go for decent  care?  Sanders is the salesman  but thankfully he couldn't sell water in a desert  so  until the extreme left finds a better 'salesman' I think we're safe...I hope.,0
8305,i am no longer supporting the Seahawks...of course  so far this season  they've made it pretty easy not to support them but this is the last straw.  When these players disrespect the flag  they disrepect all of us including the people who support the players' position.  This is just a bunch of feel good nonsense that won't accomplish a thing.  And Bennett's claim this brought them together as a team - no  that's not what happened at all...all that happened is Bennett managed to bully a bunch of his teammates into participating in something silly.,1
8306,Practically.  But it is still higher AND it is a rate without a cap. A person making $20 000 of taxable income would pay $1 569 or $1 333  depending on how you file (2016 rates) A person making $47 000 of taxable income would pay $4 080 or $3 844  depending on how you file (2016 rates) A person making $100 000 of taxable income would pay $$8 764 or $8 292  depending on how you file (2016 rates) I could understand your argument if there was a cap  but people earning more are certainly paying thier fair share in Oregon Taxes.,0

8308,Salvage the Rail's proposals underscores and highlights the operational deficiencies  financial and economic shortcomings of the Rail project. Ben Cayetano proposed the BRT  for $1 Million $40 Million of benefits would be realized. Use of trains and tracks  elevated or at street level  is costly and at this point  any added cost  given the time required to recoup these expenditures  is an economic burden the State  C&C Honolulu  and The Neighbor Islands cannot afford. Governor Cayetano's  plan was great when proposed and should be revisited as a value-added approach to Save the Rail from going further sideways.,0
8309,Tillerson and the Trump are having their first face-to-face meeting today since Tillerson called the Trump a "f**** moron."  This should be MOST interesting!

Too bad we lacked this amusement during the previous administration.  We're finding out what we missed!  Keep in mind this is the highest level of government in the United States.

Are you serious? On the anniversary of the attacks on 9/11? Her sons job was not to protect the ambassador  it was to work with CIA operatives out of the CIA annex. Stevens requested over 600 times for increased security and was denied every time. Hillary and the State Department knew full well and had been briefed about the increased security threat and also knew of the ambassadors travel plans. Knowing all of that  the State Department neither increased the security detachment for the ambassador or ordered him to wait until things calmed down a bit. That is just the beginning of the incompetence at Benghazi.,0

8316,I've heard these arguments before.  All I needed was the first paragraph to know where this author was going.  The tree is a mere decoration.  No one is worshiping it or creating "an association of the tree with the signs of the heavens."  You can do what you want  but condemning others for their Christmas traditions is out of place.  Ellen White strikes a proper balance regarding the celebration of Christmas.  Rather than condemning those who celebrate it in good faith  using it as an opportunity to point others to the truth would be more fruitful.,0
8317,"...Since when do business leaders care about "doing right by the country"?..."  Not true.  Go to a Futurist meeting and that's one place where you'll meet many business owners who care very much for the health of this nation and its people.

8325,Judge Roy Bean; I agree with you on being negative on the GW crowd  but you are spouting BS on gas cars using 4x the fuel of a diesel.   FYI smaller displacement gas cars have become very efficient  in the last several years.  After renting a VW Passat 1.8L gas engined car for a few weeks and experiencing the same (90% highway) mileage as I've experienced with diesels  I decided diesels cars were now history.  But this VW cheating has turned me off VW for any car.,0

Grow up  stop being a completely out of touch elitist. There is a Canadian running to be a head of a party that cares about the future of this country and who has made it in this world creating jobs and employing people - that does not make him inherently stupid  out of touch  and Trump like - it makes him a caring Canadian that wants to help.

As Robin Brena explained  if Alaska were getting our historical share of oil revenue  there would be no budget crisis. "Were the state to have received the same percentage share of gross revenues in 2015 as it received in 2012 (35 percent)  the state's petroleum revenues in 2015 would have been $4.8 billion and the state's budget would have been very close to balanced."  Les Gara has also explained that with SB21's new oil clause  the situation of allowing oil companies to take all of Alaska's oil revenue will only get worse "Alaska will take in less in oil production taxes by 2018 than we get from fishing and hunting license fees.",0

8344,No goal  no plan. Really. I've asked this question to myself many times and it's the same answer I keep coming back to. There is no labour shortage in this country (unemployment ripping in the opposite direction of US). I really truly think it's linked to construction/real estate/business profits (eg higher population  higher Rogers TV subscribers)  etc. There is no massive action game plan here. Maybe one thing I will say is that population growth does give a more dynamic feel to society and life. I say this with respect to visiting countries where the population is stagnant. Things seem  on a relative basis  quite staid in those areas.,0

8371,Obviously you are uninformed. The insurance companies limit when you can enroll in health care. If you find in April that you have been diagnosed with cancer you cannot just go out and buy an insurance plan. Also the insurance companies want people to utilize preventative care because catching an illness early can reduce costs for the insurance companies. Many carriers like United Healthcare are implementing free weight reduction programs. You get money back to use on healthcare when you enroll in the program. They send you a scale and help subsidize your monthly gym membership. The insurance companies want to promote healthy lifestyles in order to help reduce costs and the reduce the burden of the unhealthy. Obviously your an idiot if you think purchasing insurance through Amazon is a smart move. That is the dumbest thing I have ever heard.,1

8378,How do you come up with such a insane idea that what Trump is doing (actually you have not even heard his plan yet) is trying to "make America for Whites Only". Statements like that have caused the left to not only lose the election  but caused the left to lose all credibility.  Just silly.,1

8381,It is my understanding that over 30% of  new housing costs are due to various government fees and charges on top of which is charged HST on all materials and labour costs.  Funny governments don't mention or deal with this issue when attempting to bring forth policies with respect to high housing costs.  The basic issue however  is that demand far exceeds supply and until governments deal with this issue  instead of blaming landlords and foreign buyers then prices will continue to rise.   Question why is it necessary for the majority of Ontario's population live in or around the GTA.  There is lots of affordable housing in eastern  western and central Ontario.  Surely in today's digital world there is no need for many businesses and workers to congregate in or around the GTA.  Maybe governments should focus their efforts through tax incentives etc. to encourage business and workers to establish elsewhere in the province.,0

8387,You could write several books on the truth of modern history and the fact that ALL human made ideology is evil. The stupidity of humanity is that they are still fighting some sort of perverse intellectual arrogance that someone one or the other is right or wrong instead of coming to the obvious conclusion of history that Socio-Communism and Fascism are BOTH wrong and both created by a cavalcade of idiots that cared less about humanity. To read the worlds main stream media today  those morons are still arguing the case. This is because they are inexplicably linked to one of these despicable ideologies. This is largely because they went to one of our top education brainwashing institutions that have been infested like vermin by Socio-Communists beginning in the 1920's. The CBC is another Socio-Communist infested cult. While this was true at the end of WW2  Trudeau placed members of his own Communist newspaper Cite Libre in top positions within the CBC and NFB. Canada has no media.,1

8401,O’Malley know how to identify a real non-negotiable value  and he backs up his words with action.  97 companies demonstrate that they won’t defend the indefensible.  Unions need to think ahead to the future where their role will shift from collective bargaining to representing the interests of employee-owners in their craft  including accepting diverting public funds to ownership.  Rules about the economy reflect rather than cause agreement on what to do next.  The changes we need depend on imagination. Economic Justice and the Gift cannot be merely voluntary. They must be a right. Our imaginations need to work on how that would be and we need to listen to others with something to offer in this area  regarless of credentials or affiliations. Indeed  Francis essentially said from each according to his ability  to each according to his need.,0

A few years ago   where I live  in the Austin area  a driver in an SUV purposely plowed into a supermarket and killed 1 customer and crippled the niece of a friend of mine who just didn't manage to make the choice to get out of the way.  Off the top of my head  I can think of another time someone drove their vehicle into a Luby's restaurant in Temple  TX and 23 people were just too stupid to get out of the way of the vehicle and the driver's bullets. It's a miracle that no one died in this incident  and it would have been wise for anyone with a clear shot to assume this was a terrorist and remove the threat.,1

8414,The failure of our political system to address disinterest is just one of many things that shout for reform.    Participant or not  government policy affects effects the quality of life of all citizens. Our representative are charged with representing ALL citizens of their district/state  not just the members of their own private party.      I would start with the hypothesis (not fact)  that our political system disenfranchises people because it does not in fact care or  represent their point of view.     The modern poltical structure hasn't gone through a major reform in my lifetime.  Yet every other profession has to keep up with changing technology  changes in population trends  cost effectiveness..... Why shouldn't we expect evolving methods of governing?  I do get your point though Motely  it's the Noblese Oblige theory  the sense of responsibility by those that lead.  (Look at the time spend fund raising by our representatives - is that constructive?),0

8416,We are infested here in the Golden Horseshoe with skunks  rabbits  squirells possums and there are no natural predators once the foxes where eliminated due to blight and other reasons  hence its the coyotes job to pick up the slack to balance things out.  The only item out of balance is the human race  where Wynn wants to put ANOTHER 4 million of us in Sounthern Ontario  and god knows where from there.  Maybe we can unleash some coyotes down in Queens Park to pare down some of the excess flab that is fluttering through the hallowed halls.  S. Ontario used to be a nature basket of thousands of species  including bears  wolves and the like.  Now we complain and fret about some poor animal trying to survive.,0

8424,Its easy to accuse someone of being a traitor. Especially when no proof is given and you make  irrelevant references to the sacrifices made by family members.    Obama is the traitor. He took an oath to uphold the constitution yet he believes it should be essentially rendered null and void. He like all Libs are statists and it is the Obama's and the Clintons of this world that are the fascists.   TRUMP is none of those catch phrases that you hysterically spew.,1
8425,What a dishonest characterization that is... "Reagan tripled the national debt" the debt under Reagan was 1.8 trillion... 1/5 of what Obama did to us. The debt under Clinton was up 1.4 trillion and you all think of him as the president who balanced the budget (it was the Republican controlled Congress and iRONically Reagan winning the cold war that did it) and Ronald Reagan $.4 trillion away was the man who tripled the debt... There are people who read these letters who will actually believe what you wrote it's a good thing Obama didn't come after Reagan.  A Girl Is absolutely correct in her statement that revenues went up as tax rates went down under Reagan all you have to do is look for it and be smart enough to process it.,0

8434,Size and cost are relative. I believe better decisions (more nuanced  and sounder both now and into the future economically and democratically) are made when a greater diversity of views is represented and boiled down. Diversity works in nature  its creates strength. So  we pay a little more for a sound governing structure  and the house doesn't catch fire  or if it does catch fire there is a fire department close enough to put it out and our insurance is paid up to cover the damage  instead of the place burning to the ground with no coverage. There are many ways to get better proportionality  including those who garnered the highest vote counts for their party but not enough (often  under the current system  in every riding across the country) to gain any seats.,0

As a Packers fan  in light of yesterday's events  I'm thinking they could do a lot worse...they'd have to restructure the offense around a more mobile QB  but then they likely need to restructure the offense anyway (Aaron Rodgers vs. not-Aaron Rodgers).,0
8453,This wasn't supposed to cost the state a dime.... And now it's $55 million. And when Mrs. Heier states that the money comes from a 2.7% tax levied on all insurance plans in the state  and then says its spread out so "all Alaskans pay"she is incorrect. Many Alaskans ( rural and native villages) don't pay any renters  auto  life  or health insurance   once again leaving the bill to the other 50% of hard working Alaskans. This is why an income tax needs to be the last resort in fixing the state budget  only after PFD payouts are ended  and a statewide sales tax with no exemptions is initiated. Time for the other half of Alaskans to pay there "fare share"...  The free ride is over!.,0

8455,FYI my 'complaint' and 'waffling' about 'free bag's was tongue-in-cheek  which I guess you didn't get. We've no problem taking recycling to the drop-off  and have doing it for years. But there is a point  though  that municipal services must be equitably applied across suburbs and one area cannot get better/additional services  except through ward sunsidies  which all wards get.  Your point about '80% of SA' is relevant insofar as service delivery in those municipalities  typically  ANC run  has/is near collapse. Voters should take responsibility for putting the same party in for 20 years - it's not CT's problem.  Don't  in your self-righteousness  make it one; take ownership of the problem. But as I said  CT always had good service delivery - the Divisional Council back in the day was poor cf CoCT - no matter which party ran it. Perhaps it's the culture of 'slaapstad' other parts of SA don't get  ie as a rule we take pride in our city.,0

Then the media publishes one of these thugs getting stomped back's video  claiming he was attacked for no reason. What a fucking JOKE.,1
8459,Canada is a weak country governed by weak and intellectually challenged people. No wonder it is the country that every other country can easily take advantage of  including the US. Even the refugees think so. Among the refugees  it is well-known that no matter how stupid and weak your case is  you will be accepted as a genuine refugee in Canada. That is why they keep coming and taxes keep going up to feed them. No wonder the smart people have all left and joined the US.,1
8460,You are right  and it certainly is not the oil and gas industry. We need to look at a blank current oil and gas lease to see if we need to make adjustments to give Alaska more at the front end of the process. 12.5 % Royalty is not enough for me. Should be at least 50%.,0

8467,Just to point this out Jake.  If Alaska has both a sales tax and an income tax you will get to deduct one not both on your federal taxes.  Some posters have pointed out erroneously that what ever the state does you will be able to deduct the tax.  If you live in a location with a local sales tax  a few Alaskan locations  you will loose the deduction for that sales tax if you chose to deduct a state income tax.,0
8468,Or Trump is right and PR  including the Mayor  is expecting too much. Most  if not all of us  know little about the situation there apart from what we are reading in the media.  And personally  I stopped taking what I see and read in the media at face value some time ago.,0

Democracy has to be transparent to work and we have to be able to trace influence back to its source.  That we can't do that and that there is no hue and cry  illustrates the depths of the problem.

To him  the more buying of houses in Canada using overseas money from ultra-rich people   the better.  He also welcomes any move from government that will further fuel upward pressure on house prices.  He is all about wanting really  really expensive house prices.,0

8480,Neil's points are well taken.  Poor communities sometimes do not see a difference in whether they vote or not.  Community engagement where community members work to improve what's important to them is an important 1st step especially when elected and government officials speak politics and rhetoric.  Voting is an important byproduct of personal involvement and seeing that a difference can be made within your community.,0

That's all I'm saying.,0
8484,Thanks to Donald Trump and his equally clueless Republican politicians for helping bring this amazing convention to Denver! I feel sorry for the folks of Utah who are against Trump's ignorant policies  but if it takes situations like this for the country to realize what a buffoon Donald Trump and some of his fellow Republicans are  then maybe the country will step up the efforts to get Trump impeached. He is completely unfit to run our country  and this is just one of his amazingly ignorant decisions. He's mentally unfit and everything he does is to pad his own bank account. What a joke!,1

8486,Why should the AOAO BOD expend resources  or as you say take the initiative  to develop guidelines and a template to accommodate the needs of a few owners? Why don't the owners who want charging stations develop the guidelines and template and submit them for review and approval? In other words  why should everybody pay to accommodate your decision to buy an electric car? If having charging capability at your parking spot is really economically advantageous  you must incorporate all the costs including these. If not  you are just asking for welfare. The trouble with socialism is that eventually you run out of other people's money.,0

Then you may--but I'm not counting on it--understand that neither I nor any else is protesting because we're "butt hurt" (nice language; did you learn that at Sunday school?) rather  because Trump is antithetical to everything America stands for. Further  Trump is in the midst of settling yet another lawsuit--this time for defrauding old people out of their life savings  among other things--so he's hardly a law abiding or ethical citizen. And people like you put him in the White House.  Why? Because you drank the kook aid about Clinton.  Hypocrite.,1

8509,Jimbo  As usual  you are spot on. Here's some (possibly) interesting numbers. If the voters disregard Blackmon and Arenado's overall stats because of evil Coors Field  then the only fair way to compare them to Goldschmidt is to only look at their road numbers. BUT  if you eliminate the evil Coors numbers from Chuck & Nolan  then you have to eliminate Goldy's Coors numbers also since Rox players never get to hit at Coors in an away game. And to be fair  you eliminate the BOB numbers from Blackmon and Arenado. So  here's the away numbers for all 3 players minus games played at Coors and Chase: AB____R____H____2B___3B____HR____RBI____BB___HBP____SO___SB___CS____AVG____OBP____SLG____OPS 247___35___67___10____1____12____47_____33____3_____64____9____3___.271___.357___.466___.822 296___52___86___16____1____12____41_____25____6_____73____7____5___.291___.346___.473___.819 273___33___79___16____1____17____49_____27____3_____48____3____1___.289___.353___.542___.895  (cont'd),0

8512,Agree with your last sentence  wholeheartedly.  There are some contributing factors that impact your experience: - small business ACA - never completely implemented - one can buy other plans & except for roughly 1 mil folks - most of these folks get subsidies to cover upto 60% of the deductibles - high deductibles......this was expected and varies by state and region where you live.....others actually saw deductibles decrease.  Typically  the issue is greatest in states that opposed implementing ACA - state exchanges  expanding Medicare  etc. - one reason these are increasing is because the Republicans in 2016 eliminated the ACA risk corridors - which means insurance plans had to raise deductibles  From Commonweal - https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/obamacare-not-death-spiral,0

8516,I'm pleased the Commissioners have abandoned this very ill-advised proposal  It was a very  very bad idea and was opposed by Lane County citizens from across the political spectrum. If adopted  it would have surely been successfully challenged as unconstitutional.  The measure would have meant a waste of energy and taxpayer money if the Commissioners decided to try to defend it.    The cacophony of opposing voices was so loud that it simply couldn't be ignored.  In addition  while we'll never see the records of the Board's meeting with the attorneys  I'm quite sure the legal opinions expressed also supported the decision to abandon the measure.    The "box score" on this one is simple:  People of Lane County  1    Special Interests   0    As one of those Lane County voices opposing the measure  thanks to every person who spoke up in opposition to this proposal.

8535,True... the number of farmers and the number of farms continue to decline.  But everyone has to eat  including inmates. The prison farms produced meat  vegetables and dairy products for the local inmate population (Kingston once had at least 7 federal institutions).   Furthermore  the skills that an inmate (or anyone) can learn on a farm are extensive and highly applicable: machinery maintenance & repair  welding  fencing & building  animal husbandry & vet care  feeding & nutrition  milking & sanitation  planting & fertilizing & harvesting  greenhouse work  egg grading  etc.  Plus learning fundamental work habits like rolling out of bed & showing up on time  completing the task you are assigned  accepting responsibility for your mistakes  etc.  What's often overlooked is that many of these guys are doing time because they had a hard time getting along with people.

8543,I'm not a Trump supporter on almost any level  but one thing the Brexit vote and Trump election should tell us is that there a meaningful level of concern for the effects of globalization and immigration on individuals  whether or not we generally think those are good trends at a macro level.   "Elites" and politicians have ignored this and the result has been a pent-up "anger" at having those concerns ignored. Those aspects of Trump's message *will* resonate with many people  whether people think it *should* resonate. Ignoring this perspective would be a massive oversight in my opinion and "elites" need to do a better job of building a case for globalization and immigration while addressing those concerned about "what's in it for me?"  or more importantly "how is this good for me and how will I be helped if it isn't good for me?".,0

8546,The threats from North Korea's nuclear missile program are not directed at either Russia or China  so it's understandable that neither would be too eager to do anything but talk. Russia and China are also the ones exporting oil to North Korea. The governments may be able to cut off legitimate supplies  but North Korea is adept at ignoring and evading the law. Both Russia and China both have land connections with North Korea and ports in close proximity. This would make sanctions difficult to enforce. So  maybe Putin is just being realistic  not "evil"  when he advocates dialogue rather than more sanctions. Make him responsible for initiating the dialogue. We all know the US carries a big stick  but maybe Putin can just get some soft talking started.,0

8549,IRT Satire  fully disagree with your post.  2/3's of the internees were American citizens born in the United States  and 1/3 were Japanese citizens  who most adopted their new country and wanted to become Americans.  The internment was not required  but they were not even close to the Concentration Camps of the Nazis.  For example  the Colorado internment camp provided passes allowing the internees to visit the neighboring towns and shop in the Japanese owned stores  also to communicate with family members.  The U.S. Supreme Court recognized the error and on December 18  1944 freed Ms Mitsuye Endo and all other internees who were never charged of any illegal acts.,0

8551,To prove your case simply state clearly what the biggest most obvious crime or crimes Trump committed and is being investigated for  (for example rape  treason  espionage  blackmail  etc.) and the absolute best top 5 or 10 pieces of evidence and the name of the victim or witness who will testify. A court of law won't accept "unnamed  anonymous sources/ officials/ aides"  and apparently neither will the non partisan voters who elected Obama previously and then voted for Trump and caused his election.  So after half a year please show the non partisan voters   otherwise you may continue to fail to convince them. Eg. the acting director of the FBI was a potentially great witness of what this article alleges  but instead he clearly stated on the record after the firing of Comey that it won't affect or impair their work at all  that no one from the White House or anywhere else has tried to impair or influence their work  and that they are adequately sourced and doesn't need more resources.,0

8558,Atavistic populism in public life  including openness to fantastic delusion  demonization of “others”  authoritarianism & violence  exists throughout history in all cultures but takes on unique forms of expression in each. We see it in the past & currently throughout Europe & elsewhere  including the UK & in Canada.  While usually consigned to the fringes (& and its would be demagogic leaders ignored)  it thrives whenever the pace & direction of social  technological  demographic  economic change leave significant segments of a country’s people anxious  feeling ignored & “left behind” & filled with loads of displaced anger.  A few minutes of serious thought remind us all of many past Canadian episodes of such outbursts and caution that significant discontents need to be addressed currently if further outbursts are to be avoided.,0

8565,Are you kidding??? You're saying that women are responsible for the actions of rapists and you're also saying that men in general are rape opportunists. Only rapists are rape opportunists and not all men are rapists. Is it the smartest thing to do  to get that inebriated? No  for many reasons not limited to rape. Does that make a woman responsible for the actions of another? Never. Where does your kind of logic end? I suppose women should never be anywhere alone at night  should always wear clothing that extends from the top of their neck to their wrists and ankles  should never venture to trust a ride from an aquaintance  skip the party  etc etc etc... if not then she must have exposed herself in some way or made herself vulnerable somehow  creating the opportunity for some man to rape her. That would make her responsible then  yes? NO. Women are allowed to exist and make choices including poor ones without being blamed or made responsible for a rapists decision to rape them.,0

BP discovered and developed most of Iraq's fields. After all that risk and investment they were kicked out. They came back hat in hand stepping back into the saddle for $1 per barrel plus cost. Last quarter they got $17 per barrel plus cost from their Alaska production.100% Of BP's risk in Alaska was more than compensated with lavish returns on investment by 1982. Today BP Alaska produces the oil  pays the bills  and sends what's leftover to BP Global. BP Global has not put one dime into Alaska since 1982. Exxon invested about 1.5 million and has  received several billion dollars as there share of other producers production profits ever since.

8620,No political agenda ? Are you kidding me ? You had Obama over to your house for dinner .  Nearly every story was agenda driven . Maybe you didn't sign off on each story   but you had to know what was going on . Until the day the new guys took over last month you ran anti-Trump front page stories every day of the week.  Sure   the decline of the paper started before you   but accelerated on your watch .   I feel bad for those who will lose their jobs   but feel worse for those contractors who lost their time and money working in good faith for you.    During this whole process I have felt bad for my poor delivery person . This person delivers the paper rain or shine and deserves a better fate than wondering if he'll get his next pay check or not  .   For those thinking the Dispatch is saved--think again.  If Ms Rogoff couldn't save the paper spending  nearly 50 million on it   the new owners with their tiny amount of money have no chance .,0

8622,Yes   it would make me sleep great knowing federal law is being enforced. From the start the Dispatch has been pushing dope use. Over and over they publish glory stories on dope use   and even used to have a column on how to beat drug laws and grow better plants. Today they show in your face photos of the person transporting drugs with a smile her face. Before this they tried to make hero's out of others trying to skirt/ break the law.They gave glowing coverage about the guy offering home delivery with the guy boasting he was only delivering donations--yet when police busted him he had thousands in cash on him. They have tried to glorify the illegal pot clubs and make a saint out of the dope lady who quit on TV.  IF feds don't arrest this lady and put her behind bars   they have told the public transporting drugs is ok in Alaska .You can't transport alcohol so you shouldn't be allowed to transport dope . Liberals want to disobey the laws they don't agree with. Just like with illegals .,0

If one is absolutely pre-determined to hold something against Ab. Prendergast  consider something with greater weight: (1) he investigated Bishop Robert Finn  and rumor has it his report to the Vatican was rather neutral re Finn's removal  and (2) he sat on the VOX episcopal group that approved the English translation of the liturgy we now all endure.,0
8646,@ AncasterMike  I'm influenced by my knowledge of Wente's writings and career (including the blind eye that Globe management turned to her professional misconduct several years ago).

He might look foolish laying out this case when not  recommending prosecution but he might be wiser beyond our thinking because  now he will just be responding to questions "under oath.

This could come out to be the biggest fake-out in  American history and  possibly  the only way to take down a liar and  dishonest government official who is being "protected".

I like the idea of preserving historic houses. Those just can't be replaced  and cause a neighborhood to lose its character. As Denver "gentrifies"  people are pushed out to old  inner-ring suburbs.

8682,Two points to consider here: 1 - Perceived value of the WF assets. 2 - Synergy.  1 - Clearly  Amazon believes they can leverage WFs assets (B&M storefronts) much more effectively than the current management regime.  Based on regional location  they can serve as hubs for a distribution network.  2 - On the topic of distribution networks  that's a core competency for Amazon.  So  will they diversify the product offerings in current stores to include more than what is currently sold there?  Possibly... a Kindle Fire with those marshmallows?  Make no mistake though  this is a deal focused on US opportunities.  Canadian WF stores are residual  and will probably be assessed separately.  Expect any range of decisions regarding the Canadian assets  from attempting to deploy the same model envisioned in the U.S.  to shuttering or selling them off.

8689,"John North  the vice president of finance for Ashland-based Lithia Motors  said the auto retailer would see almost all its profits from Oregon stores wiped out under a tax measure headed toward the November 2016 ballot.  "That's not really sustainable " said North  adding that Lithia  one of the state's three Fortune 500 companies  might reduce its presence in Oregon if the measure passes.  "Everything is on the table " he said.  "We may have to change our headquarters."  North said his firm now pays between $3 million and $4 million a year in state taxes  and he calculates that amount would increase to about $35 million. Lithia operates on an after-tax margin of about 2.7 percent  he said  and a sales-based tax of 2.5 percent "basically takes away all the motivation to do business in Oregon because there is no profit."

8691,"Misdemeanor assault like a DV4  angry men keep their guns." This is a lie. In 1986 socialist senator Frank Laughtenburg attached this rider to a Veterans Affairs funding bill that Pres. Reagon had to pass to keep VA hospitals open. Thus we see the heart of the socialist. If you have been arrested for assault 4 domestic violence  you LOSE FOREVER the right to own a firearm. You have to begin a process through the courts to show you were not convicted and/or did not plead no contest to the charge of A4 to satisfy the BATF. This is just for being arrested. Even if the charges are dismissed or dropped  the same process will have to be followed to clear your name. Of course  if you plead out or are convicted  you will never own a firearm legally again. Owning ammunition is against the law. Even attempting to buy a firearm the seller is supposed to call the police so you can be arrested right then. Know the law.,0

It seems the majors own a monopoly on the few sold out oil & gas agency leaders that bow to the 3 biggest financial contributors who enjoy over 90% of Alaska oil markets  suprise!   Maybe with the new legislators and new Governor we will get help for the Alaskans and smaller investors like Hilcorp and others  it is time to put Alaskans back to work and produce more oil.   The new commissioner Hollis French didn't sign the order maybe it shows all Alaska's smaller oil companies may have a future in spite of Dan Seamount and Cathy Forrester both former employee of the majors  they rule against the smaller competitors too much. I feel they abuse their power!,0
8700,What a crude cartoon. Portraying Bernie Sanders as Lenin? If all else fails  call leftists commies. That worked so well. In the 1950s. Plus  I've now read several times that a Barack Obama lookalike was used in the Central Park production of the play "Julius Caesar"  with no outrage from conservatives. Kay Robbins  Saul Alinsky's only "sin" was to catalogue and state succinctly tactics long used by conservatives and liberals for organizing political movements in this country. Conservatives as well as liberals routinely never let a crisis go to waste  for example. But I do thank conservatives for constantly reminding me of Saul Alinsky's name. Without their constant reminders  this liberal would have never known he existed. And you better believe Karl Rove and Lee Atwater have used tactics just like ones Alinsky described. And  I know it pains conservatives to hear this  but both liberals and conservatives have ratcheted up the venom and vitriol for over 20 years.,0

8705,Frank: The NFL game guide reads "The National Anthem must be played prior to every NFL game  and all players must be on the sideline for the National Anthem"  then  from Pro Football Talk...."While the NFL has no in-game rule on conduct for the anthem  they have commented on the matter. According to Pro Football Talk  the NFL released a statement saying that "players are encouraged but not required to stand during the playing of the National Anthem."  It looks like the National Anthem MUST be played prior to games....that's a stated rule. However  while players MUST be on the sidelines  the reference to "player behavior during the anthem" is prefaced by the word "should"....that's a very big difference. It doesn't read like "taking a knee" is a violation of any NFL rule. Clearly it's contrary to the recommended player behavior  but that's a different thing.

8730,So  clearly the dad came out ahead in that trade. Was it simply a case of misrepresentation or were there inducements? For example  did he throw in a new car  a Caribbean cruise  or a life-time supply of Kleenex?   When you stipulated she be on her ' best behaviour'  did it not occur to you that maybe this is her best behaviour.   It's good she has a well paying job. That means she's gone at least 8 hours a day. More than enough time to gather up her junk  shove it all in rubber-maid containers (which  incidentally  I think is so much classier than garbage bags)  and put it outside the door. At the same time of course  you have the locksmith come by and do his thing. In fact - if you haven't already got one - ask him to throw in a security alarm.   Then you pack your bag and head off to your aunt Clara's house in the Catskills  - a great place to weather the storm. Oh  and of course turn off your phone.   Viola  problem solved!,0
8731,I agree safe zones could work  but only if they would hire a few of the more responsible ones as 'managers/custodians' to look after and help protect the facilities. The main problem would that they would have to be soft on rules or the chronic offenders would never agree to live by rules  they will never try to get help unless it is a soft-sell. So it will never happen - another catch-22.,0

The Commonwealth of Massachusetts was either unwilling or unable to protect Jaime Caetano  so she was forced to protect herself."  His final sentence in the opinion is telling:  "If the fundamental right of self-defense does not protect Caetano  then the safety of all Americans is left to the mercy of state authorities who may be more concerned about disarming people than about keeping them safe.",0

The city doesn't have an audit department in the finance department  maybe an accounting department  but certainly no such auditor.  If they did  where have they been?!

8757,7) given your views of Hawaiian Independence and the quest for independence  how will you be able to work along with others who differ in their opinion or path towards independence? What is your plan to bridge the gaps that separate our people? What's your plan to determine whose concerns are rational and whose are irrational? 8) I agree 100% with your response to question 8. What is your plan to manage the remediation process and what contractors to use? Will you use a kanaka maoli owned firms? In your opinion  are the western ways of come riding zoning and development  in line with our cultural beliefs and customs? And who determines what those cultural customs and beliefs are? Next would you use that income gained from these investments for what? How would you go about seeking the input of OHA board members and determining this? What about the general population? The reason that I ask this question is because not everyone's an expert in this field. Should their opinion count? Why?,0

8764,Good to see that someone recognizes the struggle. We faced the same struggle with our son. I was not satisfied with the wait and see approach and went outside the school system for assessment. We were very fortunate to have an awesome psychologist and paediatrician on our side.  I worked long and hard with him and was his strongest advocate. I never took no for an answer. I know sometimes teachers and school staff are stretched pretty thin but that is something our government needs to recognize. I couldn't let my very intelligent  capable child fall through the cracks because schools are short staffed. He deserved the same chance at an education as all of his peers.  When my son reached high school  he had become his own biggest advocate and he found some very great teachers who recognized his potential. He graduated high school with honours and he is now a successful university student   who talks about pursuing a career in medicine! Good luck to all the other families struggling.,0

8769,Dave doesn’t say anything about this  but this was the first quarter that real GDP per member of the active population (i.e. those 15 years and older) surpassed its 2014Q4 peak preceding the second half contraction. This reflects not so much the contraction  which was mild  but the slow recovery afterwards. Even so  2016Q4 real GDP per capita is just 0.2% above that 2014Q4 peak. It has been a long trip from recovery to expansion  although it seems we have finally arrived.,0
8770,I don't understand why K2 is not more popular. We've known for years (over a decade?) about its potential benefits  yet there is still not enough clinical evidence to warrant its use. Wouldn't it be easy to give women vitamin K2 in addition to calcium and vitamin D  and see what happens? It seems like it'd be easy to recruit patients for such a simple trial. Lots of people are already supplementing  however  badly worded and outdated Health Canada laws make it difficult to obtain K2 in Canada (due to a legitimate limit on K1 dosage affecting all forms of K).,0

8804,(Cont.) I learned that The RCC resonated very well with my personality type.  I learned that The RCC provided security:  it had answers for most of The Ultimate Questions.  I knew what was right and wrong: my prayer book had mortal sins listed on the left page and mortal sins listed on the right side.  I came to realize that praying was almost a biological imperative.  And because of all those things  I tried to return to The RCC in my 40s  in my 50s  & even in my early 60s.  I am now 68 & 'freed'.  And yet up until the last year or so  I would go  when I was upset  to our local Shrine of St. Bernadette and just walk around.  :-)  Would settle me down.  :-)  ////  I am -- & always have been -- very grateful that I was raised RC.  It gave me a lot of good things when I was young  and it was like 'home' for almost all my adult life.  If 'being out there all alone' became too much  I could always come 'home' for a while.

The problem is asides from mainstreet research there hasn't been much other polling.  They show a 3-5 point NDP lead so slight advantage NDP  but hardly an insurmountable lead.  It would be nice to see if other firms show similar or different numbers and then we could make a better guess.  Another way of predicting is watch what ridings the leaders are visiting as that can often indicate which ridings are closest and compare to previous elections and from there you can make a basic guess of where they are at.,0

Not because I think it's the best business model  but because given where we are after 90 years we would be giving up too much ($1.6 billion profit per year) to dismantle it.   . But I would NOT start with the LCBO as the model for alcohol sales.  We are constantly told that the government is not a business - yet here they are setting up new businesses. Premier Mom wants to tell everyone what to do and when and where.  then use the profits to reward her union buddies with $7 million in pizza. . As another poster said ... the gov't now manages alcohol  drugs and gambling.  How long before they are into prostitution and take over all the mobs businesses?,0

As a cyclist  I've found that a small number of pedestrians are oblivious to shouting  bells  and any sort of signal from bikes coming from behind. I'm assuming that isn't you  and you are actively protecting your own safety on trails. That means being alert and when there is a blind corner  realizing that it's not a great place to stop and look at the birds/take a selfie.,0

8830,And yet for the myriad of articles covering the situation around fentanyl  psychological PAIN and trauma  which are known to affect the same brain pathways as physical pain and thus can be somewhat and temporarily ameliorated by substances like heroin  oxy  and fentanyl  are never mentioned as part of the approach to curbing overdose and addiction in general. Victims of trauma  abuse  isolation  poverty  neglect  and stigma are relentlessly subjected to these things and nothing gets better and more people end up dead  incarcerated  alone. We need to ditch the moral crusade around drug use and remember that we're talking about human beings - not addicts  not junkies  not criminals - people.   The solution is not tighter enforcement and policing (the War doesn't work  duh). Safe consumption sights  naloxone  and outreach are crucial. We have to stop blaming and start asking  with genuine care and compassion  why the pain?,0

When the village people's needs arise  we see the NC's cry to the State or Feds for money rather than applying their accumulated wealth to the problem and they have learned well how to work the sub-contractor angle when the State or Fed provides the funding and further fill their coffers from the hardship of their people at the expense of others.  There is a problem here and it is time to find the solution.,0
8849,here we go again....hot dog drivers think they have no rules. flying around corners at full speed  tailgating  speeding  drunk  high  and just plain ol stupid. if you are going to drive  grow up first.,1

8853,Good points.  Maybe we should encourage more families to emphasize American culture along w/ ethnic culture so as to provide a basis of macro as well as micro acculturation.  Traditional American culture I mean; not the new agey stuff.  It's just too weird.,0

I am not you're a liar. Ad nauseum. The trouble with Trump is he is lying before he even opens his mouth. No credibility whatever.,1
8857,Us dumb whiteys haven't got a snowballs chance of understanding all the machinations of that vast ANC gang  of which few if any have proved that they have the ability to run anything  let alone a sophisticated country like SA  which once I seem to recall had the world's 17 largest economy. Face it  we are not wanted at this party. Seems we are considered too stupid to run anything ........... when did you last see white faces at SOE's?

8881,Trump is rather stupid. He should have at least waited until the indictment is revealed before commenting. Are we tired of all the winning? I tend to think Trump misspoke and meant to ask whether we would be tired of hearing him whine every day. It is just another day in the adult day care center at the White House. Lol.,1
8882,Hospitals  Doctors and Nurses all say TrumpDon'tCareAct no good.   The associations opposing the bill—who collectively represent thousands of religious  private  and public hospitals across the country—warn that Walden's bill  the TrumpDon'tCareAct  will create "tremendous instability" in the health care sector and "is likely to result in a substantial reduction in the number of Americans able to buy affordable health insurance or maintain coverage.",0

8887,Do you mean to imply the PF is a gift from our benevolent overlords the oil companies?   Hmm... I always thought it was a mere pittance left over from the "good old days" when they at least paid something for our non-renewable natural resource (that we own)  and we weren't paying them to take our oil at a loss to the state. Something we put in place to create a savings account  and as a measure to keep politicians in check after they blew $900MM in a couple years.  To save time for some folks. I don't care if they say they can't extract at a profit. They have a less than stellar record with the truth to begin with. The current arrangement is completely stupid. My grocer doesn't pay me to take his tomatoes because I can't economically make a BLT. Not even if I call him my "parter " hire his cousin  and promise him a BLT "sometime in the future." It's not socialism  destroying jobs and the economy (like the current economic arrangement)  etc  etc  etc  ad infinitum...  it's just dumb.,1

8892,I was a forest fire fighter in Canada for 7 seasons. Some men were great to work with  and some--far too many--were purveyors of sexism and harassment. Many more were silently complicit.  Reading this article brought a host of memories flooding back that I'd really rather never relive  like listening to my crew boss and his side-kick laughing their asses off about hate-fucking women   then upping the ante with a story of getting a girl so drunk she  passed out in the bathroom stall the guy pulled her into and continued to have sex with  eg  raping her  in the process concussing her head against the steel wall of the stall and sending her to hospital.  Let that sink in. This was just lunch time hysterically funny banter in their world.  Part of me wants to commend the guys who treated women crew members as equals  but  do we really need to praise what should be a given? To the ones who spoke up against the BS  thank you.,0

8895,Makes one wonder if Justin even has a moral compass. I would have thought that the outrage in Ontario and the distrust of the Clintons for pay to play would be a loud enough message. Over 20 posts so far and only one Liberal apologist who says it is wrong but minimizes the story by claiming other parties do the same. Trudeau has certainly topped all comers though by getting a statue for Daddy.,0
8896,They could have. They didn't for the same reason the Liberals didn't. It was easier to leave him there and violate his charter rights.,0
8897,Aloha Eric! The Honolulu Weekly was on the left  and they are no Honolulu Weekly.  The Socialist Worker is leftist.  CB is kinda radical centrist to libertarian overall.  They have a reasonable gamut of reporters  columnists  and letters/editorials  but maybe in the current political climate they *seem* leftist.  Heck  I remember when Hillary Clinton would have been a liberal Republican  Bob Dole was an arch conservative  and Ronald Reagan was considered a looney right wing nut (remember the commercials from when he took on Pres. Ford?),0
8898,You'd be kidding yourself if you think there weren't plenty of pro-lifers within the Liberal ranks.,0
8899,Kathy you are still mistaken.   If a doctor sees a patient in consultation they are entitled to a fee from MSP for said consultation.  If the patient  or the patient's lawyer acting on her behalf then later comes forward and says  we would like a report on YOUR patient  please address the following issues etc (ie did this shoulder injury get sustained by slipping and falling on ice  how severe is the injury...)  the Dr is COMPELLED to write that report  and charging a fee is reasonable  this is not a covered service.  This happens very frequently.   If Dr needs to bring patient back in just for the purposes of completing the report  then no MSP should not be charged but the initial consultation fee is still valid.  If the Dr is charging MSP for what is an INDEPENDENT medical exam (ie Dr not treating physician) right from the start then that would be inappropriate. Generally is this is the case it is quite clear to the patient and she would sign a consent form before IME.,0
8900,RINO?  That would be amusing  especially as I'm not a member of the GOP.  "Conservative" does not equate to "Republican".  IMHO  the GOP has not campaigned or governed conservatively since they embraced the moral majority in the 80's.  They sold their souls in that deal and have fallen further since.,0

8904,Get your facts straight. The city did not pay for the Nenshi lawsuit.  Paid by Nenshi and people who believed in him.   You know what  I am very happy that the home builder was exposed.  Now they have a taken an alternative route by propping up Bill Smith who won't release his donors list.  Soon enough Calgarians will know the truth.,0

8907,This is getting scary.  Domestic failures are being smokescreened with big stick international behavior.  Against lunatics (Assad and Un).  One thing for a Kennedy to stare down the Soviet Union directly across the table.  Or even for a Reagan to wag the dog in an "invasion" of banana republic Grenada.  Quite  quite another to make big body against dictators with end stage rabies.   I fear even Bush II's invasion of Iraq will be viewed as "better days" after Trump is finished.,0

8909,Aloha folks. At this point isn't all Rail news REALLY getting tiring? Same B.S. time after time. If it's not good news then it's NO news. Just about all of us would rather read something more positive in Hawaii. Which isn't much these days. What made it worse for me is I read this article.,0
8910,A number of brief ideas; 1)More (specific) example based (impartial) breakdowns of a given companies financials...step by step discussion including GAAP vs non GAAP etc etc... Maybe profile 2 companies a month  2)WAY more discussion on the debt levels (and resultant finance costs) of various companies  3)WAY more (example based) discussion of the various preferred shares and reset dates/terms...rachet vs floater etc etc....there is total confusion out there Should be a monthly column  4)WAY less analyst PT based "reviews" of stocks and (as in #1) more advice on how to value them  5)The bond market (in general) gets 1/4 the coverage of the mortgage rate stories...this is a huge part of what makes the equity market tick...  6)Way more articles helping those who (for whatever reasons) just want to use MF's as an investment vehicle...(many do) I find they are not specifically discussed at all which is quite odd.... Surely the top 20 or 40 could get the occasional shout out ??,0
8911,The grainy photos they release to the public are not the ones They use to find these idiots. Those photos that you see are not for your assistance. They have clear pictures and use that to confuse not only you but the morons who are in the "grainy" picture.,1
8912,This posturing is entirely unnecessary.  Horgan is already laying the groundwork for capitulating on TMPL  and most anyone following the file recognizes it.     Kenney's posturing isn't actually intended for Horgan or the BC population.  It's targeted at UPC members who will be voting for its leader.  He wants to look tough and show he'll fight for Alberta.    However  such puffery may backfire.  The conservative majority in Alberta are not looking for unnecessary or empty rhetoric.  He's just making Brian Jean look like the most reasonable of the two.    TMPL has a winning hand.  There's no need for Kenney to be bluffing.,0
8913,Too stupid to figure out how to turn them off. This man is a waste of skin!,1
8914,I find it  pathetic how left wingers  (which we laugh at being the stupidest people in the world) are crying over proposed tax cuts claiming more debt but smaller growth in it compared to obama's rate of debt increases which are record setting!   see loser trump is LOWERING the annual deficits from obama  its a good direction,1
8915,The freezing cold these refugees face is nothing compared to the cold heart that belongs to Drumpf  the man with Nazi DNA in his veins.  Fortunately Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said that refugees can come to Canada regardless of what religion they practice.  As a Canadian  I call upon all Canadians with a spiritual heart and conscience to stand behind the prime minister and show that horrible man in Washington that Canadians will not be swayed by his hateful authoritarian rhetoric.  We will not normalize this cursed man.,1
8916,I have sympathy for those overcome with nostalgia for the Cold War.    Not much  but some.,0
8917,Good comment Andrew.  Don't worry about Alceste he has posted some pretty stupid things lately. Last week he had some real doozies.,1
8918,I believe sodomy is also illegal in Canada still (section 159) regardless of the sexual orientation of the couple.   Just saying....,0
8919,Congratulations to Justice Abella!,0
8920,Read my comment a little closer.  I didn't say all of his assistant coaches had a lot of experience.  Sure there are some who have none.  But there are others who have 20 years or more.  There was just a feature article about it in the RG.,0
8921,But it's still ok to have an admitted sexual predator pervert as president? Why is pedophilia not ok but sexual assault acceptable in the twisted republican world?,1
8922,It's all relative by  his meaning and experience. WHy all the leaks from the Comey investigation but never a leak when Comey stated Trump not involved?  This was the only fact never leaked  why don't you anti Trumperters ask why this is the case?  Secondly   it may be a rainy day but its also a sunny day   Relative in relation to are you on the ground or in the airplane.   Boils down to personal experience. Trump's experience with Comey is totally different then the leaks Comey allowed into the media except for the one issue of clarification which was kept hidden.  As Comey stated   TRUMP NOT INVOLVED.,0
8923,typcial nonsense of our country  you have to know french is pathetic,1
8924,Bronson  I don't think compounding a potential risk with another risk is a good justification - that's like saying  "hey  some edible food contains trace amounts of carcinogens anyway  so let's just pile more on there - it can't get any worse!"    My analogy highlights the basic issue  which is some people just don't want an added risk/hazard in their life  so  they'll protest it.  I believe they have every right to do so.    I believe you are wrong in your assertion that the Sioux want DAPL money and that's why they are protesting - that's been the far-right's disinformation in order to undermine the legitimate claims that the Sioux have.    If the Sioux wanted money  they would have taken the hundreds of billions in compensation for the Black Hills  which they did not do.  For the Sioux  their stewardship of the land was more important than money.,0

8949,How many reading this hit-piece are going to form opinions without knowing  much more  than what’s being spouted by detractors? Detractors are as indicative of rightdoing as they are of wrongdoing. If you dear reader remain intent on weighing Mr. Bannon’s character in judgement  do consider some of these less publicized  facts about him to place upon the scales  along with the oversupply of mongering & opinion: Graduate of Virginia Tech; master’s degree in National Security Studies from Georgetown; Master’s with honors from Harvard. Served 7 years in the U.S. Navy as both a Surface Warfare Officer and special assistant to the Chief of Naval Operations. Been an investment banker at Goldman Sachs. Been a Hollywood producer of 18 films. Oldest daughter is a 2nd lieutenant in the 101st Airborne Division & graduate of West Point.

8953,Mmm  this has the not-so-figurative effect of real quantities of blood on their hands  now. What kind of government does this to its own people? At best  this sells some people into a new economic slavery. You have to stop and ask yourself  what magic is this that they lead people into believing this makes their lives better? The real tragedy is how this is going to express itself in those real lives. And for what? Spite and avarice?  This is final evidence and proof that something fundamental about this government has failed. It's working against the people  not for them. Isn't it the most perverse thing you've seen? It's like having a fire department that goes out and burns houses down rather than douses them.,0
8954,Poor Michael Chong.  First he proclaims his support of carbon taxes and now he sneers at those who were protesting Comrade Notley's unchecked vandalism spree aganst the finances of Alberta.

8955,What's the difference if it's legal? Weed is out there and has been out there for many many years. We already know how things work with it being illegal  time to try something different with it legal. Colorado doesn't seem to be making national headlines with society collapsing or a dramatic increase in weed caused DUI deaths. I don't use weed but I don't mind that it has been made legal.,0
8956,John Evans was not the first territorial governor of Colorado. He was the second. William Gilpin was the first governor of Colorado Territory.  Robert Steele was the first and only governor of the unorganized Territory of Jefferson  which is what the first white settlers called Colorado  from 1859 to 1861  before President Buchanan signed the law creating Colorado Territory.  Also  to say there is a town named Chivington is to not understand Colorado. Take a look at "Chivington  Colo." There's nothing there but a few falling-down abandoned buildings  one house and a few mobile homes on a desolate stretch of Highway 96. It's not even an incorporated place. There's nothing to re-name  and no method of doing that.,0

8970,Vaccines are a medical intervention that come with risk.  It is not just immunocompromised individuals who can't or shouldn't receive vaccines.  Each year there are thousands of children seriously harmed by an adverse event associated with a vaccine - in addition to some deaths - but the media rarely talks about those kids.  Only complications or deaths from "vaccine preventable" diseases are allowed to be talked about  are deemed important.  I can't stand the hypocrisy.    Families who feel that their children are at a higher risk of a serious adverse reaction  whether it is due to family medical history of autoimmune conditions or a parent/ sibling/etc who previously had a serious adverse reaction  should not have to fight for the right to make the medical decision that is best for their family.  And FYI  kids who are home-schooled have plenty of interaction with other children.  They are still involved in sports  go to church  at the grocery store  at the library  at the pool...,0
8971,You don't understand though Gordon. There's nothing to hack. The Russians either have those emails already or they don't. There's no reality or scenario where Trumps comments could seriously be viewed as encouraging espionage because there's nothing to spy on at this time. At the worst he's just asking for the Russians to give us back those emails that were deleted. There's nothing illegal  or damaging in there  at least there shouldn't be.

8988,While the Three Sisters Wilderness  for instance  contains 448 square miles  the land actually heavily used is much smaller  consisting of trails and lakeside primitive campsites. That's where the hikers go  and that's where the labor of upkeep is concentrated. A fee for this special use is appropriate.  When I first started backpacking in designated wilderness in 1972 at the age of 25  I would not see other people for days at a time  and I would have a whole lake filled with trout to myself. I left no trash  no footprint. Now the situation is different  and it is good that so many outdoor enthusiasts see the wonderful mountain sights I was so privileged to see in my youth. However  with the crowd come costs in cleanup and maintenance of trails. Those who can afford a tent and sleeping bag  and a decent backpack and hiking shoes  must also expect to pay a fee for the human wear and tear on trails and popular camping areas.  There are so many of us  and so little wild country left.,0

That is extremely dangerous  given the extreme paranoia of some of Mr. Trump's supporters.

9000,This is a terrific  thoughtful article that clarifies many of today's social conflicts.  I'm surprised no one has commented on it yet; perhaps because it reads  as arcane as a sociology lecture! And rightly so  as many former sociology students will recognize that much of the theoretical base of this essay is drawn  from the classic German sociologist Max Weber.  Weber disagreed with the  unidimensional view of class created by Karl Marx  which based all of one's "class" on our occupation and wealth  our "relation to the means of production."    In Weber's multidimensional conception there were three variables here  generally seen as wealth/income  status or social lifestyle  and power.  Trump's appeal to the white working class is more about status and lifestyle than economic class issues or power..       Though income is highly  related to education  high education  tends to lead to social liberalism while   higher income tends  to lead to  economic conservatism.,0

9003,Many Canadians are unaware that in the immediate postwar decades  federal and provincial governments funded "Homes for Unwed Mothers" in every Canadian province. Over 300 000 unmarried mothers were systematically separated from their babies during this period. Mothers report verbal  physical  psychological  and sexual abuse in these homes  and the Canadian government has so far done nothing to acknowledge these wrongs.  Origins Canada advocates for a Committee to Investigate such as the one held in Australia to uncover the  illegal  unethical and human rights abuses in adoption policies and practices in both Indigenous and Non-Indigenous contexts. This type of inquiry may serve to validate the lifelong psychological and intergenerational damage to families by draconian adoption policies and practices  and to provide mental health and healing services to those denied them so many years ago.

Getting wind of it now  and publicizing it  is part of the mandate of free press  and the service they serve to citizens is invaluable.  Rather than scoffing and denying  and making false and exaggerated conspiracy claims  people would be better to use their own critical thinking skills  evaluate reports from various sources  and do their own analysis and evaluation.  But whatever you do  taking the word of duplicitous Donald Trump and any of his dissembling alt-right supporters is not ever going to get you near the truth.,0

9012,One should think though  that a business should be able to pay its own bills and not rely on state or federal government to pay for internet service. You do realize that through special programs and cooperation with providers like GCI  millions -- yes millions -- were spent to bring communication infrastructure to rural Alaska communities. So the connection is there but everyone else in Alaska should not be on the hook to pay the monthly service fees for internet.  You choose to live in that community. If it's too expensive  you have the freedom to move. Where there's a will there's a way. If I live to Florida and complain I'm too far to visit family in Seattle  that's my own problem  not a state government problem.  Life is all about choices and from your last rant about how often you get out of Unalaska  that is no one one's fault or responsibility but your own. You made that your home  deal with it or move.

No one does know what effect  if any  the Russians had on the American election and that includes Trump.  Given that  and here's the point of the article  The Donald shouldn't be shooting his mouth off about the intelligence services  on whom he will be soon depending  and dismissing these reports out of hand.  If he feels that he can't state that he would like to get to the bottom of it  then the most he should do is remain neutral.  But he is incapable of doing so  of course  because these reports cast doubt on the legitimacy of his election victory and we can't be having any of that  now can we?,0

Demanding celibacy of young men who proved  again and again  that suppression of sexual energy leads to violating those vulnerable to their predation.

9064,ronto1: I believe you're correct in some aspects but I also think those who rent condo units need protection. Harris' crew gutted Ontario's rent control laws in the 1990s on the premise that the changes would spur rental housing construction. The succeeding two decades have demonstrated that the approach has failed. Further  most of the new rental housing that has been built is for high income tenants. Many renters are relegated to the condo rental merry-go-round and even previously affordable pre-1992 rental buildings  like the one in which I live  have inexorably been transformed into high-rent housing by means of other loopholes including the "above-guideline increase" scheme and the unlimited ability of landlords to increase rents when units are turned over to new tenants. The government needs to take a look at the entire rental housing industry with a view to addressing both supply and affordability. No effective rental housing policy can view either in isolation.,0

9096,Heimbuch  you crack me up! The chances of oilcos leaving Alaska are near zero until they've squeezed every last drop. Why do you think that their revenue numbers are so closely guarded? It's not that it is for the claimed proprietary reasons but for its magnitude.,0
9097,Have you seen it? I haven't and can't tell if you are being sarcastic. The caption says it is 62 feet. That sounds tall to me.,0
9098,Yeah Comrade RTH  I bet Russian women like you....LOL....,0
9099,LOL. Trump and corporate America loves people like you. "I am offended. We Canadians play by the rules  even though no one else does." I can see them gloating as the thousands of jobs go south. There is naivete  but there is also stupidity.,1

9105,So called conservatives! What did you think you were getting when you got together and voted in this little imp? Yes she was a little wacky but our city would be in much better financial shape had we ignored the cheap political assasination executed against Amy and done the right thing. Hope you establishment hypocrites are happy!,1

9111,BTW  the Right to Lifers never want to "win" this issue by limiting abortion. If they do  their usefulness as a GOP front group ends. And if you are responding to this to say it is not so  kindly disclose your party membership.,0

9113,so any any anybody that says life in prison with no chance of parole i'd say uh give them the death penalty,1
9114,Nope... many single working mothers have no help from family and friends. The best they have is someone who can wakeup and feed the kid while they are at work. There isn't much interaction in this type of family.,0
9115,They are different cities with different geography.  Housing has been completely and utterly detached from Vancouver's legally reported economy for decades.  Vancouver pays far less than Toronto  with less white collar jobs available.  BC Real Estate has nothing  whatsoever  to do with Vancouver's economy.  This is a global oligarch's vacation pit stop for money laundering  not a prosperous Pacific Rim metropolis.  While Whistler is a tourist town for Canadians and Washington state  Vancouver is a tourist town for Oligarchs  criminals and dictator's kids.  Locals are viewed as "workers" for the rich boys and unimportant to the provincial government.,0
9116,Making donations public is the right thing to do. It sounds sensational and groundbreaking but in reality after the initial searching for peoples' names it gets old fast. By election time this website will be the least used website in politics.,0
9117,Blame men.  There's always an excuse to blame men for the failures of women.,1
9118,And what does coal mining have to do with what I said  ("Let ACA implode. It will  and no bailouts")  and you responded to?  Oh right ... it doesn't.  'Digression ' a favorite failed tactic  when one cannot possibly counter with any facts.    Not to worry Richard. 2020 is just around the corner.,0
9119,If being an idiot gets you thrown out of Canada  better back up the boats!!,1
9120,Another completely idiotic from one of the barely literate trolls.,1
9121,I said it doesn't have the sound  not that it wasn't descriptive.  IMO  "Triple Double" has an awkward rhythm and strange juxtaposition of consonants - linguistically  again JMO  it sounds odd.  And  again  it's very close to an existing trademark. Not ideal.  You disagree  which is your right.  Yes  it describes the burger  but precise descriptions aren't always the ideal marketing tool.  Otherwise Big Macs would be called "Double Patty Triple Bun and Some Cheese".,0

9128,Criticism of Clinton harsher? LOL! Let me at that despicable piece of human garbage. Hillary  the thief   shouldn't be allowed anywhere near the White House.,1
9129,Your idol is as ignorant as his supporters who don't know the difference between hate and a hole in the ground. See you after the election.,1
9130,My observation of this Presidency is it is all about Mr. Trumps hatred for President Obama.....starting with the birther "movement" and thru to Obama's humiliation of Mr. Trump at the dinner ( from Trump's perspective) Mr. Trump just wants to damage the legacy of President Obama  and he doesn't care how that may or may not affect the USA as a country  this is a personal vendetta Presidency and nothing more...from a mental midget.,1
9131,Agreed. It is so sad that we are going from extraordinarily amazing and competent people in the cabinet under Obama to a load of idiots under the head idiot. To have someone who actually has at least half a brain (Murkowski) voting for these brainless morons is disgusting. Sadly  Republicans care more about padding their pockets and winning for their party than they care about this country. Bad times are here and its only going to get worse unless some of the Republicans realize that they do love this country more than their party.,1
9132,Good to know that the rest of us don't count.   The EEOC was created to oversee  compliance with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  This law was passed in response to the Civil Rights Movement that started in  the late 1950s and culminated with MLK's 1963 speech in front of the LIncoln Memorial.  No doubt that MLK would be sorely disappointed by this law's current enforcement.,0
9133,They are all guilty of serious dereliction.  Their machiavellian intrigue is burying this state by taking options off the table every day.  This fiscal crisis will require a multifaceted solution and any such solution is now demonstrably beyond the capability of our legislative process regardless of who sits in those chairs as long as they insist on caucus/party lockstep behavior  grant defacto veto power to committee chairs   and they exempt themselves from open meeting law.  While it only took a few old cunning war horses meeting behind closed doors to orchestrate this escape from duty by our legislators; they could not have done it without the silent passive agreement of their fellow legislators.,0
9134,Fire walk with me is a feature film  while the seasons are 45 minute long episodes. It is a bit confusing  but you should definitely watch in release order so that’s        Twin Peaks season 1 (1990) Twin Peaks season 2 (1990 later that year) Fire walk with me (1992) The Return (2017)        I personally think the order you watch it matters a lot  and they are kinda separate from each other in the way that each is presented  but they’re all part of the same continuous story. Hope this helps.,0
9135,Legal perspective????? And yet when a pipeline has been negotiated  (including the aboriginals) approved and parties change their minds later they can block the pipeline.   I don't get it.,0

9139,Actually he said I hope you can let it go. Hoping and demanding are complete opposite spectrums. Hoping is not illegal.,0
9140,I like the stone tablet in the park in front of  the Oregon Capitol Building which is supposed to be from one of the first opening prayers of our early Legislature.  The pastor  speaking about the legislators  said  "Forgive them Lord  for they know not what they do!"  Some things never change!,0
9141,Seems like a pretty stupid situation.  If the intent was to provide the funding in the original bill - why be whiney babies?  If they think it was illegal - pass it and let the courts decide.  Now the taxpayers have wasted the money for the general session and it hasn't been resolved.  Stupid.,1

9149,Time for some new campaign material Gary. You've successfully drilled the mental hospital figures into everyone's head to the point where we couldn't forget them if we tried. Continuously patting yourself on the back saying "I told you so" isn't doing anyone any good since you're only solution is to just close it down. Maybe you can elaborate on your plan and perhaps write a new editorial on the subject? I know you're very proud of your other editorials and can send them to anyone who was unfortunate enough to not read them. So if the hospital closes  where are the patients going? What can the state do with the building? This is your baby  Gary. Enlighten us all with your infinite wisdom on this topic.,0
9150,The CPMF in Brazil was a disaster - drove transactions off shore or into the black market  pushed up the borrowing costs of Government and Companies and did nothing to reduce volatility in the exchange rate  one of its intended purposes.  As soon as money flows went into reverse  it accelerate the plunge  meaning inflation ended up being considerably higher than it would other wise have been.  It may be technically easy  but it is highly distorting  - sadly Brazil is the home of highly distorting inefficient taxes that do long term damage to the economy,0

9156,IMHO this is just dumb/risky... Next thing you know the company posts a great earnings surprise.....you and 5 Million other lemming's are all trying to get out of the same rat hole at the same time...lots of fun... The next day the shorts pile back in...etc etc  Shorting a stock "because every one else is" ... ??? Just as dumb as buying stuff at the top because its frothy. Obviously if you have some REAL inside knowledge early it might work....but usually you are # 10 000 to find stuff out and  buy into the position...way too late.,1
9157,Oh  yeah  Trump's people are having private  confidential meetings with the Russians  maybe disclosing state secrets and endangering US intelligence operatives  not to mention lining their own pockets and selling political influence.  But never mind all that. Come on  people  just think. Those emails. Her emails.,0

9162,The reason most people don't care about Trump's ties are because most Democrats didn't seem to care when it was PROVED that the Clinton camp and the DNC rigged a primary election. That's way worse than Russia spreading fake data on Facebook. No Dems  including Clinton  will take responsibility for rigging the election process  but we're supposed to be outraged about fake FB stories? Clinton was an unlikable  proven criminal with a enough skeletons to fill an airplane hanger. That's why she lost. (Before you start with the name-calling  I didn't vote for Trump. I'm just pointing out the hypocrisy).,0
9163,Wolf!   WOLF!!!! Just where is that dratted old wolf anyway?,1
9164,What a thoroughly disgusting comment. You do neither Israel or yourself any good at all with comments like this. What a complete loser.,1
9165,You are a liar.,1
9166,If "Mr." Reese has a problem with "celibate old men"  why should we listen to this "old"  cranky  modernist Jesuit {redundant?} at all? The Church has a "problem" with young people because---wait for it--they are  by and large  more conservative/traditional than this pathetic snowflake Vatican II generation. They see the rampant abuse and distortion of dogmatic teaching and the confection of the Sacraments {particularly the circus-game show atmosphere to which the Novus Ordo Mass so often devolves} and want no part of it. On a humanistic level  can't say that I blame them.,1
9167,No  it wasn't. It was very pretty. I still have it and I wear it often.,0
9168,My bad for wording...Typically when a player says I am open to be traded...that's public speak that he would like/hope to be moved and has probably had internal conversations with the front office. It's hard to blame the guy either way.,0
9169,The reward for the Trump campaign accepting the Russian government hacking of democratic emails was a Russian-friendly White House. One only need observe Trump's recent behavior with Putin during the G20 for affirmation. Trump still neither accepts that Russia was responsible for the hacking nor plans to penalize them as a result. He publicly states he wants to work with Russia even though Putin has grabbed the Crimea and supports a callous leader in Syria.,0
9170,But Amy  a secret religious fanatic  alters the experiment.,0
9171,Some do.  Some don't.  Most of the former slave states (i.e.  Jesusland) are teeming with white trash.   The basic formula is as follows:  Guns + Bible + Walmart + Budweiser + NFL +Registered Republican = White Trash.,1
9172,"The other collision course is with Canadians. Polling among Canadians has shown a dislike of Mr. Trump and belief that his policies are wrong-headed. They do not share the seeming enthusiasm business leaders have for him. "  The business community does not share the seeming enthusiasm business leaders have for him/Trump. How very "surprising".......NOT!!!!  The Canadian business led by the Fraser Institute will cheer on anyone that can bring the nation back to the 1700's with no environmental policy/pollute at will  no workers rights/minimum wage  no social programs and no  government regulations.   Those were the day  the 1700's were certainly "business friendly"  and lets face reality  Trump is bringing an already sinking and deeply flawed United  States back to the 1700's. Guns and all.............  Enjoy Gents......,0
9173,Actually KK has two lives here on this forum  one as rambling GOP apologist KK and the other as Richard Rymer rambling GOP apologist.

Shannyn always brings out the best of both split personalities.,0

9178,I'm your Huckleberry... and this is just my game.  First.  You cut ALL Administrations by 20%. ALL.  Including DOT and DHSS.  Then  after those 5 000 State Union employees are done and gone  you cut all capital projects.  Then  you cut ALL revenue sharing.  CBR fills in the rest for three years  while you recover the savings.  BUT CUTS ARE THE ABSOLUTE KEY.,0

9182,It`s not to Walker to hold these people accountable. They are protected by the separation of powers  It is only for the voters of his district probably with a recall.  But realistically?... It`s kind of like the illegal republican gerrymandering done here in Alaska that led to the SB21 vote in the legislature passing by one oily vote.,0
9183,Alaska is a non permit state for cc. What does having the kids with matter?  Anti gun ? Yep,0
9184,I'll bet that a fair number did do exactly that  give the middle finger to the establishment and it's supporters  but when you believe that you have nothing to lose...crumbs from Obama's table just wasn't enough for those voters. And there were those who weren't keen on Hillary's confrontational attitude with Russia  in Syria( and elsewhere) with the heightened risk of a shooting war...and after so many years of war are getting tired of paying the Neocon's tab with their blood(many are in the military or have family members who are). Then there's Obamacare... and still other reasons that make sense to those voters if not to you. Trump may be lying thru his teeth on his promises  time will tell  but at least he gave them the time of day unlike Hillary who simply labeled them and wrote them off. Calling them stupid for having a difference of opinion is juvenile  highly arrogant and totally unproductive IMO.,0

What if it was a fast-and-furious type operation (recall the FBI was selling guns to connections of Mexican drug cartels to see where they ended up) that went bad? . What if someone figured out it was a sting operation decided to kill Paddock first and also send a message? . What if his "gambling" was money laundering plain and simple? $5 000 000 income playing video poker? Right.  . What if any government agencies involved decide that the public "can't handle the truth" and want to cover it up? .

9195,Numbers don't lie  but you certainly present them without context  in an attempt to mislead your audience.  Wind and Solar combined are expected to produce less than 1% of total world energy this year.   Installed capacity is a theoretical number  based on 100% perfect conditions.   Real energy generated by wind and solar is closer to 5% of "capacity". Electricity grids cannot function well when more than 25% of electricity comes from intermittant (unreliable) sources.,0
9196,Liberal talking points now focusing in on professionals with net incomes over $150 000   who reduce their personal income tax through CCPC by employing and paying income to family members.  But  there is no accounting for the intangible emotional burden on all family such as  business pressures  economic downturns   mortgaging jointly held assets  along with supporting and maintaining the reputation and goodwill of the business.   Unfortunately  the LPC  election platform tax policy is based on a highly theoretical 2015 study  co-authored by University of Ottawa Professor Michael Wolfson  called “Private Companies  Professionals and Income Splitting"  https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/income-splitting-used-by-high-income-professionals-for-decades-study/article24583084/?ref=http://www.theglobeandmail.com&,0

9202,Criticising what he did is legitimate but he broke no law. The Ethics Commissioner told him that he did not need to put his assets in a blind trust. His problem is not having declared his real estate holding company in France on time. (Appointees have 60 days to declare all of their assets from the day they are appointed.) That's it!

9236,Denominator - I read much better than you and I also can see.  I don't see China cutting off ALL trade with NK.  If you can read  the article also says "Trump also said China was imposing major banking sanctions  too  but there was no immediate confirmation from the North’s most important trading partner" - i.e. they haven't done it yet.  Banking sanctions also do NOT mean "isolate and impoverish Kim’s government" - China still supplies 90% of NK's needs and China "has resisted cutting off its critical oil supplies".  The article also says "Foreign Ministry said China has always fully implemented U.N. sanctions on North Korea but opposes “unilateral” restrictions imposed by another country on Chinese entities".  That means China is NOT "on board" with the sanctions.  You must be reading what is inside your miniscule mind.,0

9238,The definition of shouting has alway been a voice issue and a loudness thing! This is a new definition and rule  made by who?  I am just doing what others do like J.Frank Parnell do to express strong points  I like it when he does it. He is communicating better with me! Should I tell him to not type in capitals anymore! It does not hurt my ears or anything else  I am confused!   I will try to conform to your wishes and refrain from typing with emphasis using "caps" that is now defined as " shouting"!   Should people stop shouting at ball games too?  Sometimes I like shouting  so should I stop shouting when I feel the need to shout?,0

9249,Another failure in reading comprehension attempting to divert attention from the facts of the comment to more Alt-Fact lies.  No illegals voing in our elections proven over and over again by national investigations.  DNC nominating actions are unrelated to the rigging of the national and state general elections by the Republicans through disenfranchisement of entire blocs of voters in select states to ensure electoral success over popular votes.  The enemas are wielded by the Republicans throughout the nation as they purge the citizenry of their right to vote resulting in the mental blockages currently infecting the governments at all levels.

The US should not just be some "Open Space"  ready to give out square footage to any and all humans who happen to dwell upon the earth and who want to set up shop here with strictly their own culture.  Immigration policies that foster that effect a disaster; it's a recipe for failure  and Europe is learning it the hard way  and we (some of us anyway) are too stupid to absorb the lessons learned.,1

9260,I'm working on empirical evidence (US statistics) and extrapolating that into the probability of getting a better result in a more complex geological environment. That's with an insular focus on the potential for recovery only.  When one adds other factors which realistically - from a commercial risk view - should be taken into account such as the increased cost of working  water supply issues in SA  community resistance  lack of readiness and ability of SA government departments to manage this  increased costs to local  regional and national government and the (now well documented) community health issues  it appears to me  to indicate a non-starter - (once again within the context that (a) SA doesn't have an energy crisis - it has an Eskom crisis; and (b) we have other sources for gas if that is really what we need for economic development).  A simple argument  I know  but is there anything in it that you can support?,0

9266,What is missing from these news reports are the reasons Deputy Attorney Rosenstein recommended Comey's dismissal. His memo needs to be distributed and debated.  He says  "... I do not understand his [Comey's] refusal to accept the nearly universal judgement that he was mistaken. Almost everyone agrees that the Director made serious mistakes; it is the one issue that unites people of diverse perspectives." The memo goes on to quote criticisms of Comey's actions in the Clinton email case by former Attorney Generals and their Deputies under Presidents Ford  Clinton  G.W. Bush  and Obama. Rosenstein says Comey's mistakes were: 1. assuming command of the Justice Department without authorization and undermining the A.G.'s authority by announcing that the case should be closed without prosecution.  2. Holding a press conference to release derogatory information of a subject of a declined criminal investigation. 3. Justifying the public announcement of the newly-found email messages.,0

9294,He was there a few weeks  totally unprecedented. Can we all acknowledge the corruption that has piled high so fast since  January 20 that you need a rocket just to get over it? The WH team was put together with almost no care in the world to qualification or suitability. Who in their right mind would put someone like Flynn as a national security adviser - someone who called Islam a cancer that had to be excised from its believers?    Why is Trump holding Situation Room meetings at his club in front of the public? He is literally giving state secrets away like candy to anyone who passes by! Waiters could be foreign spies and Trump wouldn't even know. How dare he rake on Clinton for her emails  this is way worse! Hypocrite!   At least Obama had the good decency to vet his candidates properly and make sure they were QUALIFIED for the job. He also wouldn't hold a top secret meeting in broad daylight. Trump is treating this government as a complete joke  clown makeup and all. Disgusting.,1

The idiot Trumpster is falling for it  Cruz swallowed it hook  line and sinker as have the Never Trump folks. Just elect Hillary already you idiots!!  The Trumpster is the poster child for NOT PC!! Most people with half a brain & who are intellectually honest don't buy into how 'offended' people say they are by what the Trumpster says.   The biased media demands it and stupid politicians looking out for their own best interest (i.e. McCain) get all righteous and PC and take the bait!

9348,So  the Senate was prepared to act without a professional assessment of the financial status of PERS.  Have they bothered to request an assessment of TRS?  The article contains nothing to indicate one way or the other.  Sadly  I think I already know the answer.

9351,And those wonderful Republicans in Congress are so ineffectual they have a national candidate directly opposed to all of them. It seems even Republican voters expect something a tad more than "no!" from their conservative elected officials. I especially had to chuckle over the Republican budget just passed: loads of unfunded mandates  something that hasn't occurred for over a decade  in direct opposition to the rules. Yeah  that's true conservatism.,0

9356,That is one of the most idiotic titles for an article that I have ever read  "...Russia goes from foe of U.S. to friend". No  Russia is not our friend  has never been our friend  and will never be our friend. They have a leader (Putin) who is at least a thousand times smarter than the soon-to-be leader of the U.S. (Trump). They are going to buffalo Trump and use him to suit their interests at every turn. It will not be in the best interest of the U.S. or the world. Russia doesn't give a damn about clean air  clean water  reducing global climate change  human rights  or anything that is important to a healthy future of all citizens of the world. In that way  Putin is as idiotic as Trump. They have the idea that if you poison the biosphere that somehow they'll be able to escape the effects because they are rich. Haha  the joke will be on them (and us all). No  Russia is going from a carefully watched foe to a foe that will have free rein over America  thanks to the chump  Trump.,1

9362,Obama knew it was flawed  but it was the best he could accomplish given the power of the insurance industry over our legislators who never cease bending over for them at our expense. He pushed it through as is because it improved things for many people even while it made things worse for middle-income families. That making things worse is ugly for those of us it hurts  but Obama knew that it  will be what finally pushes this country past the propaganda fed to us to keep us enslaved to the insurance and pharmaceutical industries. When we are devastated enough  we will finally wake up and join the rest of the world in improving our healthcare payment system for all of us.,0
9363,Agree.  Just like Ah Mow's outfits should not matter  Melania's outfits do not matter.  What matters is that  regardless of what she wears  she won't hold Trump's hand because she loathes him.,0
9364,For those of you who keep repeating the "throw the bums out" mantra: expanding somewhat on a question asked of a caller by KFAR's Steve Floyd the other day  are the tax bases of the district's two boroughs sufficient enough to where they can afford to be represented by someone who is likely to wind up in the minority?  Or is Westlake in a position to write his own ticket?  With the support he received from the Democratic Party  I would be inclined to believe that he's destined for the minority  because I'm not so sure I want to drink the Kool-Aid the Democrats keep pitching on here and probably countless other places.,0

9366,Assuming that "similar site in Eugene" is Opportunity Village  perhaps the mayor of Medford should pay a visit to the neighbors of OVE before he jumps in with this thing. He will find that there is regularly rubbish in the street outside OVE that clearly came from their residents. He will find that several neighbors have grown weary of picking up bunches of used hypodermics. He will find a number of those "no trespassing" signs that indicate the owner had requested the police to arrest anyone found on the property.   In short  the residents of substandard tiny houses don't tend to make the best neighbors. It takes a lot more than a dry place to reintegrate a person with anti-social habits back into civilization.

The incompetence is vast  and that will come out with an investigation that the people can both believe in and rely on.  Until then it will be devisive forever.  This needs to be cleared up once and for all.  The perception of everyone is that this thing is wildly out of control.  In fact it is not just a perception at this point  it IS out of control.  Perception is everything.  Having the same foxes in the henhouse that ate all the chickens to do an assessment of the problem is not going to work.  The evidence is everywhere.  Just listen to the people.  To prove it it needs to be forensically audited and the only ones that can do it is the FBI.  Mayor Caldwell can't do it  nor can anyone else at this point  because nobody trusts them.  They are all fighting with each other. Therefore let's get the FBI on this and correct it asap.,0

9408,Wayne Jones - I don't think the Russians cast those votes; American citizens did. Given the very dispersed way in which we count the 51 statewide popular-vote elections that determine the POTUS  it's unlikely the Russians were able to tamper with the actual vote counts (maybe in Pennsylvania where they use voting machines).  What is it that you don't understand about this? The EC conducts 51 POPULAR vote elections for president. The candidate who wins the majority of those POPULAR elections wins the White House. This time  because the cities control the unConstitutional popular national vote  there is a disparity between the Constitutional election's outcome and that of the media fantasy of a unitary election. THERE IS NO NATIONAL POPULAR ELECTION! It's all made up in your head. We've never done it that way  nor should we ... although you are free to try and get the Constitution amended to put the federal government in control of our elections for POTUS. Bad idea  but go for it.,0

From now on  victory will have a clear definition. Attacking our enemies  obliterating ISIS  crushing Al Qaeda  preventing the Taliban from taking over Afghanistan and stopping mass terror attacks against America before they emerge."  That's a pretty tall order to accomplish quickly with only a few thousand troops. As for "mass terror attacks against America " there have been none since 9-11.   What about smaller terrorist attacks  like mowing down pedestrians with truck? What about attacks against our NATO allies and global partners who are expected to contribute "with additional troop and funding increases in line with our own."  https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/21/world/asia/trump-speech-afghanistan.html,0

Again  I don't know how to make this any more clear  someone above me cited the exact text but it's right there in writing: " Bond payments (which would include interest) would be paid from stadium revenues and private donations (of which there is at least ~$60million)".,0

The overall inflation rate did rise from 2.1% in April to 2.5% in May. The RPI does provide a breakdown. The foreign holidays inflation rate went from 1.0% in April to 2.1% in May while the UK holidays inflation rate went from 7.2% to 6.4%. So foreign holidays contributed to increasing the inflation rate while UK holidays contributed to reducing it  but for reasons unknown the UK holidays inflation rate is still much higher than the foreign holidays inflation rate.,0

This would be especially true when trying to impress new coaches with "how hard they work."  There should be no surprises for anyone in these comments.  Coaches should realize this.   For years  yeah  decades  the U of O has had a very solid weight/fitness program supporting football.  They've had a very strong  fit team at all positions.  Face it  over the years of running the famous "hurry-up" offense  you'd better be in condition.  In fact  one of the purposes of that offense was to "out-condition" the defense....make no substitutions  make them stay on the field  and run them into the ground.  So  IMO  it would be both inaccurate and unfair to criticize the strength/fitness program run for years by Coach Radcliff.    The new regime has started off with a very serious mistake.,0
9488,A couple points not included in letter:  1. Architects  engineers  builders and enthusiastic citizens could attend the 6th International Hemp Building Symposium  Italy  Oct. 10-11  2016.  See HempBuilding.com     Grow an Oregon-PNW Economic Green Building Renaissance!  Two young aspiring Idaho men have crowd funded for an inaugural hemp commercial building  - see Hempitecture.com   2. Regarding the use of the word _non-toxic_:  lime binder is used in the production of hempcrete. Toxic  lime needs to be carefully handled (double pair metal gloves  mask). Magnesium Oxide is being used in some fiberboards. I hear Magnesium Oxide could be used instead of lime to make hempcrete.  3. A few Oregonians  raised money to  fund research by a WA university in the 90s on medium density  fiberboard made with hemp. It was keynoted at a UO event.  Inability to secure raw material was a reason the company was unable to raise enough funds.  Some nations are already using panelized hemp construction.,0

It us nuts that these civil servants represent over 20% of the workforce in Canada  and all have nothing but good plated pensions. Time to reduce the numbers and the benefits and if the Government of others want my help to close the gap  give me a call as I work for nothing and have lots of great ideas; which all would be very acceptable to the people paying the bills.,0
9492,This is the most ignorant thing I have read all year.,1
9493,Sine  cosine and tangent are three basic trigonometric equations you'll need to know.,0
9494,You are still missing the point... I actually was paying $10 a month  for more than 7 years  for my graphic Design class projects  for ebay logos  for professional websites...All ruined...7 000 photos gone from clients professional portfolios. Including my professor's online resume. These are NOT photos of kittens or random images of nothing.  Professional graphic designers from all over have been paying  photobucket for hosting their professional photographs. Paying an additional $300 a year is not acceptable for those who have already been paying.,0
9495,And apparently you are not aware of the science that exists proving you wrong. Gov organizations are notoriously politically biased and this group (U.S. Global Change Research Program) is full of people and organizations with an agenda. Every model  every prediction  every scare mongering used by the Global Warming alarmists have been proven wrong. Science is about looking at a hypothesis and testing to see if the testing matches your hypothesis  it doesn't  it never has. To make the absurd claim that it is settled science when you are faced with these results should tell everyone that these people have a political agenda not a scientific one.,0
9496,How embarrassing  the cops getting ripped off. Great use of taxpayer money.,0
9497,I'm incredibly skeptical that anyone would seriously expect both the BCHAF and a doubling of the foreign-buyers tax province wide to be introduced. The BCHAF model advocated by Davidoff has always been an alternative to the foreign buyers tax. The Green Party platform advocates the foreign-buyers tax. The NDP advocate the BCHAF model.  Personally  I find this article slightly irresponsible because poorly communicated policy forecasting will only contribute to contagion in the market.,0

9501, It's stupid,0
9502,The funny thing about property taxes is that if you are savvy guy/gal  buy an old house and get it classified as "historical"...then you only have to pay $300/yr in property taxes. There are 250-300 properties on island that fall into this category  most of which are assessed at  over a million dollars. If you cross reference the list of historical properties listed online with the C&C property tax website a number of them are also listed as residential A  meaning that a house assessed at two million dollars in the residential A category would normally pay $12 000 in property taxes  but only pay $300 if it classified historical. I wonder how many of these historical property owners contribute heavily to the election campaigns of the mayor and city council members in order to keep the $300/yr dream alive.,0
9503,I have a guess that during the "hour or so"  it was up someone saw it  felt it was a threat and reported it to UO administrator Sandy Weintraub who then went on line and looked at it to see if students or others were being threatened.    Based on his conduct in high school  where his lawyer daddy also came to his rescue  and this series of events  he may have both a big mouth and maybe anger management issues.,0
9504,We just got forced to give money to a belief system preaching planned parenthood which believes a child is nothing until it breaths air and that homosexuality and promiscuity are fine  even transgendering.  Wake up people!  Belief systems abound and need to be exposed.,1

9506,That's a completely ridiculous conclusion to draw from my comments and you know it. As usual you're trying to pull my chain. By your logic  you have a license to kill. Your children have a license to kill you  along with every one of your neighbors. When you come down to it  little prevents anyone from killing anyone else but their personal moral compass and the threat of retribution  and many times that isn't enough  for a thousand murderous gringos for every one murderous illegal immigrant. Nice try  Mr. Crew. Almost funny  but not quite  given human nature.,1

I also looked for a CDC connection between cats and rabies and couldn't find any. He mentions he is a biologist 'by training'  which means not by practice. A google search turned up a blogpost mentioning 'a' degree in fisheries biology  so he probably has an unused BS degree. Hardly an expert to be listened to. Rick Sinnott  who is mentioned in this article  actually retired from a career as the state biologist. He seems like more of an expert to me.  I don't know why ADN continues to publish this. Doesn't journalistic integrity apply to the publisher as well as the writer?  http://www.adn.com/commentary/article/community-cats-are-community-hazard-and-dont-deserve-special-treatment/2014/07/07/  http://www.adn.com/commentary/article/we-dont-need-any-more-feral-cats-no-matter-what-propaganda-says/2015/10/16/,0

9573,My wife was quickly admitted to emergency with kidney stones a few weeks ago. 40 beds and only ONE emergency doctor.  Yes  one.  And this at 12:00 noon. After 2 hours of excruciating pain in that emergency bed  a nurse finally took pity on her and got "permission" from that one doctor to adminster a morphine drip. But what's also odd  was that there were about 12-15 nurses at the nursing station seemingly doing paperwork and discussing the upcoming Christmas party. All this to say  the whole system is as sick  if not sicker  than the sickest patient. Top-heavy administration is putting everyone's health  and life  in some cases  at risk. And  until governments have the gonads to shake the pencil-pushing tree  and do a massive re-org  from the top down  nothing will change.,0

We cannot forget lest such injustice return. Yet while remaining vigilant against injustice  we should not create more injustice. That is about to happen to Ms. Shurtz. Some who have known her testify that she is no racist. Others including colleagues who may not know her well or at all call for her long and productive career to be ended. That would be a shameful injustice. Allow her time to reflect and apologize  then forgive her. Is that  after all  not the goal of racial healing? Or is intimidation a better tool for healing than forgiveness? I think it is not.,0

9590,There's a difference between confidence and overagressiveness brought on by insecurity. Trump is a childish authoritarian with a fragile ego. He goes a wee bit irrational over things like his alleged small hands and the sparse attendance at his inauguration.  His unhinged tweets are how he releases his tension and insecurity.   How much do you think it bothers him that Melania pushed his hand away?  Answer:  a lot.  He prides himself on dating and marrying only 10's  and on being in control of the situation. Expect some interesting tweets soon---or more awkward behavior.,0

And the Unions designed PERS.   I was required as a condition of employment as a  State of Oregon to be part of SEIU and pay their dues or money match or I could not even have the job.  Wisconsin recently removed that requirement of Union Membership to have a job.

9630,Martel writes:  "An Ipsos MORI poll estimated that in the 2010 general election  44% of regular(The Independent) readers voted Liberal Democrat  32% voted Labour  and 14% voted Conservative    Sounds a lot like the G&M doesn't it."  -  No  it doesn't.  The G&M has traditionally been a newspaper whose editorial stance leaned to the right  to conservative parties  and  their readership has been a reflection of that.  As is usual with newspapers  the ideology of their editorials  and their readers  reflect each other.  By way of demonstration  The G&M has endorsed the Conservative Party federally in the last four elections.  They have endorsed Liberal Parties federally on occasion  but rarely -  6 times Liberal since WWII vs 17 times for PC/CPC.  So no  The Independent's readership sounds nothing like the G&M's.  Thanks for asking.  Glad to help you out anytime you need to be corrected.  No matter how often.,0

9640,And then there's the real story.  Democrats are against charter schools because every member of every teacher's union is against charter schools. And every teacher's union owns Democratic lawmakers. Teacher's unions are among the largest and best organized and coordinated of any labor union in the U.S.  This is one of those rare times where politicians are not thinking of the children but their own greedy selves.,0
9641,This is a perfect spot for student housing - directly across from Dad's Gate and the core of the UO.  Going vertical is efficient use of the land.  I drive Franklin Blvd every day and have no issues with the Hub and students crossing the street.  Slow down and relax.  The other great benefit from these student high-rise buildings is that they pull student renters out of single-family homes in UO neighborhoods.  Several homes in my block have converted back to owner-occupied recently and I attribute this to the downward pressure put on rents by these high-rise complexes.  This is a very beneficial trend for Eugene.,0

9659,Perhaps the University could have handled this worse  but they would have to had worked really hard to do so.

The sooner he is thrown out of the WH  the sooner this country can truly be great again.,1
9702,No  not all.  Exactly the opposite  capitalism is the best economic system yet created and will probably never be supplanted.  This inherent contradiction is important to recognize in order to fine tune capitalism and prevent violent reaction to it from either the left or right.  I am and always will be a capitalist.  The further we can safely move away from socialism and closer to theoretical capitalism  the better of we all will be in the long run.  But this is a slow and evolutionary process and man could well destroy himself before reaching the end state of a rational and capitalist society.,0

9711,Motivation is a plus whatever one's circumstances. However  what I was addressing was the uneven playing field between the rich and poor. Rules and protections are in place not only to protect the position of the 1% but to also as barriers to interloping 99%ers. Barbers have to be licensed. California only allows the richest dealerships or car repair places to align headlights. Today  I was reading that Robert Mueller's father was class president at Princeton where Robert Mueller attended. Small world  right?  Robert Mueller is by all accounts a war hero and intelligent but many of us live our lives without ever meeting a Princeton graduate although we have known many war heroes and intelligent motivated people although some are beset with family problems  money problems  health problems  and lack of access to educational opportunities. So while I agree that motivation is a plus  being in the 1% opens doors.,0

I do remember past violent  racist  terrorist incidents involving the right wing base such as Timothy McVeigh  Dylan Roof  KKK  or the Nazi's killing millions in their quest for a pure  white  heterosexual society.  Anarachists are not part of left wing or progressive democracy.  Get real.

He said he had nothing to do with Russia  had not been involved with hookers in Russia  and had always assumed he was being recorded when in Russia. He asked what we could do to “lift the cloud.” I responded that we were investigating the matter as quickly as we could  and that there would be great benefit  if we didn’t find anything  to our having done the work well.

9750,Whether or not this was the correct thing to do is a matter of opinion.  What is not a matter of opinion is the 180 degree shift in US foreign policy when compared to little Barry Hussein's limp wristed "Lead from Behind" strategy.  Little Barry and progressives like him do not see the USA as worthy of defense or acknowledge it's role as a world referee when bad guys act out.  Barry's stubborn unwillingness  to name Islam as motivation for world wide terror is but one example.  His empty "Red Line" threat was an invitation to bad guys everywhere. Barry's brain trust (Susan Rice and John Kerry) assured us that the Syrians had gotten rid of chemical weapons.  Well  we know that was one of many lies.  His Iran deal handed untraceable cash to homicidal mullahs and assures that country will go nuclear. Anyone who is old enough will remember a similar set of circumstances when Ronald Reagan had to clean up Jimmy Carter's  foreign policy messes. History repeats itself.,0

9758,Thanks for this. Anyone who thinks for 2 seconds that racism  white supremacy and the oppression of blacks is worse today  or even worsening  needs to grab a mid-19th century history book and read up on Jim Crow and the humiliating & un-American things it did every day to  ten million blacks in the South circa 1948.  Read U.S. Senator Bilbo's "best" quotes  delivered in the Senate or on the stump in Mississippi. Trump's idiot tweeting and clumsy or inadvertent race baiting can't compare to the least bigoted Southern congressmen of that era. It was the Southern Dems in Congress like Bilbo and his ilk who protected Jim Crow from federal spanking for 7 decades while Northern Dems like FDR coddled or ignored Jim Crow's blatant sins to keep the "Solid South's" electoral vote in presidential elections. My 1948 history "30 Days a Black Man" details black lives under America's apartheid in the South.  Rothstein's great "The Color of Law" details how racist govt. policies segregated the North.,1

9763,What a ridiculous goal in o/t. 100% of that goal comes from poor officiating.  Getzlaf blocks the shot  then from inside his own end he fires the puck off the boards.  The pass misses Perry  and goes the length of the ice.  Garden variety icing  right?  Well  the linesmen signal icing  so the Oilers forwards leave the ice on a change  thinking the play is just coming right back  but the linesmen wave it off at the last second  leaving Silfverberg wide open for a one timer.  Given that the first Ducks goal was the goaltender interference judgement call  and the second Ducks goal was clearly offside  but was missed by the linesmen  3 of the 4 Ducks goals had officiating help tonight.  I'm not even an Oilers fan  but that game had me raging.  The NHL should be frankly embarrassed by that display.,0

So too  they at times put the safety of their clients at risk  flying too low  landing in unsafe conditions  and pushing the limits of VFR flight beyond what's legal. They even buzz the cabins of anyone who protests these unsafe practices. I've seen it firsthand. I hope the FAA does something  but am skeptical. According to local lodge owners  80% of the bears have been chased out of two adjacent critical habitat areas by excessive low overflight and intrusion by too many tourists  up to 40 people at a time tramping through the meadows.,0

9792,If we had a free market in drugs  there would be hundreds if not thousands of drug companies. Unfortunately FDA regulations ensure that it cost more than $1 billion and 7 – 10 years to get a new drug through the FDA approval process. If a business doesn’t have $1 billion to put at risk over 7 – 10 years  they can’t enter the market. The FDA has effectively outlawed small startups from the drug market. The big drug companies love the FDA regulations because they don’t have to worry about competition from small innovative startups. Can you imagine how much suffering there would be if there was a $1 billion dollar entry fee to get into other markets? There’d be no HP  Microsoft  Google  Amazon  or Facebook for example.,0
9793,<<I think that he will end up as a nuisance if made an auxiliary bishop somewhere>> Certainly his personal history suggests that you are right. I think any bishop who would accept him in any role would have to be clear with him from the get-go: I can and I will suspend your faculties if you become a problem in this diocese. I think the only way this would work is if Burke were to have a genuine metanoia  a conversion  in which he would seek to serve and not to be served.,0

9797,It is well documented that even before  the ANC came to power they were in negotiations with the arms deal suppliers for their cut. Where did the struggle for the disenfranchised feature in those actions? The ANC described above  in all these comments is not only confined to Mr Zuma's presidency  The arms deal happened under President Mandela's watch. President Mbeki fired adocate Pikoli because he stood up against the corrupt ANC  also the prosess to disband the Scorpions  a highly successful anti-corruption unit  was then started. Under Zuma the Scorpions was then disbanded. Then this very public unashamed display of greed started and this is were we are this moment. It defies logic that such a champion for the disenfranchised could turn into such a monster. It is also undisputed that there were and still are fantastic principled moral leaders in the ANC but they are in a small minority. The fight Makhosi Khoza  a bright and moral person  is in at the moment is really heart wrenching,0

9825,Here in Victoria BC the Holiday has little to do with QE II or QV.   Lets beat Australia to going Republic!  I was one of the mass of Alberta and BC Public School students who got trained in European French in the 1960s bilingualism panic.  They were in a rush to get the French instruction program up and running  so they imported USA text books  film strips and reel to reel tapes intended for teaching European French.   In place teachers who had learned European French in College were assigned as French subject teachers in the middle of a school year.   The result is that when I speak French to a Canadian francophone they often ask me how many years I lived in France.   I work for a Montreal based IT corp which does business around the world. When a local contract was renewed the work was split between Victoria BC and Saguenay. The folks from Saguenay who showed up for 2 weeks seemed pleased with my ability to speak and read French  not upset at all about how I spoke it.,0

We simply need to pray for unity of ourselves with God (a here and now unity: unity of our desires with His desires for us; unity of our will with His will for us  unity of our actions with His commandments  etc.)  and for unity of others with God and us.   The reason there are all sorts of "anxieties" is because we have too much attention on "pluribus" and not enough focus and work on "unum."  Unity with God  naturally brings many fruits  one of which is serenity.   There are some very confused people here  principally because they have matters out of order.,0

9846,Going by the comments so far  I had to double check the heading of the article.   Anyway it's nice to read this “I feel confident in what he’ll do  that’s all I can say to you about that ” Sessions said. “The man has a good reputation. He knows his business.”  The whole thing reads as "being reasonable" which is a nice change considering what else gets bandied about. If he believes Mueller will be doing a good job  he knows that Mueller will look at everything.  The "...come to an end sooner rather than later." is probably for Trump's benefit. LOL,0

9860,My thoughts with the friends and Family of the victim.  This area has been a growing concern for traffic  bicyclist and pedestrian safety.    In my opinion  as a former member of the HBL  with the introduction of the cycle track it has become a challenge to navigate and maintain optimal visual monitoring of vehicles  bicyclists and pedestrians as you drive along  egress and regress from parking stalls and adjacent drive ways along S. King (i.e. Kaiser Clinic).  While not a perfect solution  perhaps the City can consider making improvements and utilize Young Street  as an alternative route.   Just saying... :),0
9861,More of the hidden agendas of the Conservative/Tory government as they destroyed the government services while aiding and abetting the looting of the economy.

Making the marquee programs all about the petty politics of FBX and JNU is counterproductive and will make recruiting top academics much more difficult.   We need to move on to the big leagues.  "Fairbanks first" would be fine for a vocational school or community college  not a world class university.,0

9866,I am quite aware of the problems facing primary and secondary education in our nation as a whole.  I am also aware of the movement to radicalize the teaching profession dating back to the reign of Albert Shanker  whose incendiary tactics merited an ironic reference to Mutually Assured Destruction in Woody Allen's "Bananas". . The picture accompanying this article graphically illustrates the problem with American educational locally and nationally. The teacher's unions are utilizing blue collar tactics to achieve their ends in what once was a white collar profession.  As a result teaching is no longer a calling but a job  attracting mainly those whose degree has little economic value  but when paired with a teaching certificate can insure a union protected paycheck. . The problem is exacerbated by the refusal of teacher's unions to admit that their members are part of the problem.  When confronted with abysmal performance blame is laid on the students race  poverty and environment.,0

9901,I know you're either current or former LE so I am curious as to why you advocate for "must inform".  I know it seems like common sense to what to tell an officer especially if you mean no harm but I changed my tune when a DPD lieutenant explained his thoughts.  His came down to he already assumes everyone is armed and wants to kill him so you announcing you have a gun only stands to escalate an already tense situation.  It's one thing for a driver to say "I have a gun inside my right hip waistband" to the officer standing at his window but what does the rookie officer approaching on the passenger side hear?  The whole conversation or just the words "I have a gun"?  I can see both sides so truly just interested in your perspective especially as LE.  I also agree that all CCW classes should invite an officer to speak on this subject  mine did and it was great to be able to ask questions of him.,0

9906,What an 'ugly biased' column. Obviously our unethical French-Canadian Miss seems to feel that her "idealization & devaluation" neurotic premise in describing "The English" is acceptable; especially when describing.. "Portraits of stoic Brits during the Blitz are adorably misleading. Honest accounts of the time reveal a population blind-drunk and irretrievably slutty. A far cry from the image we’ve been sold.."  ??"adorably misleading"??  ??"blind-drunk & irretrievable slutty"??  Ms. Cormier appears to enjoy deprecating "The English"& their tragic histories.   Cormier's column seems primarily about putting-down 'The English' only to then kindof 'suck up' with glorification of our salty French-Canadian's Life in London.  Do take note: There are many Canadians who had Mothers  Fathers  Grandparents & extended Family die during the German campaign to bomb the livinghell out of "The English".  Hitler enjoyed his little laugh only temporarily though.. Eh  mademoiselle?  Btw: What crap  G&M..,1

Without the new blood (aka new home buyers) coming into the market the people selling their 'starter' homes have no one to sell to and therefore move up to the next level of home purchase.   This is repeated again at the next level of pricing and so on. Without the fresh people at the bottom the whole thing is going to collapse!  Watch for it....,0

Hold on there. . The Harper government  the darling of the F.I.  elevated squandering on snowmobile clubs and small-town baseball diamonds (let alone gazebos) to an art form. By contrast  "green" spending has huge positive externalities. .

Perhaps some sort of decent bonus built into the equation might be a solution? We just might have to settle for training them up and letting them move along.

9935,Lovely story. Wife and I are in exactly the same position with our cottage on the shores of lake Huron. I had a spinal decompression and fusion 4 years ago and am on the waiting list for a hip replacement. Athelene just had a knee replacement 4 weeks ago. Our three children all have busy lives in different cities and are visiting the cottage less and less. Even the grandchildren  growing into teenage years  are so busy in the summer that it is difficult for them to find time to visit.  Maintenance is slowly falling behind and the cedar hedge there is tall and wide enough that I almost need a helicopter to trim it.  But we keep putting off the decision. Everything really depends on the results of the surgery. If we recover enough to keep up with the maintenance we will probably keep it a few more years. If not  we will sell. I agree with the author that the cottage means a great more to us than to the children. But one weekend with the grandchildren is enough to change our minds.,0

9942,No you are wrong. MOST politicians are not heros of the Republic. But some like Barack Obama ARE heros and worthy of our collective appreciation. Trump will not be remembered as a hero to America because Trump is a narcissistic self absorbed pig. While Obama with his character proved his commitment and dedication to our county without scandal because Barack Obama is not a pig. Jefferson Lincoln Washington and Obama are birthdays worth remembering. Just as Trump is equally worth reviling because of his lack of character.,1

9947,I agree we should all be "warriors" for free speech and that anyone  including Ms. Khan  should be able to express views including those we might consider to be nonsense. But the right to free speech must cover all including those who some may think "privileged" due to their colour and/or economic position. Based on recent events at Canadian universities where speakers have been shouted down or had speeches cancelled  this is often not the case. If you disagree with or feel offended by another's view  use your own right to speak rather than suppression. The latter implies that speech is free only if you agree with it.,0

9975,But RB  salaries in every sector in Alberta are inflated relative to the rest of the country  in part because they have to compete with the high wages paid in the oil sector  even for unskilled labour.

The province's private sector has also benefitted from the Notley government's spending on roads and other infrastructure (just like it did from the federal Economic Action Plan spending earlier) -- just who do you think got those contracts?

10003,So  an individual who has never served in the military in any capacity and who uses his father's service as a means to be offended is  trying to call out an individual who actually served.  Despite an individuals actual MOS they may have served in any capacity as each soldier is combat trained. I know of a few soldiers I served with in Iraq  who were just "personnel clerks" as you so put it  who routinely went on convoys from FOB to FOB. They therefore saw routine combat action as convoys were routinely attacked.   As a combat veteran myself  I agree one should not make up false statements about military service for personal gain   especially political gain  but you have given no true evidence of such happening. Maybe if you had served a single day instead of riding on daddy's coat tales you'd understand how the military works and be better informed next time your try to inform others on a military related topic.,0

"Gender science" is frequently said to be in its infancy yet so called progressive are rushing to form legislation based on a pre-conceived conclusion to that field of study that makes illegal any questioning of that pre-conceived conclusion.

10016,Decades of deficits you say  not exactly the sunny days we were promised is it. The Liberals came in on a promise of running a small deficit  but that is now long gone  and now it will be decades of debt  which means we are probably in worse shape then people realize or are told. On the bright side it will be amusing to see how the usual Liberal cheerleaders  manage to blame Harper for something that hasn't even happened yet  while spinning it into something good that the Liberals are doing. Let me guess they are being open and transparent  but I guess the other part of the mantra of growing the middle class may be on hold. If you are old  you should have known better by voting Liberal  if you are young  you have now learned a lesson  which you will pay for until you are old,0
10017,The PFD program over time evolved into a contract between Alaskans and those who held elected office.

Well Governor you have  for reasons that you could explain until the "second coming"  and that could be totally valid  have now violated that contract.    I appreciate that this veto was a hard decision I also realize that it is a decision you will face each year until the Legislature accepts the reality of today's Alaska and evolves into a more effective organization with the ability and courage to be responsible stewards of our fiscal assets and to conduct the people's business out from behind the closed caucus door in an open forum of debate.    Finally   I hope that the entire Alaska State Government will finally appreciate that the windfall of  TAPS is not going to repeat itself and that we need to stop betting on "the next big strike".,0

10024,The same Globe that endorsed Stephen Harper?  I guess you think it's pretty clever to say "they run and hide when a war breaks out"..you can thank Jean Chretien for deciding that the Iraq war didn't pass the smell test.  If you recall  Harper was quite keen to blindly put Canada's military in peril for non existent weapons of mass destruction.,0

Billy constantly says he's been in the bush for the past 30 years and after more research I've discovered that's so far from the truth. I've stopped watching and have switched to the Last Alaskans. That's the real deal and now that I've seen it I've been spotting even more inconsistencies with the Bush family lifestyle or at least the lifestyle they portrayed. Again....truly disappointed they are just thieves and not the hard working people they claimed.,0

10043,Mctruck  the intelligence heads testifying yesterday may have said “they could not comment on an on-going investigation " but former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told MSNBC'S Andrea Mitchell on Friday that there could be evidence of collusion between Russia and President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign  COULD BE.  He said "There was no evidence that rose to that level  at that time  that found its way in to the intelligence community assessment  which we had pretty high confidence in."  He added "That's not to say there wasn't evidence  but not that met that threshold."  In testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on March 8th  Clapper also said he was unaware of any evidence to support the allegations.  Senator Dianne Feinstein (D.  Calif.)  a member of the Select Committee on Intelligence  told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on March 4th that there is so far no evidence showing collusion between Donald Trump's campaign aides and Russian officials.,0

10051,Very well put in brief terms  Senator Halford. The real monsters we must face are the results of SB21 -which cost Ak $2Billion/yr from the get-go - & ineffective ETHICS RULES in the Legislature. We should not acquiesce to the threats of losing the PFD if we do not sacrifice half of it now  as stated by this administration.  We must demand that equitable taxation of BigOil & other resource extraction  as well as an equitable Income Tax  a Sales Tax .... & a massive reduction in the size of state government & services. This administration & the past several Legislatures have avoided this significant  difficult work of restoring Ak government to something close to what the framers of the Constitution envisioned.,0

No one expects that tho'.  What Trump told Billy Bush was not a conversation between intimate friends. Bush said he went along to get along with "the star " and regretted it. Trump is a pig.  Character is what you say & do when you think no one's listening or watching. Trump is smarmy even when he thinks people are watching or listening. He encourages his followers to attack protesters  saying he'll pay their legal bills. Violence ensues. Big surprise. You're backing a modern Mussolini. Perhaps you'll be able to spend time hanging out together  like Benito and his mistress did at the end of WW2.,1

10063,What a waste of time.   The Paris accords is all part of the globalist agenda to sell carbon credits and push the false global warming scheme now called climate change since global warming has not been occurring.  The  goal is to reduce the quality of life for the West to third world while elevating the third world countries to be on par with the new reduced quality of life for the West.  The ultimate goal is global control by the One World Order fanatics. Unfortunately  our political ruling elite have all signed up to promote this agenda.  Most are "useful idiots" wanting to jump on the train for their own selfish interests.,1

10067,The author makes a good case for being patient with rate increase decisions. There is much more risk involved in raising them too fast than too slow.  People generally believe that rates are going to be rising. That knowledge alone is helpful.  Raising them too fast could easily cause economic problems that we do not want.,0
10068,Do I really need to point out to you the difference between illegal and unethical?  If that doesn't work  how about the difference between illegal and stupid?  Not all that is unethical is illegal  nor should it be.  Same goes for stupidity.  Because  like it or not  under the rules we have in place  Rachel Notley is the rightfully elected Premier of Alberta and she has done nothing for which she should be in prison.  This makes the actions of these chanters both unethical and stupid.  But not illegal.  Next  do I need to point out that free speech is a two way street?  Free speech does mean these chanters get to say what they want without criticism  the protesters have the right to start such a chant and we have the right to call them unethical and stupid.  Especially heavy on the stupid.  Same goes for your comment.  Welcome to the world of bidirectional free speech.  You dish out free speech and you get it back.,1

10077,To hear the city tell it  the citizens of Eugene have acknowledged the choice between growing the city vertically and growing it out in area  SoCal style. Apparently  a majority of us would prefer to not live in a SoCal-style region with cars and exhaust everywhere and most of the space dedicated to those cars. If so  then we acknowledge that many/most of the suburban-style single-family homes will eventually be replaced with taller buildings and that we will revamp our transportation system to offer fewer amenities  like free parking  to cars.   The city is correct that the citizens want to grow up and that sentiment was  until very recently  driven largely by the folks on the south side. It's funny to me how they support densification as long as it happens elsewhere and doesn't affect them in any way. Clearly  this city needs to grow up in more ways than one.,0

10081,You cherry pick selective cases without a full analysis. Shame seems to be in short supply of people trying to win at all costs these days. People like this writer willing to bash scientists and economists who are just doing their best job to gauge truth should feel this just massive sense of shame.  If there's anything less patriotic than unfairly undermining our institutions for political gain I don't know what it is.   Here's some real facts about the CBO and ACA:  1. CBO predicted that with ACA the # of uninsured would drop to 30 million by 2016  almost exactly right. 2. If you compare the prognostications about the economic impacts from all major think tanks and all Republicans ever who (were screaming about the inevitable 'death panels')  CBO comes out the best.  Facts are stubborn things. Is winning so important to you that you'll lie about the CBO rather than realize that your own policy beliefs might be wrong in this one case?,0

10095,Roma = gypsies.  For those of us who have lived in Europe and experienced first hand the lifestyle of the gypsies...the begging and stealing...understand why they are being deported.   At Allen Gardens in Toronto  on 2 separate occasions  I watched an older man sitting with a young boy  as if waiting. It was a school day  the boy was not in school. I got up to leave with my elderly mom. As we exited the building  the young boy quickly got up and followed us out. I turned around to look at him  he veered away. It looked like he was after my moms purse  but upon seeing me watching him  changed his mind.  I knew they were Roma.,0

"  Ummm  Boeing could reframe the conversation very quickly by withdrawing its trade complaint. Anything else will just be spin.   I find this whole thing very offensive  unless of course Boeing is just doing this to ensure that Canada never gives up the trade dispute resolution provisions of NAFTA  in which case they will surely achieve their goal.,0

10101,To have the cake and eat it  too.,0
10102,I can understand why you react to the high staffing ratio. I had the same reaction when I first started working with staff at OSH in Salem. Then I discovered a major reason why these ratios are so high. Because of federal rules (which come with funding) and lawsuits by the feds against hospitals around the country  the use of physical restraints and isolation are essentially not an option when dealing with these dangerous parients. Without these tools  the only way to move people around for treatment  recreation etc. is through the use of staff moving with the person. The more violence prone  the more staff that need to be physically present with the person at all times to maintain control and prevent injury to anyone  patients or staff. When you multiply this sort of staffing over 2-3 shifts  you do indeed get a pretty big number. This is not a kindergarden playground environment.,0
10103,Canada badly needs to significantly strengthen its presence  trade and economic ties with Europe and Asia for many reasons. Among the most important are: uncertainties associated with the unfolding structural changes in the world economy  the web of cross border and cross continent channels  and the relations that support them. Designating a seasoned and highly reputable Canadian statesman like Mr. Dion  who with his sharp analytic mind  has observed the birth of the EU and its earlier incarnations from inside Europe to serve as Canada's ambassador in Brussels is a landmark development for our country.  This nomination happens at a time when shortsighted political motives are at work to weaken the unity and the weight of the EU  an extraordinary achievement in 'continental' governance. The EU leaders should be heartened to have a cerebral and seasoned politician like Mr. Dion working with them to promote interests and values shared by both sides.,0

Well  let's just analyze your nonsense.  First  you should preface your posts to tell everyone that you're just restating what you heard on Fox News this evening.  I think you believe it makes you look smart  or you don't think we'll recognize it for what it is.  What we know about idiot Magaphant lapdogs like you is that you are incapable of original thought or analysis  so you blindly repeat what you heard on Fox News.  Now Rth  please try at least once to show us that you're capable of being something other than a Fox and Trump lapdog.  But most of all  keep posting  you are clearly almost as big an idiot as Sarge and Pocho now.  Keep it up.,1

10110,Probably not. But if that rate cut is the hurdle between hiring more employees and expanding production  why wouldn't a company do that?  Also  it's highly unlikely that you don't know that customers pay any tax liability a business incurs  to the extent a consumer price increase will be tolerated in the market. But you knew that.,0

10113,While you make some good points  the remark regarding online virtual financial services having more risk is usually totally incorrect. Tangerine is a branch of the Bank of Nova Scotia and thus is an extremely low risk. Other online virtual financial services are owned by successful Credit Unions and insurance companies. All have some kind of deposit insurance coverage. Therefore you really need to know which firm you are really dealing with.,0

The unnamed president is at the forefront of a machine that spews its brainwashing propaganda to millions of followers on a channel owned by an Australian.

10119,Have a 2006 Sienna  been a great vehicle  can't beat either Toyota or Honda for reliability. We've taken it all over the rockies on so many hiking/camping trips I can't remember. Lots of power in these minivans. Also tons of space (for all your hiking gear). Although they may not look great  you cannot  and I stress this  cannot beat them for functionality. This is super important with kids (ie easy to comfortably fit 4 kids plus two adults plus lots of storage for hockey bags etc etc).   Although our Sienna has over 220k  the kids (now 17 and 16) love taking it out with their friends -- because it can fit 5 or 6 people comfortably (may not be the coolest vehicle  but once again can't beat the functionality).,0
10120,A good decision by Rep. LeDoux to shut it her PAC down. Hopefully it will stay that way.   Common sense dictates that if a legislator can't accept money from lobbyists who reside outside the legislator's district  the legislator shouldn't be allowed to start or otherwise be part of an effort to raise money from lobbyists and contribute it to legislators who do not represent those lobbyists.,0

10136,A complaint that some of them made before the racism issue was that Trump was not listening to them  and using the councils as window dressing and to get them to praise and thank him. Before this  they disagreed with him on the Paris Accord  NAFTA  the TPP  and his position on coal  and his immigration policies. Outside the council  some disagreed with his position on Obamacare. Trump did not engage with them on these issues  but simply ignored them.,0

10144,Actually  about 30 years ago  give or take  that changed. Rape suspects used a defense that was difficult to overcome. That being more than the word of the victim. The result was to reduce the standard of evidence to make convictions more likely. IMO it was a necessary move  but over time the pendulum has swung to far. To begin the punishment phase prior to the conviction is beyond wrong. Especially for an outfit outside the legal circle.,0
10145,It's pompous and egalitarian to say that no one should be out in the "wee morning hours".  Many people work service jobs until late at night.  And many of these people don't have vehicles.

I just happen to be of the opinion that the Caps beat them because they're the best team in the league.

10154,The programme is based on People Soft from Oracle. To those at large institutions who have suffered through the implementation of People Soft  the federal government's problems will come as no surprise  including some in the former Prime Minister's own province  such as at the University of Alberta. Part of the problem is that adoption decisions are made by bureaucratic suits with little input from people with an understanding of the complexity of the software and the problems of implementation  or knowledge of the problems encountered elsewhere  and thus by people prone to unrealistic expectations   Another is the steep learning curve for those office workers who have to use the system. Extensive training won't completely solve the latter problem. Only experience will. If it is any consolation to government workers  the problems with the system eventually will be overcome.,0

The problems in the Middle East have existed since before Sumer and will eventually be solved by its inhabitants to the dissatisfaction of most who think they know better.,1
10160,too many income transactions not reported. In our best interest that sales tax rise and income tax fall. Professionals and others have incorporated and combine use of trusts to minimize personal tax. This should stop; but top personal rates should also be reduced.,0

10167,There are many who idiotically point to Bill Clinton.  First  do not try to excuse Trump’s bad behavior with Clinton’s behavior  that is what children do.  I was not a fan of Bill Clinton and I am not a democrat. Bill Clinton received deferments just like Trump did. Bill Clinton was eligible for the draft in 1969. Trump was never eligible.  Trump is a draft dodging coward.  Clinton was a draft eligible weasel.  Big difference.  Why not bring up Hillary?  Hillary killed people so it would be okay if Trump was a rapist  right?,1

10170,Nice to see a company having a little marketing fun.   The Demon is a one-trick pony while only being in the same league as the infinitely more accomplished Tesla.   I get the rolling thunder fun this car represents to some but in the real world  it's one talent is useless.  The acceleration of the Tesla is a sidebar  where as for the Demon  it is the Holy Grail and the only reason for its existence.  You can buy a Tesla for the same money and the world would be a better place if Chrysler had devoted the funds to making an advanced Tesla challenger rather than this lots-of-fun-once anachronism.

10182,The USDA  which administers the SNAP food stamp program just released a report that stated that $8.5 billion of their "charity" is spent on soda pop. That is 10% of the entire contributions to the hungry in this program. It is the single largest purchase using taxpayer dollars contributed to the program.  True and meaningful charity would help those in need learn how to make their dollars go farther--buy what is on sale  cook what is in season  and prepare meals from scratch. That is how my husband and I live our life. But instead  taxpayer dollars are effectively subsidizing the soda pop industry.  Please take your blinders off. God doesn't want our tax dollars to feed the diabetes and obesity epidemics.,0

10198,The middle East certainly has seen it conflict before the European arrival. It also had seen long times of stability like under the Ottoman empire. In any case their conflicts pale when compared to what happened during that period on European soil. Furthermore let's not forget that our interventions have a long history. Think about the crusades and you get he idea. I personally think if we had stopped intervening on behalf of our western stooges they would have solved their problems a long time ago.  Sure there would have been human suffering along with it but not a suffering without end like i is right now.,0

It needs to be fixed asap so we can enjoy more of those experiences like the one you had.

And there is never a shortage in those areas.,0
10204,anybody notice the coincidences between a trump trip to russia and then a big hot mess  involving russia  a week after the trump returns to US. Putin is playing games  with trump & our whole nation. he is a puppet master ...he has dirt over trump - no doubt. he asks an impossible thing of trump  trump must say no and putin jerks his/our strings and gives donald fits. don jr & that email.. just stupid. our fate in those tiny hands  the last time   it was about the leaks...he is just jacking us around watching us disintegrate. who's winning the cold war? OMG you can't have but one answer. our gov't has done virtually nothing  NOTHING  since trump.   his legacy  for what that's going to be worth  is that he was at the helm and the main cause for our great democracy to crumble.   we have so many real problems and he just wants to pillage and pillage and pillage us. and so many people are OK with it! are they brain dead? if you're not nervous about our future - you're not paying attention.,1

It appears in Jean-Jacques Rousseau's Confessions  his autobiography (whose first six books were written in 1765  when Marie Antoinette was nine years of age  and published in 1782). The context of Rousseau's account was his desire to have some bread to accompany some wine he had stolen; however  feeling he was too elegantly dressed to go into an ordinary bakery  he recollected the words of a 'great princess'.

10236,I've never understood the Republican platform on this. People (including Democrats AND Republicans) aren't going to stop having sex. It just isn't going to happen  regardless of the weird Puritanical fantasies some pro-lifers have. So why not help prevent abortions through contraception? It's not the entire answer but it's a part of the answer. But Republicans  supposedly pro-life (which is laughable) want to eliminate one method that helps prevent abortions.

10264,You know Cladwall and the rest will cancel the A Express bus and FORCE West Oahu mass transit commuters into a feeder bus/train/bus transit solution that will DOUBLE their one way commute times.  Hoopili station is a bottleneck and many thousands of W Oahu commuters will have to all wait to ride feeder buses or fight to find parking to park and ride to the station and they all have to simultaneously queue up to board a single train at a time.  Also for safety each train has to be spaced far enough apart and that would be about when the train in front reaches the next station which is one mile away.  Since most W Oahu commuters either work or go to school at UH or all of the neighboring private schools in the Makiki/Manoa area or work in Waikiki  the feeder buses to these locations will be simularly overtaxed as well AND be caught in rush hour traffic like all other commuters who use their personal vehicles.

10289,CR>  You are absurd and ridiculous in all of your vile assumptions.  You know nothing and will know nothing  as usual.  Own up?????,1
10290,This literally happened on the TV. Tucker Carlson: "The counties who voted for you will do far worse under your plan" Donald Trump: "Oh  I know…"  Praise Jeebus.    Trump was 'raised up' to rule over the 'winners'.,0
10291, And they're very big monstrous creatures in the movie,0
10292,Yes  lets put political correctness aside and call a spade a spade: Donald Trump is a senile  racist moron  without the slightest sense of decency. Time to stop excusing his ignorant rants and admit that he's completely unfit for office.,1
10293,The removal of the pontifical secret and imposing mandatory reporting to the civil authorities will not be retrospective. It will not bring to light any incriminating documents. Any such documents that have come to light only did so because of subpoenas and search warrants issued by civil authorities. That can still happen irrespective of any change to canon law. Any opposition will come from clericalism  which regards clergy as special people who should be protected from the criminal laws of States  and this has occurred through secrecy. Despite Francis’ condemnation of clericalism  his refusal to agree to the demands of two United Nations Committees to impose mandatory reporting points to his being just as affected by it. In his 2012 book with Rabbi Skorka  he describes how he advised a bishop to remove the faculties of an abuser priest and to put him on a canonical trial. There was no mention of the matter being reported to the police.,0
10294,And Think Progress and Media Matter don't pull the same crap? I try and fact check what I read and again with the links THIS ARTICLE seems legit.

10323,You can cross reference these sources with any search engine you choose. You're critical of the sources yet produce nothing to refute other then your words.

10324,There is already a multi lane overpass and I doubt if two more overpasses at the same location are going to enable the security guards at the Muldoon Gate to be able to process vehicles faster.  Look at the VA parking lot. That amount of vehicles does not justify this elaborate project.    The reason for this is easier access to the Tikahtnu Mall . A city official told me they will not be paying for any of this project.  I would like that information verified and also receive an explanation of how they were able to build and not have to provide vehicle access to their property before the mall opended.  We could have better spent this $41 million.,0
10325,When you live in the patch  bad water and bad air​ is a fact of life. Above any commercially viable hydrocarbon reservoir are shallower ones that gradually leak out. In the Permian basin  for example  there are water wells that were drilled over 100 years ago  before any oil well had been drilled in Texas  and the water had enough methane in it to be flammable.  The town of Sweetwater  Texas got its name from being the 1st good water found near the Permian basin.,0

It's all they know anymore to try to keep power  which has become all that some of them care about. The enemies' lists were started before Trump won  and everyone agrees that everything is all about him and paying back anyone who challenges him. He even said that himself about himself.,0
10339,What you conveniently fail to mention is that fighting for "states and individual rights" meant fighting for white men's right to treat blacks as property  not persons  with the rights to abuse  maim  torture  rape  and kill the blacks as they pleased.

All you did was call for new laws and restrictions but didn't once mention the need for the existing laws to be enforced.  There is a greater chance that Texas would have been avoided had the laws been followed.  Your suggested new laws provide no such assurances and yet you push for them before pushing for current laws already in place.  Why is that?,0
10357,These were not crimes committed inside the prisons  they were all committed against people OUTSIDE of the prisons walls by inmates serving life sentences/or on death row - held in solitary confinement .  This proves that the state does not have "the ability" the Church claims/assumes it has.    The Church is mistaken  and She doesn't care.  I know that for a fact the U.S. bishops don't care about what this "three-year  $5 million  local  state and federal investigation" proved which took place in Santa Rosa  CA at Pelican Bay State Prison and published in the newspaper some 6 years after the Church changed Her historical position on capital punishment.,0

10359,Well  one thing is for sure.... Comey won't have a job come January.  Trump will pick his own if he wins  and I guarantee Obama is straining at the bit to fire his ass.  Problem for Obama is he can't because that would look so terrible  even though Comey is guilty of extraordinarily bad judgment here.  Won't that be something if Clinton wins?  She'll certainly replace him  while he's heading up an investigation of her.  And she'd be completely within her rights to do so as the President-elect.  I find this extremely humorous.  Comey was trying to avoid screwing himself by releasing the statement to Congress.  And in doing so...... he screwed himself.,1
10360,Ha! You must be joking. Not all 'old style politicians' were shameless drunks  crackheads  cheats and liars. Ford excelled at those traits (and little else).  Oh yeah  you're the guy with the crush on Trump. That explains your affection for scumbag politicians.,1

The rolling foothills are now denuded and replanted with hyper growth doug fir planted in corn rows. Without genetic diversity  a disease could wipe out millions of acres of tree farms and leave dead  diseased trees to burn or rot. And BTW  Weyco is no longer "The Tree Growing Company". They are a real estate trust and poised to develop their lands into 20 and 40 acre home sites  putting more rural homes adjacent to tree farms and increasing the risk of another human caused wildfire. It's stupidity based on greed and nothing else. When you enjoy a glass of water  thank the chemical industry for the additional flavors of 2 4d  and a palette of herbicides designed to kill. It's an unsustainable practice that will come back to haunt us.,1

Educated and clear thinking people know Trump is an imbecile but their is a sizable portion of the public that have now been outed for being part of his ilk.   We are trying to figure out how to treat them.....do we make fun of them for being stupid?  That is not nice  but frustration pushes many in that direction of belittling them....do we treat them with kindness when they are filled with hate and poor logic.... just what is the answer..... they do not deal with facts...complex problems are simplified to the point of irrelevancy.....it is tough dealing with angry dummies.,1
10377,Spen - look at this guy's name. LEO can't win either way. People bitch that LEO killed a minority. People bitch that LEO didn't kill the guy because of his record and who he was.  This guy is a minority - so then they would be blamed for killing a Mexican when they probably wouldn't have killed a white guy.... LEO in Alaska has phenomenal shooting skills. Our officers don't accidently shoot bystanders  they shoot based on race causing mass riots and most often then not they don't kill the perps. If APD shot every criminal to attempted to apprehend Anchorage would flip their shit! Personally  I would like to see APD have a higher kill rate and end these lowlife's criminal careers.,0

10391,Exactly!  And of course that money was saved up by ACES  and clearly tax policy is what needs to be fixed to stop our budget 'crisis'.  It's almost as if they created this 'crisis' as an excuse to get into the Permanent Fund to give it to their Conoco employers who have always resented paying taxes and want their money back.   Government has always wanted to use the fund.  The PFD was created as a wake up call to this theft.    Wake up Alaskans!  Hammond was preparing us for this very moment.  Time for us to show courage and stand up to these charlatans.  If they cannot write tax policy to get revenue from our oil- They FAILED!    Oil revenue is where they get money for government spending-they need to figure out how to raise revenue  not take it from earnings on our savings.

10397,We will have to disagree  Frank. Just because an organization calls itself "FactCheck" doesn't mean that everything that they publish is a fact. I couldn't care less what Carly Fiorina and Fox News state either. The fact of the matter is that regardless of how the Clinton Foundation attempts to obscure the truth under phrases like "charitable work performed in house"  they still gave a mere 6% to charitable organizations in 2014;  http://thefederalist.com/2016/09/16/clinton-foundation-spent-6-percent-charitable-grants-2014/,0

Again  how could it be controversial to study how the government can reduce or eliminate such negative influences in society?,0

10410,Thanks for clarification about the projects. I will reiterate you can't buy patriotism  it's a lifestyle choice. Regarding DoD payments to the NFL  I noticed anytime the Government pays for anything  its always politics; whether to influence policymaking or to push a personal agenda that may compromise an individual's core values. After review of the evidence presented  it's a similar stunt like any other Federally-funded program except any Government that uses public resources to push a personal agenda and force an individual to compromise their values and lifestyle choice it describes coercion. Anytime the Government pays  someone will have to compensate for it. Affordable housing wouldn't exist without a broke economy. When comes to the Governmental grants the people are last while the people have to make sacrifices in order to keep up the pace of governmental policymaking.,0

A huge percentage of these articles are written by people whom have little to zero experience in RE  so it shocks me that you are so upset when they turn out to be void of any substance.  One thing I believe right now is this: Canada is one of the safest places in the world to live and people want to live here.......most of them are multigenerational families with deep pockets. They want there kids to go to school here.......inquire about enrollment in the private school sector......they are experiencing unprecedented enrollment  Downturn..yes....longterm....no,0

10420,Respectfully NIGHT OWL  I always admired Mr. Tillman of the Arizona Cardinals. He gave up millions in NFL money and luxuries  and went to serve his country  and paid the ultimate price. That was a true sacrifice  one that put his nation and it's honor above himself  and all the money the NFL could give him. A real American  one who truly loved his country  with all it's ills and flaws  and all it's glory and greatness!   Think Mr. Marshall and the others kneeling could boycott the NFL and walk away for what they believe in and are kneeling for? No  they kneel and get paid  the NFL agrees with their action to keep the money flowing  even those they are losing many along the way who believe in America. It's pretty superficial in my opinion.,0

10422,Sorry my tablet has a mind of its own at times.  Please overlook NOVEMBER.,0
10423,We already have a detailed report which  implemented  would save $25 billion per year on a department which comprises more than 1/6 of the whole budget. Lets start with that.,0
10424,It's political censoring that's really over the top  some call it PC. For instance  Steve Martin couldn't even call his friend Carrie Fisher beautiful in a tweet about her death without the PC nuts shaming him into taking it down. The only reason for censoring a post on this site is supposed to be because it's "uncivil" not because the majority that camp out here don't like it. That's ridiculous!,1
10425,Not that I would want to take away anyone's benefit package  but it does seem increasingly untenable that public employees (in general) have better benefits than any but the highest compensated private employees.   As middle class benefits have shrunk  government has generally increased them. Having a wide disparity between public and private employement is an eventual recipe for disaster. Especially when tax increases are sought.,0

10430,Where  is  the  proof of Russian hacking.   If it was he case that means Assange is working for the Russans and I doubt that.     Its    amazing and worrying  that the Western press would get so hysterical  on this matter.  US and other western countries are probably hacking Russia and other friends and enemies right now.    .,0
10431,Several cabins also on the road system en route to Chena Hot Springs along with the cabins at Salcha River  Birch and Quartz Lake. Usually the campground hosts occupy the latter 2 in the summe  all here in the Interior. Those are all quite popular  so reserve early.   You must also now bring your own firewood  as all the partyers have used up what has been meant for heating the cabins for their bonfires instead.  When we were in Cordova hiking  almost everyone we saw had some form of firearm; the bear presence out there is considerable. A visit to the local fish and game office before you head out will help you understand the local bear behavior. They are way more active down on the coast  compared to the Interior.,0
10432,Great background  Stephen. Scurvy is paying back  as usual  the Zuma/PIC gift of the not-Independent Group.  While back in Zumaland  while all this filthy smearing is going on  Gibberjabba is firing honest people from the Treasury and capture continues.,0
10433,God doesn't want us to over-complicate our approach to Him.  He told us to come to Him as little children. This doesn't mean we shouldn't full use the intellect He gave us - He gave it to us so that we could come closer to Him  not to wax on about esoterica  pretending  etc.   That nothing can be the effect of an infinite causal chain is sufficient for me to conclude that there is a God  and that there's no need to have more than one of them  otherwise it begs a lot of questions....do they differ  then they aren't infinite in their attributes  etc. etc. etc.   "Evolution as tenet" is sort of a simplistic answer  but it actually puts one into the same position of having to search for the uncaused cause.  That something can't be the effect of an infinite causal chain forces me to conclude that there was a first cause  which itself existed outside of time.   I find it odd that this first cause wouldn't also be a Person  in fact the most perfect of persons....vs  simply being a "force".,0
10434,Sounds like your windows may fog up with that feeble heat source.  Could be a safety issue.,0
10435,The Chump is a loser. Everything he touches turns to s--t. Multiple bankruptcies and refusing to compensate people who did work for him. He attracts bigots and racists like flies to kukae. Whatever wealth he claims to have is from laundering dirty money.,1

10437,Don Da! Con courted his voters like the wife abuser that he is. He promised them what ever they needed to hear in order to "seal the deal" The honeymoon isn't even over and the soft deceiving caress has been replaced by his bitch slapping tiny hands. Trump supporters will need to put some ice on that,1

10442,just one more of trump's decisions gone south. his ego is so huge and infantile  he  must be livid - it is surprising he hasn't had a stroke or heart attack... sincerely.  he's overweight  70 yrs old  a very driven personality. that kind of pressure blows when it blows. apparently  by many  many accounts  he just rages around in the white house. like the world's most spoiled brat. i can't imagine his rage about this  his best plan ever.    and he must be figuring out by now that the US is not a monarchy  and he did not get crowned for life.   we have a system that is based on checks and balances. he's tried   and still works at throwing out as much garbage out there every day to try to obscure real issues.  our government   with his ineptness at the  helm   is got him in a stalemate - i hope - so far   he's tried to strong arm it  sneak around it  lie to it  and stonewall it. and the USA democracy still stands in spite of him. hope i can say that in a year from now.,0

10454,I thought that Austen Ivereigh's analysis was quite good and it was telling that Burke's fingers were all over this and that he was the one who was urging Festing to overreact.  I am glad that Pope Francis has been blessed with such a bumbling fool as his main opponent.,1
10455,It's going to take someone to die before they modify safe third. Stupid and senseless.,1
10456,I have a question.  The Guardian article on this topic stated that a close friend of Julian Assange believed that the DNC leaks were 'an inside job'.  He said he had actually met the hacker who had turned over the DNC e-mails.  Is anyone following up on a potential lead?  I'm not saying it's true or that Russian hacking did not happen.  Just that I'd like to see a thorough investigation that covers all potential angles.,0

10468,Like whiskey  you've drunk from the 100 proof FEAR bottle.,0
10469,What should have made the article is the 50% or more price increase on cable.  When my 2 year contract is up in November my monthly bill goes from $85 per month to $155 per month  a 82% price increase.  The $155 per month does not include movie channels.  GCI is starting to lose thousands of cable customers as people realize the price increases.,0

10475,I suppose the Donald would prefer that Mexicans turn to alternative means of income rather than an honest and reliable job in automotive assembly. That might entail  for some of them  turning to less desirable income means that might be detrimental to the health and security of Americans.,0
10476,Of course not.  I'm just suggesting that there are times when lies are appropriate.  There are no absolutes.  Seriously.  Specifically  what "lies" have Pence and Sarah Huckabee told?  Were any of them as egrieous as the the lies Obama told to get public acceptance of ObamaCare?  The GOP doesn't have a monopoly on "the end justifies the means."  The Democrats consider it SOP.,0

10478,what is with the &amp thing?,0
10479,You are PATHETIC Rosalie! Just another Trump-supporting Far-right winger that espouses hypocrisy and nonsense! No matter what Obama does or not does will NEVER meet with your approval. Such as the case of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. Obama is "doing nothing" when he was captured. When rescued  Obama is wrong for bringing home this traitor. There will never be a "different outcome' with hypocrites like you. It will always be WRONG if a liberal/democrat POTUS does or not do. It will always be RIGHT if a conservative/republican POTUS does or not do the SAME THING!,1

10482,Anything that happens over a short period of time is statistically insignificant.,0
10483,That's one opinion Johnny. I can tell you that it wasn't pressure by the ADA that brought the training home to Alaska. It was putting a little blonde ADA president into a pair of Extratufs and flying her out to see the program in action that ended the lawsuit. I probably could dig out the ADAs final legal opinion if I looked around long enough. The program has proven itself for a good 10 years now. Enough to put that negativity behind it and prove that it works.,0
10484,The initials of the reverse face designer James Brown are present on most coins.,0
10485,Aren't "children"  up to the age of 26  covered by the parents' insurance plans?  I believe President Trump indicated he wouldn't change this.   Why the big push to keep Medicaid?  Under the law  most people must have health coverage or pay a fee. But you won’t have to pay this fee if you live in a state that hasn’t expanded Medicaid and you would have qualified if it had. If you can't afford any health plan and don’t qualify for coverage through Medicaid you can get low-cost health care at a community health center which can refer you to specialized care  including mental health.    There are plenty of these health centers in Alaska:  http://dhss.alaska.gov/dph/HealthPlanning/Documents/primarycare/FQHC%20List.pdf  We also have the Indian Health Service.    Kids covered by parents until 26  Natives free healthcare at IHS  workers through employers or Marketplace.  Disabled already covered. Retired and active military covered by VA/Tri Care....yet we need more $$ for Medicaid?,0
10486,So it sounds like these two Democrat spies need to pack up their sh!t and get back to NYC,1
10487,Zuri  first of all full disclosure you and Marilyn have agendas as you were both seeking the seat Beth currently holds. Secondly  you are insulting the residents of Mililani by assuming we are voting based on party affiliation.  I believe I am not alone in voting for the person I feel can do the best job for my community regardless of party. Maybe only 4% replied to her interest in switching parties. However  6.000+ Mililani residents voted for her and if the majority of them opposed her switch it would have been up to them to inform her of their objections. Seeing that this did not happen  the residents of Mililani must feel she is the best person for the job.,0

10490,I see it makes it easier for you to reject a different view by boiling down "most people in this country" to just  being "dumb".  Please continue to post. Your special insight helps illuminate so much more about yourself and your kind then those you denigrate.   Perhaps you relish the words of a fellow bigot who believed as you do.

10501,A lot of what passes for "art" these days is really little more than the making of crude statements using outrage and shock to draw attention to "work" (read statements) or "artists" that otherwise would never have received any attention. The use of rape to do so  and even by a social commentator like Zapiro using it in his cartoons  decontextualizes the real and serious issue of rape  turning it into a cheap political football. And even in this context the graphic depiction of rape is simply distasteful. I am sure there are better ways to get the same message across  although the "artist" might not receive the same undeserved attention.,0

10517,Bannon was openly contemptuous of Trump; if Trump didn't know it (and apparently he didn't)  he was the only one who didn't -- until Bannon called Robert Kuttner to express his contempt for Trump. For Bannon  Trump was a Useful Idiot  until he wasn't useful any more (hence the Kuttner interview); for Trump  Bannon was his guarantor to the racist  Nazi  KKK  white supremacist base that Trump would remain faithful to them.  Trump has secured that base; they know he is one of them and Trump no longer needs Bannon to be his ambassador to them.  Bannon in Trump's face (from Breitbart) is not significantly different from Bannon in Trump's ear (in the White House). From either perch  Bannon pulls Trump's strings  and one way or the other  Trump continues to dance to Bannon's antisemitic  racist tune. Despicable.,1

How many leaks have come from him since he's been office?? From  his own mouth or fingers since he likes to tweet so much!!! What about this whole Russian  collusion thing?? You gonna tell everyone "oh that's fake news"... Please!! If it looks like a duck walks like a duck and sounds like duck then my guess is it must be a duck!!!!!  Sad!!! How our country has became the laughing stock of the world!!!!! Government was created for the people by the people not billionaire idoits!!!!!! We as Americans need to take our country back!!!!!!,0
10522,Of course there will be an increase  especially when our leader makes statements like this:  "To those fleeing persecution  terror & war  Canadians will welcome you  regardless of your faith  diversity is our strength."  -and now  enforcement officials are turning a blind eye to this growing influx of economic migrants and refugees in order to save face for the person who made the above statement! How can you "welcome" people one minute and then turn around and refuse them entry or arrest them? Maybe our leader should revise his statement.,0

10527,Please elaborate. I am trying to gain real understanding to your veiw on this because im not sure if its misguided. Seei g how Oregon's Govenor signed into law yesterday a law lowering possession of Meth and other narcotics from Felonies to misdemeanors. Some say its a step forward in the right direction and am trying to make sense of it by looking at many different points of view on this War waged against the people in the Reagan administration that seems to drained alot of money with absolutely no evidence of any better off for it. Many of the symptoms drugs as meth cocaine heroin are accused of inflicting on a community  have been debunked in other countries who have claimed cognizant to the propaganda. So i guess i want to know if you have any real evidence that your not just on a bandwagon going the wrong direction?,0
10528,One America News Network  owned by the Herring’s.  Initially started by wealthy businessmen to rival Fox News.  They are hardly unbiased  their objective is to dispute any left leaning ideas.  The Herring agency was also contemplating the purchase of Al Jazeera America.   The T-Rump’s administration is less about informing our citizens of facts and truths.  And more about fostering total control of the USA by the wealthy.  Hence  his admiration for Putin  whose country is basically a Dictatorship/Oligarchy.,0

10541,The new technologies will more likely be developed in the U.S. as their taxes are reduced and ours go up.  Canada will import those technologies at higher cost.  Eventually it reaches a breaking point where citizens are fed up with a sluggish economy and higher cost of living  and they boot the socialists out of office.  Politics tends to go in cycles  and I don't think it is different this time.,0
10542,When hiring  I'm more interested in practical experience along with an engineering degree.

For one week in early November I was entitled to contribute: 227.39 For federal income tax 84.08 For Social Security 19.66 For Medicare 98.78 For Oregon state tax A one week tax bill of 429.91 (not including sales taxes on fuel and assorted government junk fees). In addition I sent the Lane County Tax Collector a check for 3269.16 on November 14th.  So Please Morgan Songi  do me a favor and take all my “entitlements” away!,0

10559,I can understand a few students who may require some form of tutoring...but a THIRD??

My children are currently in a French immersion program  and whenever we attend a parent/teacher conference  ANY shortcomings are ALWAYS the student's fault.

Mention of the BMO position in the US may be part of BMO's confidence to offer an investment thing  if I recall  labeled a G30?  100k gives me 417 dollars a month guaranteed for 20 years......and I can take the principal out anytime at little or no fee at whatever value it currently is.....the principal is declared safe for the 20 years @ 5% the duration.

10578,South of River St.  the Bayview extension and the LRT could be stacked on top of GO  with GO in a flood-proof tunnel  like the RER along the Seine  with a walking/bike path along the river. . The Bayview extension could be elevated to run flush with Gerrard  Dundas  and Queen  like the boulevard in Sarajevo beside the River - with a long LRT/GO/TTC station between Dundas & Queen.  . Since the DRL is going to go under Eastern Avenue  the LRT could branch west at Dundas  Queen (or to enter a portal and merge with the DRL) and King  while GO continues to Union. . Surface running on Dundas  Queen and King takes pressure off Union.  That means nested gauges.  Easier to get rid of TTC gauge. . It could move 40 000 riders/hour. It would take so much pressure off the Yonge line. It could run all the way to Richmond Hill. It would cost nothing compared to the DRL. It could be in service at least a decade before the DRL. . It could be so beautiful. So incredibly  stunningly  beautiful.,0

10588,It was the same anti gun crowd that Hitler sent to the gas chambers. 8 million of them. As I was growing up we had the cold war with Russia. Russia knew they could prevail over America militarily but would not be able to occupy America because every American house had multiple guns and Americans would not give up their guns or their country or their freedom. American gun ownership definitely kept peace in the world during the cold war. Americans value having the latest and best technology available to protect against criminals foreign and domestic  other countries and cartels  gangs and nut cases  and even our own government if necessary. If we would have allowed England to control our guns we would not be the USA today. In my opinion any anti gun or citizen disarmament is un American.,0

10592,As a non-American who vacations in the US often it is my opinion that Obama has indeed harmed your country. I have also noticed a marked increase in crime in the places I visit often during his tenure.  He has made your country look weak in the eyes of the world. Sad that a once great nation is now a country full of politically correct liberals that pander to the special interests and bow before weaker countries. I mean you pay off Iran and then let them intimidate you on the high seas!!!! Get a grip!!! Time to put on your big boy pants America and do something to change the world's view of you and stand up for yourselves. Failure to do so will bring the downfall of your nation as your enemies take advantage of your weakness!!!  I spend a lot of time vacationing in Alaska and have noticed this to be true throughout your state. It's sad to see over that last 10 years the increase in drugs  thefts and murders among other crimes.  Hopefully the decline can be turned around.,0

10601,What a disappointing trend. This trend is contrary to the Canadian dream of an egalitarian society where group identity does not matter. This trend is a reversion to tribalism and chauvinism - which Trudeau  Pearson and Dief fought. Marshall McLuhan also warned us in his analysis of the Global Village - which people wrongly thought he was an advocate of.  http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/marshall-mcluhan-the-global-village  Confrontational narcissitic alphas (like Trump) try to control the tribe by demonizing the other. The status seeking alphas use conflict to drive the process. Mcluhan saw conflict as a quest for identity  self esteem  status  ... instead of equal opportunity for all members of the human family.  Pluralism is achieved in constitutional rule of law nations  not in multi-mono cultures which divide  and finger point and demonize : http://www.marshallmcluhanspeaks.com/interview/1977-violence-as-a-quest-for-identity/,0

I do agree that The Chin would have ground The Hair Apparent into the dust in his prime and  for that matter  still could.  It is interesting that Brian is big enough to not visit the sins of the father on the son.  His own son Ben - more qualified in every way to be a potential PM than Justin was - struck up a friendship with Trudeau 2.0 years ago in Montreal and Brian got to know The Dauphin better. He may well have reflected that just as he didn't want his kids - all exceptional - to suffer the unfair attacks because they were his kids  neither did he want Justin to go through the same unfair treatment..  Anyhow  it is great for Canada he feels this way.,0

Ushakov says while Russia has shown “unusual flexibility ” Moscow’s patience “has its limits.”    He urged Washington to take action to “free Russia from the need to take retaliatory moves ” emphasizing that Moscow will feel obliged to respond if the matter isn’t settled.

He is a politician. That's what they do.  Our own beloved PM also lied during the  Canadian  election. Remember three small deficits of $10 billion  Or his pledge that tax increases for the "wealthy" and tax cuts for the middle class were to be revenue neutral and right after the election announced that they would cost over a billion How is that electoral reform he promised?.    He is a sexist pig So was Bill Clinton. So were many men of that generation. Our PM to his credit is much more responsive to women but also comes from a much younger generation.  Trump is disrespectful. Yes but he treats all his critics with equal contempt.   Trump is a bully and will do anything to win. Which is why so many in America voted for him.,1

We all agree- bringing the millrace back to life  and connecting this to the EWEB-City Hall project and the new riverside UO science development is both an exciting  vision and  a practical program.

10653,A *bit* of common sense is required here to assume there's a set matrix tree for deciding which non violent  non repeat offenders gets out early. Just because the paper doesn't *go through* those details with a fine toothed comb doesn't mean something inept is happening.   Your example of  theft of $50 is a *class C misdemeanor* with a *max* jail time of 30 days or up to *$1250 in fines*.  Realistically they are arrested  held for mere hours while being processed  then assessed the *fine*  then let go. So actually  your example costs the jail next to *nothing* and would actually *net* the county over hundreds to over a thousand dollars in collections over time. Only if the offender didn't pay the fine would this be a wash over a more likely net gain. That would trigger warrants & garnishments of property/wages.   For your measure11 plea bargain claim  can you cite your source on that please? Leave it to the RG comments section to pick the negative out of an otherwise positive article.,0

10681,The Russians got a free pass with feckless and weak Obama  but I don't think it will be the same with Trump.  He's already publicly embarrassed Putin an Lavrov by stating that they were either outplayed by Assad on still having chemical weapons - when Russia was supposed to ensure he didn't - or simply naively stupid.  The Crimea was clearly invaded by the Russians and stolen. The Ukriane has already been invaded by Russian forces and weapons  but the fight is far from over there.  The Russian military is no match for Western forces  except for their tank division. Every other part needs major upgrades and with sanctions  money is tight.  I suppose Putin's next move depends on what corrupt dictator wants to pay him for support to add to the billions he's already collected from corrupt dictators for his support. That is unpredictable alright  but not in the way you think.,1

10683,It is absolutely irrelevant that they all do it. The claim being made is that Obama went and asked GCHQ to conduct wire-tapping on Trump.  Nuance and details  tricky stuff eh? It is depressing how obfuscation has become the normal form of argumentation.,0

10693,I think historically  we've had plenty of periods where people came and contributed to Canada without learning an Official Language.  My own family history:  an ancestor came and established in a community that entirely spoke Gaelic.  It was the third most spoken language in Canada at the time of Confederation.  Now  I'd bet there isn't a single household in Canada that functions entirely in Gaelic.  ...And yes  that ancestor emigrated from the home country at a time when traditional tribal affiliations  dress and musical instruments were banned by the occupying forces of the day.  If anything  those became even stronger symbolic parts of identity than the language.,0

10710,Private school kids is all about sex and violence just like public school kids.  Once they start work  they will still be into sex and violence.

He is a very  very  smooth talker who tells lies.  A real snake.,1
10711,So he briefed congressional leaders...I don't recall hearing the likes of McCain or Graham or the rest raising the issue back then  before Trump was elected.  I wonder why not?

10715,"There are plenty of sane people on the right that oppose institutionalized discrimination." ============ And there are plenty of sane people on the left (okay  maybe "some") who realize that the issue is whether or not he is an "artist" who can lawfully decline to have his "artistic talents" "bought" in a way that offends him.....or whether he is a non-artist like a waiter or a motel clerk who cannot discriminate because "serving food" and "renting rooms" involves no "artistic talent.",0
10716,The people in government in Washington DC are living in a bubble. Life is going on in all of our states while all this hullaballoo is going on. Mail is being delivered  our children are being taught  pastors are preaching  servers are delivering our food to our tables  garbage is being picked up  and life is much the same now as it was before the elections. Both major political parties are empty shells that stand for nothing and Washington DC is as disconnected with the rest of America as it has been for decades.,0

10722,Sadly I see the size of administration in school buildings as the result of far too many lawyers.  There was a time when an assistant  principle catching a student smoking in the bathroom could deal with the issue. Now the assistant principle spends hours if not days dealing with the litigation and due process students are given.,0
10723,So pleased to see the draft-dodging  wannabe tough guy and GOP warmonger wants to keep putting American troops in harm's way  to support a tribal-based regime that couldn't care less about its country's welfare or security. The Russians made the right choice years ago and got out of this garbage pit. Trump's reasons for our continuing involvement smell like the stinking swamp in which he continues to mire himself. Welcome to Trumpistan.,1

10725,We need an Alt Right Gov. in Canada to stop this crap. Judges have no right to make laws. And by the sounds of it  they are trying to install a communist Gov.

10728,Is there a 'Looking for Solutions1"?    Jonah is conservative to everybody but those  on the extreme right.   I haven''t thought of 'Looking for Solutions' as being far right?    Jonah doesn't like Donald Trump  that doesn't mean he prefers liberal to conservative.     Now that Trump has found he can't just live in cloistered golden penthouse  his bitter  petulant  low brow insults are heard by most of America and the majority see it for what it is  including conservative Republicans.   They try to hold their nose  but eventually they have to come up for air.    That's right American citizens  not Trump employees.    He doesn't care  his followers don't care  but when you regularly demean other well intentioned people with personal slander  the rest of use have to wonder if you wouldn't  do the same to us.  That's human nature  not a political slight.   I've never had bullies in my circle of friends  or suffered crude insults in silence.,0

10731,There are over a million of these 'immigrants' in Canada now and increasing in number courtesy of the Trudeau Liberal policy on immigration.  They integrate but do not and cannot assimilate  and that's the problem.  They concentrate their communities in larger urban areas and their urban 'ghettos' are recognizable now.  Malmø  Sweden?  What will the future hold for Canada with such people living among us now and increasing in numbers?  I fear for my children and grandchildren.,0

10744,The clever part of the Trump EO is that the priority for those of a religious minority provision. The EO  gives no actually way to measure what religion is the minority.  In a country with multiple religions is the minority all those whose numbers are less than the single religion with the most members. Or is the minority the single religion with the least numbers. any-event a priority based on religion is clearly stated in the Executive Order. That is clearly in violation of the 1965 law  the Hart-Celler Act     Hopefully we will see SCOTUS rendering an opinion on this soon.,0

10756,Hi  to such a finely proposed question I do have one...the answer lies in the process of being mindful how your food gets there. If your using powdered supplements then it's up to you as the consumer to know where it comes from and possibly make it yourself. Maybe growing vegetables and salads opposed to buying it. That's the evolution of life in a matrix world  when virtually everything has a low-grade convenience form,0
10757,You are right  I totally missed it!  Please send me the fact by fact rebuttals. I'm not afraid of facts or the truth. I will never bend reality to fit a preconceived notion which is why I made the correction regarding the Clinton Foundation.  What do you think the reason is for shutting down their Clinton Global Initiative?,0
10758,Which is why everything is going on behind closed doors for national security reasons. Your nothing burger sees to have a secret Trump sauce to flavour everything.,0
10759,Thanks for proving once again the facts and circumstance are a foreign concept to you.

10763,When someone supports an issue usually they think it is a great thing or that they will personally profit from outcome. From reading so many comments from both sides and doing the math this is never more true than with measure 97. Those in favor are public employees or will profit  some how that's all that matters. The ones against are the ones that learned to think for themselves and how to do simple math. This is just one more committee staffed mostly by incompetent people whose goal in life is to live off the work of others other wise known as want to be bureaucrats.,0
10764,Brennan is a traitor to the American People.  I hope Trump has all these shadowy scumbags thoroughly investigated.,1

10767,She one CUUUUTE Korean and smart  too. Later married the black Mayor. Smart and hard jazz tiny child who actually executed hard decisions. Got national media coverage. Fought the teachers' union and lost. Too bad. Now black kids stay stupid. Are we going to support Ms. Kishimoto? That's only half the battle. The other half is trying to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. Our kids are stupendously STEEYOUPID!!!,1
10768,Yes I would. The easiest way and the cheapest way to put a communist country under is via pure capitalism. Have a look at USSR and China? If we had been a little smarter than JFK and his dumb ass little brother we would have invited Cuba to trade on very lucrative terms and been done with them by 1970 or so.,1
10769,No fucking creepy American style healthcare.  NONE AND ANYONE WHO SCREWS WITH IT IS GOING TO GET THEIR HEADS CAVED IN POLITICALLY AND BUSINESS WISE.  We won't stand for this shit.  In or out.  Bill all private or bill on the program.  NEVER BOTH.  If people want to throw their money away they will pay.  I think BC should loose it healthcare funding if they allow this travesty to continue.,1

10777,You might want to read the article again.  The full federal report clearly outlines that they had bad leadership  bad training  and an overwhelming belief that they are better than the citizens that they are supposed to serve.  Many of them are arrogant and racially biased.  They are poorly educated about the people who pay their wages.  I like what the writer says:  "But if we should appreciate the difficulties of their jobs — and how well most handle those difficulties — it’s not too much to ask one more thing of police: to be fair to people of all makes and models."   We want to respect them  is it not too much to ask that those who WE pay to help us  respect us as well?,0

10780,Trump is such an idiot.  When the President speaks like this  he's massively escalating the issue to implicate the 1st Amendment.  Now  I wonder if every NFL team kneels for the National Anthem tomorrow - not in protest of "social injustice" or "police brutality" or some such tripe  but in support of the 1st Amendment!  And  as a constitutional conservative  I would likely support such NFL players kneeling in protest.,1
10781,Um  Stalinists weren't "progressives"; they were Communists. The president of the United States is a dictator-wannabe supported by neo-Nazis  bigots  theocrats  authoritarians and fantasists  and Rogue's worried about liberals.  Troll.,1
10782,Here's just a few - tons more if you ever figure out how to search on the internet:   * "Dead Broke" - Claim Hillary made leaving the white house - even left-leaning Politifact found that to be a lie;  * "Sniper Fire" - During 2008 campaign Hillary claimed to have come under sniper fire in Bosnia. Claimed her group had to run "with our heads down to get into vehicles..." - Thank goodness videos of her landing proved her lies;  * "Immigrant Grandparents" - Hillary claimed "all my grandparents came over here..." - another story Politifact said was a lie - only one of her grandparents was an immigrant;  * "Sir Edmund Hillary" - Hillary claimed she was named after Sir Edmond Hillary (Mt. Everest fame). Obvious lie since he didn't climb Everest until she was 6 years old;  * "Marines" - Hillary claimed to have applied to be a Marine in 1975 and was turned down. Washington Post fact-checkers verified that was a lie;  I could go on much more but there is a post length limit.,0

10786,There is a glaring double standard  of course. When Bill Clinton was embroiled in sex scandals  the conservatives were salivating over the details and were oh  so concerned about his victims  none of whom were very credible as unwilling participants. He was impeached. Only Monica had evidence: of a consensual relationship! But that still doesn't stop the haters into bringing all that back up again. Bill Cosby's accusers have no credible evidence  either  and many have very dubious stories that should be inspected before taken as fact. But Cosby has already been found guilty without the benefit of due process  even before real charges were brought against him. Weinstein appears to behave as a guilty party  and his business and reputation are destroyed.  But the real double standard  that Caldera has completely ignored  is sitting in the WH right now  his own dozens of accusers silenced and his own deviant behavior ignored and set aside. Talk about powerful men getting away with assault.,0

I and millions of others  don't want OUR tax money used to help fiance your efforts to harbor illegal criminals in your town. Take a collection  set up a charity  do anything but use MY money.

Both of these companies are focused on AK Native healthcare and the effects of their efforts are far reaching by directly/indirectly affecting the lives of all Alaskan's. What they have done and continue to do is pretty amazing. While you sit in your chair coveting the incomes of their board members  these companies are of the front lines battling the sexual assault and drug/alcohol abuse that is so rampant in Alaska right now. They have programs designed to help the healing process and attempts to fix more than just the symptoms of the problem. One of these companies is recognized worldwide as an authority on healthcare. .

All any country has to do is launch a satellite let it go around a few times and touch off a radiation bomb over the US and you are in the stone ages. Think about what we have lost in the last 3 generations in the ability to take care of yourselves  can you grow a garden  can you start a fire  can you milk a cow  can you even sew on a button  can you fix your car  can you wash cloths without a washer  ever use a handsaw or go for days without adult guidance and that goes for you adults.

10820,After the budget is further cut across the board I support restructuring the permanent fund. Afrer those two steps were completed I would support a flat sales tax & a system of users fees. The users fees would be paid by those who use the government services. I would never support an income tax where I am forced to pay for someone else's bills in government spending along with my own bills.,0
10821,That you are a misogynistic pig.,1
10822,It is hard to disagree with you despite being a conservative all my life.  I already pay taxes to cover politicians  retired politicians  government employees  retired government employees  military personnel  veterans  the poor  the disabled  the incarcerated  the elderly  and native Americans. The only group I can think of besides hard-working people like me are the lazy and irresponsible and I do not think it is fair to ME  to have to pay another dime to cover the lazy and irresponsible.  If I have to pay any more at this point  we might as well cover those us who are paying the bill for everyone else. We are tired of being called "selfish". The truly selfish are those who want health care coverage  but expect their neighbors to pay for it.  We ALL need to pay our way.  I do not really trust my government to do a very good job of this. I trust insurance companies even less. Now they are in bed with each other. This was a stupid idea.,1
10823,This makes my blood boil  if our government does not give a crap about guarding our borders  and sticking to the law of the land  they need to go.  Not one of these should be Refugees  they came from a safe country.  WTF?,1
10824,Morrigan  thank you for your response.   Recess appointment - granted the Supreme Court barely overturned that one.   I'm not a constitutional scholar but I will address your allegation of "killed 4 Americans overseas".  W. Bush made it legal to take out terrorists overseas with an executive order (and BTW W signed more EOs than Obama).  And allegedly 1 was a target  3 accidental.  I don't like the drones either  but we simply cannot have all our able-bodied military as well as national guard overseas killing people.  Besides the moral issue  W tried that and look at the horrible quagmire it made  and even after all that  it was Obama that took out Bin Laden. And as to making health insurance available to millions more Americans rather than having them go bankrupt or die in the gutter because of illness?  It's high time we caught up with the rest of the civilized world.  If anything he did there was unconstitutional why didn't the Supremes take it out?  Oh wait they said it was ok.,0

Racist-in-Chief? Hmmm  maybe Nazi-in-Chief would be more fitting.,1
10833,Your 'fact' stands ONLY if one includes sales tax revenue in the analysis...  Sales tax is a 'pass-through' tax - the overhwelming majority of which is paid by end-consumers like you and me - not businesses.  Businesses just collect the sales taxes and submit it to the state - they don't even count it as revenue.  So why not be honest rather than mislead and demonize one certain class of businesses for just following Oregon's laws the same as all the others?,0

If there are established neurological or psychological symptoms that affect the memory  attitude  behaviour  etc. of some assault victims which may affect their functioning as a witness (which I don't doubt)  it is the job of the Crown Prosecutor to introduce those factors into evidence for consideration by the judge with respect to the testimony of a witness allegedly so affected.

I wonder how much of it was information that should have been in the public domain but was being kept out of public eyes by either the Democrats?  Hillary and her Democratic buddies are just throwing cow pies at the wall hoping that some of it will stick to ease the pain of her well-deserved defeat.  She lost the election because people realized that basically Trump  regardless of his faults  was a better person than Hillary.,0

Good Grief  why do those who call fracking safe don't live where fracking is next door trying to come in.,0
10854,Agree.  If Alaskans actually cared about protecting against wildfires started by fireworks  a statewide ban on fireworks would have been implemented after the 1996 Miller's Reach/ Big Lake fire.  I guess legislators think debating about our time zone is more important than preventing massive fires caused by fireworks and the stupid people that buy them.,1
10855,The way seeds were modified before GMO is called mutagenesis. The breeder puts a bunch of seeds in a chemical bath or blasts them with radiation to force mutations. The mutant seeds are then grown and inspected for desirable traits. 100s of genes are modified in each trial.   This is a completely unregulated practice that's been in use for about 100 years. Many organic crops were made this way.   You already have lived long enough to see the manipulation of DNA; humans have been doing it in variety of ways for 10 000 years. We're just better at it now that we used to be.,0

10894,If I were in the business I am speaking about and everyone in the same business had the same opportunity to get the same $500 000 tax credit  and I chose not to  I would be stupid.  If I had shareholders  such as people like myself on my investments and I failed in my fiduciary duty to those shareholders by not taking that tax credit it would and should have severe consequences for me personally.  I claim my mortgage interest  my property taxes  the reduced taxability of my social security benefits   my elderly status  my marital status  my medical deductions and all of the other  tax  exemptions or credits which I am legally able to claim.    I expect others to do the same.    If you do not claim any of those things  that is your decision.    Claiming them does not make me evil and not claiming them does not anoint you as a saint.   The same applies to anyone else in the United States  even Trump.  In his businesses he just has many more opportunities than others.  Maybe he is smarter,0

10903,Bob I am trying to get the word out about my Plan "The Alaska Land Voucher Program"  That's why I am using the title AK Land Voucher.. By the way I cleared over a square mile for a farmer out at Point McKenzie in the 80's and built 3 miles of the main road to help make it happen. Also Dale Alsop's Road  ! I firmly believe we Alaskans need very desperately to get that Pioneer Spirit Back in our hearts so this seemingly depressive notion doesn't take hold! We are tough stock and can weather this out if we believe in ourselves and don't depend on government before it's to late. Redistribution of wealth is not the answer as some think. Lets get moving  lets build a greater Alaska. I am 61 now but love my state and want a future for my Son and Grandson. We can do it if government will get out of the way and not Tax us out of the opportunity's we deserve. We need both the PFD and the Land to make it happen.. This program does nothing but GOOD! Please support it.,0

10905,The Press is sickening ad naseum.   When interviewed by the press to comment on a newly implemented system of operation at work;  I said that the new system worked very well and that there is always room for further improvement in any system.  All that the paper wrote in the article of my comments was that I stated that there was room for improvement with the system.  True but very typical of what I see in today's press - selective reporting.  Reporting in the press that a jury said that one is guilty by conveniently missing the word "not" is bias in its purest form.,0

10911,So the company that made it  had a flag ship game called ingress. The poke stops were places from the first game. Granted it didn't catch on as large as pokemon. It let's you submit places of significant for historic  cultural  artistic significance. The reason merrily feild was added was probably because of all the charter companies that do tourism flights out of there. It's not the makers fault they are there. Notice how the last 4 years ingress has been arround  you never heard of these problems. Pokemon is very user friendly towards all ages  and has only been out a week and is causing issues because a lot of the youth that plays doesn't exercise common sense.,0

However  I do think any party with a sizeable percentage of the popular vote should have official party status. That's 12 seats. If any party can make 3..55% of the vote should be given 12 seats in Parliament. If they win four regular seats  they could be granted eight seats at large. It would not eliminate the possibility of majority government. Proportional rep would.,0
10916,An article in BBC news today claims that fifty percent of jobs in the United States will disappear in the next fifteen years because of technology. This includes jobs replaced by robots   such as self-driving cars and trucks  most service industry work  construction and manufacturing  (because of 3D printing)  and even many professionals. It's not just about temporary foreign workers  although they will add to the misery. An example given is that a guy in say Nigeria will be able to remotely operate robots to clean hotel rooms for a fraction of what it would cost to pay an American worker.  Currently no one has a solution.  Governments really have to begin to plan on how to implement guaranteed incomes.  Or does anyone have a better idea?,0

10925,Look at the facts: AK mining dam engineer (forgot his name) said in a mtg in Dillingham years ago "all tailings dams leak". It takes a massive pump back system to "mitigate" the effluent. Forever!  Most all (>90some %) of open pit mines have created water contamination issues. Most  if not all of those mines  occur in desert environments. Pebble prospect is located in essentially a swamp. Bristol Bay is the largest salmon producer in the world because we have allowed all the others to be destroyed by fragmenting or polluting the vital habitat. People only think about the adult salmon that we harvest  eat  or run up the river. But w/o intact habitat and water their is no place for the eggs to incubate or the juvys to survive long enough to head to the ocean (where habitat is also being stressed) to come back to our plates  smokers  or to spawn. The state of Alaska permitting process is flawed. We have never denied a development/extraction project. Think long v short term!  EPA=help,0

Should have tased his ass  read his rights and shoved his ass in the back of the patrol car. For those that scream "racism" - I think they should do that to everyone who is wanted for outstanding warrants for charges of "reckless endangerment and discharge of a firearm". It is safer for the public  and the asshat criminal. We pay cops to protect the public  not give criminals with a known history the benefit of the doubt and hope they will do the polite thing and go easily without a fight.

Anyone desiring to learn more can use the cite I gave and move forward as deep into the issue as they wish to go.  I first started my learning in this subject matter area around 1980 when I noticed a substantial increase in our police calls in this area but sadly noticed a lack of in-service in this subject matter area.  Fortunately  management was willing to invest individual training for me in this area with the idea that eventually I would train our officers.   I would not call myself an expert here  but do think I have more than average knowledge on this subject.,0

10961,I'd argue that a major focus needs to be on creating a climate that is respectful and compassionate toward victims. The way it is now  too many victims of this crime don't bother to come forward because they do not have confidence that their case will go anywhere  and they are afraid of how they will be viewed and treated within the system and by the public.  We need to shift the narrative that immediately questions a victims credibility and puts the onus on the accuser to prove their own innocence. We need victims to feel supported and believed when they come forward. That is not asking for a person to be convicted and tried based on nothing but an accusation. It's simply asking that an alleged victim be treated with care throughout the process.,0

10964,It is arguable that the damage is the result of the original decision to conduct illegal surveillance of the nation's citizens.

10970,No its not just you. These idiots should not be running businesses. What in the heck ever happened to the 'COST OF DOING BUSINESS!!'  Apparently these are NOT conservative companies nor do we have conservative republicans. We have nothing but democrats and that twat rick rydal is a liberal. Why else would he and his fellow 'so-called' republicans support paying a business to operate?!  So freaking ridiculous how we allow these people to screw over the state and people time and again. Screw this  we just need to say hell with it and nationalize the whole damn thing and do it ourselves. HELL WE ALREADY PAY THEM TO DO THE WORK WHY THE HELL NOT!!!!!!,1

EWEB can't take your house if you don't pay like the City and County government can if you don't pay your property taxes.  If you really believe that Albertson's or Wal-Mart wasn't going to pass that 2.5% extra cost on with a 20 minute re-program of their computers you are delusional.  Fred Meyer and Safeway monitor your spending so closely that you get coupons which match the things you buy so they can get the maximum profit from your purchases.  They do that on an individual basis person by person.  Some corporations price their products on a store by store basis.  Go to a Freddy's in Lake Oswego and price similar items between there and other demographic locations around the State.  Then check out the prices in other Freddy's in other states.,0

10981,Thank you  Patrick  for permission to make comments in the comments section. I still don't see how this proves I prefer assumptions over investigations. I am merely stating that the attacker's actions appear to be politically motivated. This assertion is supported by reported witness accounts and reported investigations into the attacker's online activity. I fail to see how stating that it the attacker's motives appear to be politically motivated due to overwhelming information that has been made publicly available proves that I prefer assumptions over investigations. Aren't the reported facts about the case also the results of an investigation (albeit a journalistic investigation)? If you also care about facts and truth  then are you saying that only a police investigation can provide facts and truths? If so  then are you saying that a police investigation can never produce untruthful and factually baseless results? I doubt that is the case either.,0

Posting questionable comments on this site doesn't fit the character of a true patriot.  Perhaps you have a fantasy of a wannabe patriot.,0
10985,Since the case was decided by Comey by himself and not by a Federal Prosecutor or a Grand Jury  it was his opinion that ended the investigation  not a legal ruling.    Comey's decision has the same weight as a traffic cop giving out a warning instead of a citation.    Need I re-quote his actual words about 'no reasonable prosecutor'?    How about all the negative things he said about Hillary's judgement?  Do you want me to re-quote them as well?  Revisionist history Eric; one of your strengths until the facts are shoved down your throat.,0
10986,It really should be up to people  to choose what they want to use.  As long as no one else is being harmed.  If people want to use it for medicine or to relax or just have a good time  it really depends on the person  and the type of marijuana they choose.  I'm sure you know there are psychoactive and non-psychoactive components in marijuana plants  depending on the species  hybrid  choice of consumption  etc.    My only issue is that driving under the influence when impaired is not recommended  and that denying that marijuana is psychoactive (in total) is a useless battle.    Thanks for your feedback.,0
10987,I believe that you  like most Americans  conflate social license with civil rights.    A civil right is about the relationship between the individual and the government.   I can exercise my civil right to freedom of speech and it means that the government  at ALL levels of government in the US  cannot arrest or prosecute me  or confiscate my property for exercising my right.     An American's right to free speech  however  is not a social license.  It doesn't mean there will be no social consequences to what we say or write.    We can be criticized  divorced  evicted from the store  the job  the park  etc.  for the things we say and write.  But the government still can't arrest us.  You falsely equate Mr. Kaepernick's act of protesting undeniable racial injustice that still exists for many Americans  with you having the freedom to criticize him for his act of protest  and you're only half correct.  Yes  you can criticize Mr. Kaepernick and we won't call the police or the military.,0

10989,From experience it is honestly very hard to raise a family in these times.  I live in Toronto (yes  I know  Toronto  but this is where I was born and raised).  We bought our house back in 2008  so while pricey  nowhere near costs today.  We have one car (7 years old) and full paid off  and one child now in JK. Even with our income ($150 - 200)  we live comfortably but by no means extravagantly.  Our house is small (1 200 sq ft) and we've done some renovations but nothing HGTV worthy  and many necessary boring stuff (furnace).  We both worked for 15 years in an industry with no pension so all our savings were our own.  So between living (housing  utilities  insurance  maintenance  etc) savings (short and long term) and raising our daughter  we look at having a second and aren't sure how to do it without significant impact to savings and just leading a nice life.  And yes  I know we have a great income  but that was from years  progressing in our careers (we are now almost 40).,0

10993,As McGuigan said  Poloz's protests that the inflation target is symmetric is a bit of a joke as over the last four years  the time he has been Governor  the annualized rate of inflation has been 1.5%  substantially below the 2.0% target. In fact  there is no reason that the target should be set as high as 2.0%. The 2016 renewal of the inflation control agreement admitted as much. A 2.0% target now is like a 2.2% target at the time of the 2011 renewal agreement. A move to annual basket updates in the CPI would push the effective target rate up even higher  where there is no need to go. See my 2017 paper "Why the Bank of Canada's Target Rate of Inflation Should Be Lowered" for more information:  http://economics.ca/2017/papers/BA0017-1.pdf,0
