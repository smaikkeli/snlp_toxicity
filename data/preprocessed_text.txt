this is proof . . . there are liberals out there that are truly liberal . . . awesome sir . . . it is sadly the canadian way . a few years ago some brave montreal cops killed a cow and then in calgary a cougar and in banff a couple of wolves . no wild creatures are exempt from our brave police forces ability to kill them . possibly . but there sure is a lot of hype about kelly considering he s never even taken a preseason snap . i do think a fa is a possibility but obviously this would be unique circumstances . i keep thinking about the vikings . with teddy b active they re now carrying qbs on their roster . the top don t interest me but sloter is one of them . he might be worth kicking the tires on . probably the one beer triggered this clown and i am sure he enjoyed his freedom to act like a reckless moron . but his freedom even as an america stops when he endangers passengers and a commercial aircraft . too often these days people feel their personal issues and angst has to be everyone else s issue too . it is my understanding that cabela s loss of calculators from theft is one of the lowest in the industry . she doesn t look all that hot now . by ? crypt keeper with face lifts . . . brava sharon w . smith md mph oh he apologized ? i didn t know that so everything is okay now . we should start lining up our criminals to see if they re sorry and if so let em walk free with some spending money . finally ! ! get those stinking bums out of there and drop them off at sand island and lock the gate ! ! they make such a mess why can t they be made to pick up all their stinking trash . they worst than wild pigs . freaking messing up wherever they plant themselves . also get rid of those freakin bums who stand out there on the pali off ramp costco and other places hold this freaking stupid cardboard that says please help disable no work . well if you can stand for freakin hrs acting like a poor soul well you can stand at the mcdonalds counter and take orders or you can carry a broom and sweep and clean toilets . i can t stand these bums and freeloaders . can t stand um ! ! ! get rid of them stinking bums who make life miserable for all the hard working law abiding and tax paying citizens . get that rat gov and rat mayor out there and clean up this state and city ! let them set up their camps at city hall and state capitol or at ige s house across the capitol . get plenty room for all . it s just primarily that most of the movie is really crude and you know for a guy that usually does humor that s a little better than this i mean it can be slapstick and silly but not usually quite this level of just crude stupidness all well and good to promote equal rights . as long as the right person gets the job for the right reasons . when it comes to investing in a company to make a profit i want the best person for the job and my profit line does not care about sex race colour etc . actually wasn t it thatcher and reagan i m not all that familiar with sinclair and the stations they own and run . politico had a piece recently that said sinclair would require their stations to regularly use a certain commentator which is understandable . it helps brand the stations under a common identity . i think sharyl attkisson who i remember from one of the big networks hosts a sunday meet the press type show . it makes sense for their stations to use her work as opposed to paying for someone else . it s business . if those re enactments included over deaths that occurred during the civil war would it make any difference ? from less than billion deficit in mr . harper s last year now ballooned by and you call trudeau morneau a success ? that other countries have bigger deficits than ours is a success in your world ? that s what s wrong with the liberal thinking . . . spend spend spend . don t worry our children can repay the deficit ! maxine waters is the epitome of stupid . but more so are the voters who keep sending her back to washington . she is totally irrelevant in our political process except for a few laughs along the way . there yet remains one crucial ingredient in determining what will come of the climate new reality this market is currently faced with a little thing called interest rates . guess what they are about to start ever so slightly albeit going up . those that over extended themselves buying a house because they figured why not it ll go up another yoy anyways are going to feel the pinch . on the other side those contemplating buying a house will see a higher cost of carrying a mortgage and will need to be more discerning and careful . the new reality is that the madness insane buyer psychology of q is gone and will not be returning while the cost of mortgages will gradually and likely continually increase . you will absolutely see the same corresponding decline in prices . . . theres just no way around this . i did not see any scolding in this comment . just some advice as many people who can understand what is going on around them can not express their feelings or needs . i think gay is a unique way to describe this nonsense . but why bring in sexism to this conversation ? gay has not meant happy jolly or fun loving for the last one hundred years . and it has never meant lame stupid ridiculous except to a few morons that were not gay . james just how old are you ? when were you a small kid ?

<|startoftext|><|0|> many hi tech companies are also outsourcing more than ever . . . .first it was manufacturing but now they are also outsourcing engineering developer work . canada and us are losing many good paying jobs . why does the gov t not force the companies to keep the jobs locally for hi tech ? labour costs are more expensive sure but the cost of living is also going through the roof so we need good paying jobs ! ! this global economy only benefits the corporations ! c mon canada get it right ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! <|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|><|0|> acfh i m still trying to figure out why they need combined offices at all . with all the money they waste on travel and per diem combined with the money they are willing to waste on purchasing buildings it seems to me that they could each get an allowance and rent a small space somewhere in their own respective districts get an internet connection and use state issued cell phones for their voice communication . if they feel they need one or more assistants they would be required to justify that expense . meet in juneau for legislative sessions any travel out of or back to juneau for anything other than state approved business medical reasons or an actual emergency is paid out of their own pocket . sounds a lot more practical to me than stroking their already over inflated gargantuan egos . it s not all of the anchorage legislators that are willing to waste the money on purchasing buildings that no one needs it s only the chosen few . remember in november . <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|><|0|> brett sure ijournalism can be nuanced . but comments by definition aren t journalism . and conflating the two as you have here creates a more poisonous atmosphere in comments on this issue . often news organizations go out of their way to solicit comments from interested parties . fact based articles in a news article are fact checked . and shouldn t even require my basic point you can require conflict of interest statements they are common in peer reviewed science journals . your response about nuance actually misses the basic point of how you define a conflict of interest . and that is indeed usually clear and not what you imply . you are basing your opinion on a fuzzy deffinition that comments are journalism . and a simplistic view of what a conflict of interest is . readers discern very quickly whether your are being fair and representing all readers . clearly from comments here the judgement is you aren t ! being fair . and you should not represent yourself as our rep . <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|><|0|> if the problem you are trying to fix is low percent of voter turnout then creating a larger voter base by randomly signing up driver license applicants is the last thing you should consider . the voter base was broadened too much in the s when the federal motor voter rules were enacted . before motor voter hawaii had an consistently percent turnout . after it dropped to into the s . encouraging folks who have no real intention of voting to register guarantees a weak turnout percent . a lot of the folks applying for a license are temporary residents who will be gone in two years . the federal rules also restrict the county clerks from eliminating non participants for two election cycles . our rolls are already cluttered with names of folks who no longer live here or who will never vote . signing more folks up automatically will only make the problem worse . <|endoftext|>
