0,I get the odd feeling Klastri  the head of the ACLU of Hawaii  will step in and defend this scum for freedom of speech.,?
1,I couldn't disagree more with this column; Canadians have moved on and don't care how primarily the Progressive media and others label people. Why don't we stop putting labels on people.  Singh's biggest problem will be if he has to under the LEAP agenda. It really is that simple.,?
2,Does the property owner have a vote in the  tax increase?  And maybe it's time to scale back the parks  and a government worker retirement that comes with these parks.  If the neighborhood wants the park let them maintain it without government. If the neighborhood doesn't like the park let it go to waste.  There must be greener pastures outside of the state and the ponytail man,?
3,Shawn  do you think it may be due to the fact our "public servants" are not in that catagory now? Public servants  did not  expect full  better then our retirements  higher wages and associated  they did it for service at no pay expected. Now  they pad their pockets  think we are stupid and continue on. I do  for one  believe this next election cycle may  I hope  change it?,?
4,You proved she turned over 100% of the relevant emails... thats funny because the Washington Post proved that she didn't turn over relevant emails.  https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/08/22/the-fbi-found-15000-emails-hillary-clinton-didnt-turn-over-uh-oh/?utm_term=.3fa25fb76c6f  "the FBI found several thousand work-related emails that had not been previously turned over by Clinton."  And this by a Clinton ally.  You lost here you lost there and you are to dumb to get out of the game.  Let me say that again SLOWLY so you can understand it it... QUIT LYING and give it up already.  Its pathetic.,?
5,Looks like all teachers MUST be placed on the No-Fly list now. And teachers should not be allowed to buy guns either. Clearly  ALL teachers are lunatics that can't be trusted. We must remove all teachers from the classroom. We must make schools Teacher Free Zones.,?
6,Well  they haven't made it illegal to store rainwater. The tech is available  and even if you can't store it "drinkably safe" - it can still be used for things like watering the garden and doing the laundry (I know it can be stored/purified for safe drinking - just considering options should one be unable to afford the tech for that).,?
7,Why did we elect these fools to run the country? They can't even roll out marijuana legalization.  something any corner store could do.,?
8,Check your privilege.  Why do you automatically assume the women selected are less meritous than men (especially white men)?  Just because a bunch of white guys weren't chosen for every job in sight  you cry discrimination.  What a hypocrite.,?
9,"had"...  and  is now outed as a hypocrite.,?
10,In reverse order  thanks! It's not the wealth  it's how you use it.  Choice is great  but I'm sure you've heard this one before; One way or another  we wind up paying. Every time someone wraps a Buick around a pole the GDP goes up.  And hey  it's not like Ralph got himself a Constituional amendment.   Do what he did - petition your government to repeal seat belt laws.    We voted for it.  Undo the stuff you don't like via the democratic process.  that's how we got to where we arre today.  Well . . . sorta!,?
11,Wrong again.  The US cannot withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement until November 2020  but be my guess  open yourselves up to the consequences of an early withdrawal.  Suivante - next  Again  is there a single Trump supporter here who has actually read the agreement ?,?
12,Yeah  the evils of the past should be papered over.,?
13,We need to amend the laws to enforce that.,?
14,Pay attention people!  When politicians  "entertainers"  and TV talking heads  use the words " F**k You Trump! When "comedians"  stand with mock severed heads of our President  When "actors"  and directors  believe it is OK to show a mock assassination of our President as Caesar  in a Shakespeare play ....... There will be wacko fans of the Radical Madcow who feel that it is not only alright to kill the President or those of his party  but feel it is their duty to do so. This is what the Left has created with their vitriol. And they have the nerve to attack Rush Limbaugh as a Hate mongerer.  The HATE has been coming from the Left every single day since Trump was elected. These killings are blood on their hands!,?
15,Bullshit. You just like to kill. There is a high cost paid  for every "free" animal you kill so you can a "macho mountain man." A true Alaskan and human being is a caretaker not just of the land but every living thing on it.,?
16,If  the thin skinned trump wasn't p**** grabbin liar  and a  vindictive bully    maybe I would be a  trump lover like you  too.  lol,?

19,Rude comment! How can you say that we are better off with him gone? Do you want to tell his children that? Jerk!,?
20,She will most likely thrive in stir  she has the look of prison royalty about her. At least  she shouldn't be able to breed for the length of her time in our care. What's scary is the prodigious anger that will be released in ten years.  This is a perfect case of someone killing themselves with dope  and an innocent getting in her way. There is no way for her to pay  only to be punished. I could slap her myself.,?
21,Holy hannigan are you fools still out there? It was called stimulus and was voted on by all three parties with the Liberals have NDP wanting more. Grow up.,?
22,Malaysia’s Maritime Enforcement Agency said the area is at the start of a designated sea lane for ships sailing into the Singapore Strait  one of the world’s busiest. ====== The ships going through there are required to split into 2 lanes to pass the narrow waterway  and McCain entered into a wrong one. They are too obsessed with the "freedom of navigation".,?

27,ridiculous  but it's OK to let and encourage "children" about transgender......,?
28,Say what you want about the Clinton Machine.  What you can't deny is that you can't throw a spitwad in the White House without hitting someone who is in deep with Russians.  Treason  greed  and idiocy got you your Trump - the Facebook subpoenas  Cambridge Analytics and Trumps tax returns will show your hero for what he is: a failure at business  draft-dodging loon.,?
29,BLM will have to relinquish control of Pride next year. I vote for the police  in full uniform and vehicles get pride of place leading the parade in 2018  the same as was granted to BLM this  year.,?

34,The Democratic party steamrolled Bernie and they think his supporters are idiots who will vote for Hillary in the end anyway. Trump beat his opponents fair and square. Can Hillary claim as much??,?
35,It's alarming to me that this issue has continued to drag on.  One January 16th thousands of people rallied at the Capitol. Their message was EDUCATION IS A CIVIL RIGHT.  What about the 19th District? Is anyone listening to the citizens?,?
36,"Where is your outrage over Bill's 40 reported rapes of women and children? This man has made 27 trips to pedophile island to have sex with children and nobody on the left could care less"  So this is how you slander and demean Bill Clinton? Your obsession to link him and HRC with anything sick and disgusting  is sick and disgusting. You really bring out the worst in yourself when you repost the sludge found on extremist websites.,?
37,Hi  Canadians are stupid  as we allowed foreign speculators to ruin this country badly. The situation will deteriorate if we don't take actions. We are just a herd of sheeples leading to the slaughterhouse by the special interest groups and politicians.,?

40,Greedy pigs  that's all I can say.,?
41,A loser making fun of a winner.  How rich...,?
42,That was a lot of work to create a ridiculous straw man.,?
43,The Rebel hates Muslims and anything to make Muslims look bad they will run.  They are a hate site against Muslims and should be treated as such.,?
44,Perhaps we have a big swamp to drain in Juneau?   Lest find  some folks who actually want to represent Alaskans instead of special interests.,?
45,You're making fa-t jokes  seem to be denying climate change and are still worried about looking like an idiot ?  I would say you have no real worries there.,?
46,So its OK for american Serena Williams to cheat but not the russian?  Tennis has always been a bullshit sport played by brats,?
47,Oh....I almost forgot the law that states only white people and the Government are allowed to control land they own or charge for using it....silly me.,?
48,How do you know the officer is an "out of shape donut eater" and how do you know they had assault weapons?  I bet s/he could take you any time you wanted. Grow up or shut up.,?

50,The photo is of 3rd baseman Will Scott  not Gorrell.,?
51,That government is not the BC liberals  who could have chosen not to exempt pre-sales from the 15% tax  like Ontario is doing.,?
52,Generally  l believe the uneducated (college etc.) don't get basic economics and why unskilled and technically skilled jobs have left the US and Canada and translates to lower cost goods. How many Trump supporters would be willing to pay double and triple the price for iphones  clothes etc. so they can get paid high wages to produce them?,?
53,"In the U.K.  we need to dig deep and ask some difficult questions about how we got here. We need to seek equally difficult answers that will lead us to real and grounded solutions. In short  we need political honesty. We need leaders who have the integrity and conviction to instigate real change  from how we develop and conduct our domestic policy to how we align our foreign policy."   Sorry but what do you believe these difficult questions are?  It seems even the author of this article doesn't want to say it.  No one wants to be honest with each other.,?
54,Corporate elites? This is structural job losses from technological advancement and this is JUST THE BEGINNING.   In the next 10-15 years  AI is going to literally wipe out of 20-30% of all full-time jobs. In 20 years  with improvements in robotics + AI the number will skyrocket. In a millennials' lifetime  a robot will make them breakfast  if they can afford it. This is the time to drop the platitudes and focus on turning Canada into the builders of the future  through _education_ OR to have a kick-ass plan for a guaranteed minimum income to balance our society. The United States is already seeing the imbalance between the educated who have opportunities vs. the uneducated who had opportunities and it's rearing it's terrible head in Canada as well. People call it populism  I call it a failure to retrain.  Anyone that thinks lifelong learning is not the key to a successful future is destined for poverty unless they already own or have access to a significant amount of capital.,?
55,The anti-American pile of Theocracy Republican extremists does not know why he's buying Russian boy followers on Twitter  huh. Funny  most Christian republican traitors KNOW when they're committing treason. I guess this Christian Republican white supremacist pile of Republican is too stupid to know he's buying Russian bot followers.,?
56,Ridiculous! There's a steady camp right at the 6th street off ramp from Ferry St. that has a garbage can RIGHT NEXT to the drunks. They refuse to use it simply because they don't care and there's nothing we can do to make them pick it up. Peddle your snake oil somewhere else...,?
57,You a former reporter? LOL! For who?,?
58,I would have included Lisa Raitt in the list of worthy candidates.  Strategically a better chance of capturing Liberal seats in the Maritimes and T.O. and Van burbs.  She can match the other CPC candidates on fiscal policy and may even beat Trudeau at parts of his own game  including legalizing marijuana and enough empathy to appeal to segments of Trudeau supporters.,?
59,That was a "typo?" Stupid me.  Hard to tell since you make so many stupid remarks.,?
60,F & G should do away with dipnetting.,?
61,Yep straight shooting himself in the foot.,?
62,He's just another opportunist who has heard that Canada likes to give away millions to terrorists and dual citizens who are stupid enough to travel to countries which actively imprison and torture people. Well  he's  not a Canadian citizen or even a permanent resident so he has no claim to any Canadian taxpayer cash. Just say no to him and stop any more claims.,?
63,No matte what he says  or how he says it  I find it hard to imagine how anyone finds this moron funny.,?
64,Kneel all you want; I won't be watching.  And also Donna  you are a racist.,?
65,Yes   and someone should tweet this news to Mr. Trump  on the offhand that he may tweet back...,?
66,Why be a punching bag for the country's losers and political lowlifes? These jerks are still crowing about a win accomplished through the most egregious lying in any American political campaign in history and massive assistance from a hostile foreign power. As Bill Maher points out  we'll quit calling them stupid when they quit doing and saying stupid things.,?
67,My point is: that is why his boneheaded tweet didn't say Foreign Born Driver or any other country-only Japanese.  Thin-skinned we sure are anymore.  Honestly-dumb thing to tweet  stupid thing to tweet  but worth a loss of job or calling it racist? Ludicrous.,?

78,It seems that the entire village is corrupt.,?
79,Senator  Dan Sullivan (R-Ohio).,?
80,fluffy  It is the difference between dividend growth and dividend.   TD is dividend growth. (Growing dividends eventually drive up stock price resulting in higher dividend payments and capital appreciation)  HOT.UN is dividend. (Purchased for a stable above average yield  but not much capital appreciation is expected)  Full disclosure  I own both equities mentioned.,?
81,It is not about leveling the playing field as police officers make a whole lot more money than lifeguards. Further  they do not receive the allowances that police officers receive. The taxpayers will be the ones losing in this. It will be the attorneys winning big paydays. You see  lifeguards are more at risk of negative outcomes given that accidents are likely to happen to those who play in our beaches. They are responsible for rescuing beach goers without the numbers and or resources that our other first responders have.,?
82,only commie  assholes have rights ....isn't that so mr. blitzer?,?
83,The rise in anti-islamic sentiment is a reflection of the rise of radical islam within the Islamic community.   People see that dozens of young Canadian muslims are going to Syria to join ISIS.   They see massive "no go zones" in European countries and a rise of home grown attacks there.   Then you have the audacity to call the resulting backlash again Islam immigration a phobia?          The best way for Canadian Muslims to combat Islamophobia is to moderate Islam in Canada and drive out hate filled Imans  and change some of the  anti-Woman/ sit at the back mosques that Premier Wynne likes to go to.  To paraphrase the Liberal Dutch PM Rutte  "Act normal".    Most muslims are moderate and fantastic Canadians.  It is time for them to take out the trash and fix up their own communities.,?
84,If I have to heard that stupid APD Union and Berki claim that more cops equates to less crime  I might just explode. We have more cops and now we have more crime. What tards.,?
85,You're a troll faking someone else's account. Get out.,?
86,Trump simply does not care. "I am president  and to hell with all of you".,?
87,Disloyalty to who.Herr Trump.  The man is a moron and anyone that can't still stand up for him isn't too bright either.,?
88,Oh  a crime has been committed. The perpetrators from the Trump campaign just haven't been indicted . . . yet.,?
89,Most murder suicides including children are committed by white people. What is your point? We know you couldn't care less about black lives. We also know you helped white racists elect Trump. That makes you a collaborator with white racists  if you are not one yourself. The name Quisling is appropriate for you  in regards to equal rights for all.,?
90,You  are a fuc*** dead man McGee.,?
91,Stupid people doing stupid things  still doesn't mean that no one should own firearms. This sounds like a party of goobers who should have had supervision if they wanted to play with scissors. I hope that woman heals (I'll pray)  what a BIG stooopid thing! Dancing with a gun you stupid tard? Why???!,?
92,Teddy Roosevelt would kick that fat pompous orange haired fraud from here to tomorrow if he were alive today.,?
93,get some help for your hate and stupidity,?
94,Wasn't Tom Price one of Trump's little brown-nosers in that retch-inducing kowtow by Stalin's Polit  I mean Trump's cabinet?   To think that any of those self-neutered fools--General Mattis excepted--would spew something other than the Trump line shows spectacular naïveté.,?
95,Be Prepared  their moto  they were  when in doubt appuland.  Only a fool would think they understood  oh I forgot the fool was speaking.  Care to Trump that.,?
96,I think the federal prosecutors have been drinking too much caffeine. IF the robbery was for a shipment of beans then they may have a point. They have no case for interstate prosecution for a product already delivered to  a business. Lets add nuts to those coffee beans.,?
97,I don't think the feds should jail these morons  but a whale going up a fresh water is pretty much dead,?
98,I would not classify Denver's QBs as below average.  Why not wait until we see them play this year until branding them "below average"?  Siemian actually had a good first starting year  better than most I've seen lately. Considering he played injured  had no O-line  didn't have a run game  or TE receiving support  I think he did pretty well.   Hopefully this year will be entirely different. The O-line looks like it could be improved (hard to say until they play the games)  the running back stable has definitely improved  field position should be improved with rookie speedster returning kicks / punts  receiving corps has been enhanced with potential slot receiver   and McCoy will be using more shotgun which always helps the QB.   My bet is that the offense and QB surprise everyone this year. Defense will remain top in the league and Denver will be a play-off contender.   But until they play the games everything is just talk and speculation. Might as well be positive rather than negative,?
99,First  I don't consider him a troll. As you and others have pointed out  the definition of troll is NOT "someone I disagree with."    I up vote him because I agree with many of the points he makes and like that he makes them with a sharp wit.  He points out the Church's faults  (and that's a good thing)   while you refuse to see that it has any.,?
100,Here come the climate change deniers. Neanderthals yearning for simpler times where no one was forced to endure the torture of third grade spelling tests or living in a world where some assholes went to college.,?
101,Apartments in places like Stockholm are huge with high ceilings  very quiet and surrounded by trees and clean water even right near the city's centre.    They have character.  Your elevator is probably going to be old-fashioned  but there aren't a lot of buildings where people need to climb more than three stories.,?
102,Enough already  don't you remember that fools gave you a PM's job  do it.,?
103,Not really. The V&A is a private company  and they convinced a lot of people to invest.   The concern is not so much centered on the building and its construction  but the involvement of Zeitz. He gets naming rights for a mere R20m (alleged to be the value of his collection) purchased from a select few galleries  with everybody else desperately changing their profiles to suit his buying pattern.   Im not surprised by the admission fees  and by European standards it quite low. It's a private museum after all. Anyway  if you're over sixty  you can get pensioners membership for R180 per year  giving you access any day if the week  and other perks too.,?
104,Yeah those clowns in black masks acting violent again.,?

106,This statistic 'shocked' you?  Well  after affirmative action  inflated scores on SAT tests  quotas for enrollment  for all of these groups  what did you really expect?  Are you that stupid yourselves?  Probably.  Liberal numbskulls.,?
107,Trump just employs racists and bigots. He doesn't care enough to have an organized racist ideology. He just doesn't respect anyone but himself.,?
108,amazing 20 yr olds that are protesting air...............idiots who protest cause the got nothing better to do......,?
109,You liberals are all the same.  You self righteous bastards. How dare you talk to us about being far right? Keep yapping.

110,The Putin and Trump trolls are all here tonight,?
111,Might it make sense for the university to start collecting job placement data on all their graduates and use this data to influence which programs are reduced or cut? Anyone whom helps to support and fund the university (students  parents  state and federal govt  industry  foundations  etc...) deserves to know what percent of students  enrolled in a program  have been hired into a living wage job  in the area they trained for.    Shouldn't job placement data  in a student's training area  be just as important (if not more) as degree completion? The universities "customers " should be confident that they are investing in an education that results in a living wage job vs huge debt.   Many postsecondary institutions collect this data.  H0w about giving institutions that train for "HIRE" education priority when it comes to state funding?,?
112,Who is this movie made for? Movies like this are made for international audiences  mainly China. Same as the recent terrible movie The Mummy. Producers and film makers of these types of movies do not care at all about the North American box office. The box office is global now. Producers know these movies are garbage. But international audiences eat them up. "Let them eat cake!",?
113,A lot of drivers think nothing of pulling out in front of these trucks and cut them off all the time.  The driver may have been trying to  avoid killing some idiot driver. A moose  bear or even a dog could have ran across the road. Don't be judging the driver from the comfort of your computer or cell phone. A lot of things could have caused this accident. My condolences to the family and friend of this person and may he rest in peace.,?

132,Maybe your daughter and you should try harder. Trying to compare your sad story to those who've literally been bombed out their country? Pathetic.

134,Trump is acting more and more like a despot-wannabe....or a spoiled rotten six-year-old  stomping his feet when he doesn't get his way.  In the meantime  cowardly republican congressmen continue to allow this ridiculous spectacle.  I guess they will go along with anything he wants so long as they can use him to achieve their goals.  Unfortunately  they don't know how to wield their power for the good of the people.,?

137,I would think that companies offer a 2-5% discount on DRIPs to offer an incentive to shareholders to keep reinvesting their capital with the company.  It really is that simple.  It also means less paperwork for the company as they don't have to issue payments every month/quarter.   For the record  like Sandia  I don't DRIP.,?

Nice to have is good if you don't have to pay for it or use other people's money to make you feel good.  Reality is different.  This is just another shot by the union to continue their fight about privatization.  Note the statement "The only reason (the hospital staff) could tell us it increased … was because of the Kaiser takeover ”,?
150,I haven't seen any practice this year and I couldn't see him in preseason as he is injured  but what has Booker done to be RB2? This has been bothering me ever since VJ said that Booker is #2. Based on what? Last year performance? He was bad RB last year  his avg per carry was what 3 yds? Our O line was bad last year  but even with that line CJ was able to run  not great but run  while Booker couldn't do anything. What did he do on practice this year that I've missed? From what I've seen in preseason Charles should be #2 if not #1 RB then Henderson #3 and only then maybe Booker.,?

156,I have been receiving Veterans Administration Health Care for over 30 years and have nothing but wonderful things to say about the care I have received. This is not simple care either. One being brain surgery at the Durham VA Hospital and many other smaller procedures at facilities in Albany  NY and in SW Florida  i.e. Bay Pines  Tampa  Lee County). I have an extensive list of complicated issues (spinal cord injury  head trauma  seizure disorder) and I feel very fortunate in the care that I have received for all my disabilities. I truly appreciate the services that I have been afforded by the Veterans Administration and have nothing but respect for all of my care- providers. I am my own best advocate and am well educated on my various conditions and feel that this can only help in assisting my providers.,?
157,BTW:  I'm guessing you're familiar with State laws relating to personnel issues  including the requirements for confidentiality and the exemption from Public Records requirements.  As I view that "investigative report"  it was a core component of the displimary process relating to Ms Shurtz's actions and  therefore  should be released to the public ONLY if she gave specific written approval for its release.  Based on all accounts I've read  she did NOT give such approval.  Yet  the University Administration released the report and supplied it to  among I'd guess others  the Register-Guard.    I view that action as an effort  IMO likely an "illegal" effort  to garner public support for the comments already made by University Administrators and support for any future punitive actions the Administration might take.    IMO  that release (again  based on my understanding that Ms Shurtz did NOT authorize it) may subject the University to serious legal repercussions.  regards  Gary,?

160,Tax returns are not extremely revealing. They don’t  for instance. reveal net worth.   Donald Trump told you why he isn’t releasing them. What is your evil mind conjuring up?  Are you aware that your (D) candidate Hillary Clinton and her husband Bill deducted $1 042 000 in charitable contributions last year — $1 million of which went to their own family non-profit  the Clinton Family Foundation?  Why aren’t you jumping her bones? If Trump had done that you and the libwinger media would be on it like Old Yeller on raw hamburger. You’re just another partisan hypocrite hack.,?

167,Eagleclaw  what are you plans when the Donald loses?,?
168,What a crap post as none of Harper's emails have reference implicating him in the payback and coverup that was being done within the PMO and Senate committee.  What you and so many others are trying to do is implicate him in orchestrating the whole affair which he wasn't part of. That part of your post itself is a lie.  The closest email implying Harper's knowledge comes from Nigel Wright:  “PM knows  in broad terms only  that I personally assisted Duffy when I was getting him to agree to repay.”   How vague is "broad terms"?   Harper didn't orchestrate the payback as that was dealt within the PMO.  He was truthful about when he knew what took place and admits blowing a gasket when he finally learned about how the payback was made and the coverup within the PMO.  Oh  the horror of Conservatives paying back taxpayer's money ASAP that was claimed by Duffy because of very unclear guidelines that all Lib and Con senators were eventually absolved.  Stick to the guy who's being investigated.,?
169,I listened and watched the video to the Congresswoman's speech  and the best that can be said is that Kelly incorrectly described what she said. Actually  she sounded more presidential than does Kelly's boss. As to the propriety of questioning the word of a general  or any officer  or any retired officer  Gen. Petraeus got it right. Don't take my word for it  check out his statement. We have been sort of sold on the notion that the retired "generals" serving the WH right now are our best defense against an ill-conceived nuclear trigger pull. That they will be the cool-heads who prevail if someone goes totally off the rails. I think  that if a handful of retired old guys is our protection against a real stupid act  then our nation is in real big trouble. It is really time for republicans to look themselves in the mirror and to ask themselves just how much longer are they going to allow this spectacle to continue. And  Bernie lovers  this situation is the result of a split ticket.,?

176,The union as part of its demand should consider demanding that the county reduce its use of paid consultants which cost about 35 times the amount of the wages paid to county employees who were hired to do many of the jobs consultants are paid to do. Reduction of commission from 5 to 3 would do wonders for efficiency. Can't 3 hire consultants as well as 5? Reminder to those prepared to walk a picket line. While your paid union reps spews out the usual pro union tripe through a megaphone while collecting a full paycheck you on the line are losing money no raise can cover for years if ever. Your union should have been working with county for ways to cut waste such as hiring  consultants for almost everything. Do something to attract positive public support. From what I see the union did nothing but make their demands expecting the county to magically come up with 25 million dollars. Maybe now would be a good time to work on changing public opinion hold your excessive demands for next tim,?

But you're a "so-called" Journalist when you're nothing more than a propagandist. America helped get her where she ended up. Yes  she put in her effort and talent  but she didn't pay for all she got that supported that effort she put forward. We have few demands. Even our hope that she does her best  is just that "hope"  not a demand. If we demand that those that claim to represent this country carry that responsibility to heart  they would show respect which includes simple stuff such as behaving and remaining within the law of the host country and not wreck bathrooms  but also to please show honor and respect during all duties and ceremonies. If that's too much  then the work she put into it WILL be overshadowed her stupidity as well those that chose to vandalize and lie about it.,?

243,James Comey is a standup guy who took flack from both sides during the Hillary Clinton investigation and now from Trump supporters while the FBI looking into possible illegal collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian intelligence and other agencies. I think it important he be called as a witness by the Senate committee investigating this. It is vital that any replacement as Director be as an independent an actor as Comey was. Pres. Trump apparently does not understand that the FBI works to enforce the law for the people not for his political or legal well being  as so many Hillary supporters in Congress misunderstood this role last year..,?

250,He is most effective at attracting media attention. As for his legislative efficacy  that is debatable. While I completely support restoring the PFD for the economic value it generates  the lawsuit is 90% political cover for the fact he was in the majority when the 6 largest budgets in Alaska's history were passed. This gross overspending is what got us here  and he's expert at distracting from the real issues  such as the coming $4.5 billion deficit and out of control crime in our neighborhoods. Find out  if you can  how he plans to stop the fiscal nosedive. Even if he loses the $667 million PFD battle and we renege on our tax incentives of $700 (unpaid from the last 2 years)  we're still looking at more than a $3 billion shortfall. This is a math problem compounded by partisan politicians like Bill who will refuse to put the most expensive items on the table  like education  healthcare  union contracts  etc. Next comes taxes.,?

There are many things which are not right in the world  this country and this State  but like Mr. Spock says  "the good of the many versus the good of the few." The State of Hawaii should use their money where it does the most good.  In this case they are fighting windmills  because this order will go through.  It is just the Democrat obstruction movement which is the cause of this waste of money.  And where are the other States which sued last time?  Maybe they have  common sense and are more realistic.,?
258,RNC chief strategist Sean Spicer has come out swinging against charges of plagiarism. “Melania Trump said: ‘The strength of your dreams and willingness to work for them.’ Twilight Sparkle from “My Little Pony” said: ‘This is your dream. Anything you can do in your dreams you can do now.’ ”  Why not just say it was a minor mistake and move on? The Twilight Sparkle example is idiotic.  Did Trump mastermind all this?

262,"Eliminate corporate income tax! They're a pass through  paid by customers. Need $s for taxes  raise prices. Congress uses this sleight-of-hand to fool the public." . That old chestnut doesn't really fool much of anyone anymore. The corporations are already charging as much as the market will bear for their products and services. And if the market lets them raise prices  they will do so without needing that excuse. The notion that they will somehow just raise prices (and get away with it) to make up for the tax increase is a violation of the fundamental principles of market economics. It doesn't work that way and it never has.,?

265,I have used Alaska's Campgrounds for decades  best in the nation. The best  do  have some sites for "reservations" and some for the "drop in". which are generally more spaces. Now the campgrounds near the popular spots are a different deal of course My advice is simple  many campers leave the campground not as early as one may think.In fact many sleep in late. Then eat breakfast that is closer to lunch. I have found myself having the campground to myself in the early am and often on a lake or river fishing by myself. The best time to check for a camp spot is not after dinner or bedtime  although that is a popular time with travelers. When camping at a popular campground campers leave around noon so if you think that would suit your plans to me that is the best time to get a camp spot.,?

268,"with exceptions such as redneck regions of America"  What an arrogant elitist hateful piece of liberal shit you are.

269,Ms Schrader  I attended Cory Gardner's town hall in Lakewood yesterday.That meeting started off poorly due to loud shouting coming from some of the audience that actually drowned out both the voices of the persons asking questions and Gardner.Those people were in the minority and the worst offenders were escorted out of the meeting.The rest of the town hall proceeded mostly without any more obnoxious interruptions.Most people attending expressed our agreements with applause and thumbs up signs and our disagreements with boos and thumbs down signs while some people still loudly voiced their opinions  mostly contrary  to what Sen. Gardner replied.  I would say that all of what happened after the offending people were removed should be expected at a town hall meeting with a Republican senator in this day and time.  I completely disagree with you about feeling sorry for Gardner.You say that he is trying to get out of a GOP-built box. He is a primary builder of that box! No tears for Cory!,?
270,Before you MAGAphants make even bigger fools of yourself  I suggest you READ the indictments.  I know there are a lot of big words in there  but you will also see that a lot of the nonsense that you have been passing on from Fox News  etc  is completely wrong.    Before you keep saying that Papadopoulos is an insignificant "volunteer"  you should read what he pleaded guilty to and what he stipulated was true in his indictment. Just read it yourself if you have the courage and see for yourself.,?

277,"why is there a news blackout on reporting this?"  There's no blackout  Barb. I haven't seen it firsthand but I'm sure Bakken crude continues to rumble through Lac Megantic. There was talk of moving the line away from the downtown core but I don't know if that's been done.  MMA went broke after the 2103 inferno and was bought by Central Maine & Quebec Railway. Their website says they've been operating since 2104 and that their "primary cargoes include... energy products.",?

279,Enough of your thoughtful BS.  Oh  so now you try to rationalize your homophobic  racists  misogynistic comments since your hero  the baby-in-chief was elected. You have no understanding of the history of the confederacy and its racist origins.  You need to take a good look  because Fox News  Trump  the alt-right depend on stupid lapdog MAGAphants like you to keep perpetuating the myths.  Just like the confederacy had to have its own lapdogs believing that secession was about states rights  and not the southern oligarchs' need for slavery to maintain their money and their power.  I'm sure you think your comment is measured  but it's pathetic and racist like you.  Don't give me BS about a multi cultural family  you are from the same white cloth that was standing behind Trump in West Virginia.  TIME FOR YOU AND ALL THE OTHER WHITE SUPREMIST MAGAPHANTS TO OWN WHAT HAPPENED TODAY.,?
280,The Republicans cannot continue to enable Trump and allow his brazen ignorance and petty egoism to put people at risk. At a certain point  the good of the country and possibly the rest of the world must take precedence.,?

283,And do you define "solid proof'? Outside of mathematics and physics (correct me if there are others) you can never have definitive 'proof' of anything.  You can have evidence and in this case there seems to be many converging threads of evidence. The question is  why is all this evidence appearing in the political discourse now? Some people think that it's because Obama's a sore loser  or the intelligence communities want to embarass Trump  or they are simply inept.   My theory is simpler. There is evidence because the attempt to influence the election was real and the dividends the Russians will accrue as a result are considerable. They aren't stupid.,?
284,I thought Trump was so smart  and he hired smart people?  No wonder he's declared bankruptcy six times!  He's a total incompetent.,?
285,lol  no you wouldn't. you'd go broke. and rightfully so.,?
286,I work in the private sector and I've travelled to a lot of countries and have been to a lot of conferences and events paid for by my employer.  So  then  what's your point?

292,If trump doesn't want to be "miscomprehended " he should shut his mouth  since most of what comes out of it is incomprehensible garbage.  Besides  the issue here is his apparent belief that being potus is the same as being king.

And what about the bird he was shooting at  what was the problem then?,?
295,Takes the last paragraphs to reveal the real ideology of the author - Just another Republican Terrorist Traitor demanding fundamentalist christianity ruling over all secular government and the usual federal government hater which  in itself  is traitorous to the nation.  Blind Republican ideologues caring for no one except themselves as they feed and have fed at the government trough for their whole lives.  Blind Republican ideologues failing to understand that the government spending has sustained the national economy since the Great Depression.  Of course  they don't count all of that military spending as really "government".  When these traitors finish  the economy will be right back to Depression days and  this time  the citizens will rise up in armed revolt against all of these traitors.  Disgusting.,?

While you're figuring that one out  could you tell us all again how someone declaring that they won't be apart of something is tantamount with them being apart of something?  If I tell 12 Million Justin Bieber fans I don't want to be apart of that  I have now just made myself a "Belieber?"  Please- tell us how you're getting that  again.,?

312,http://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/resources/criminal-defense/misdemeanor-offense/alaska-public-intoxication-laws-drunk-public  Alaska has largely decriminalized public intoxication as a go-alone criminal offense.  This and the resulting openness of the chronic inebriate problem on the streets  parks and greenbelts may explain the perception of some that we have a unique problem.  Rather  I think other cities do a far more efficient job of pushing and concentrating the problem from working folk.  Some may argue that openness allows social welfare solutions  others that it contributes to a sub-culture and serves as a magnet.    To share an anecdote  I was recently hit up for contributions from a man and his father from Selawik  some 500 flying miles and $757 flying dollars from Anchorage.  I have to wonder if a large proportion of the "transient population" is not homeless generally  but rather homeless in Anchorage.  Greater coordination with Native and Village Corporations in order?,?

315,The Truth be told  the time to voice opinions  concerns have passed.  I hear so much how people do not read the paper  listen to the news  nothing good to be read or heard.  If you don't read the paper  don't listen to the news  don't tell me someone keeps you informed  for they must read the paper or listen to the news.  Too late now  maybe being informed is not a bad thing.  What the old saying "Take the Good with the Bad.",?

318,Bruce Anderson (DLNR) is a career "scientist" who promulgates studies and discussion ad nauseum to protect commercial interests. The DLNR and Ige administration is infested with politicans who put self-interest first. Revealing a plan for Uhu limits in the near future is more lip service from an administration that's been bogged down commercial interests. Governor Ige and DLNR had a golden opportunity to get behind SB 1240 in the 2017 legislative year to stop aquarium collecting permitting  but Suzanne Case was one of the first to submit lengthy testimony in opposition  and Governor Ige flat out vetoed the bill despite majority support from the House and Senate. "Ultimately  Anderson said  the best management strategy is reestablishing and maintaining healthy reefs that have substantial herbivorous fish populations to keep the algae down." Bruce Anderson and DLNR continue to let the aquarium trade run rampant when the solution is simple: stop wildlife extraction for reef recovery.,?

Did it occur to you that these people are p'd because their mothers were called b**hes by their so-called leader? That the one sworn to uphold the constitution is telling American citizens when  if  and how they can exercise their constitutional rights? - telling private corporations to fire employees -which is illegal under U.S. law - because they choose to exercise their rights in a way that is inconvenient to the priviledged class.   Yeah  the democrats are making this all about him. (smirk).,?

330,214Montreal  you are correct. in fact Trump said the KKK and white suprecist are repugnant and there is no place for them in America is the words he used.

334,Anti-government sentiment has reached a dangerous level.  Our Republic based upon democratically elected representatives has stopped working and is especially un-willing to debate in public the important issues at hand.  The system has be re-rigged & the deck stacked by extreme computer assisted gerrymandering to serve corporate special interest bottom line thinking  there are decisions made in closed caucuses and more loyalty shown to groups like ALEC and non-residents like the Koch brothers & Karl Rove than to those to whom "Oaths of Office" were sworn.    The House & Senate were set up to be an open forum for ongoing public debate of the serious issues with compromises struck & votes taken  but when decisions are made in secret and committee chairs can lock up Bills or just wait until the session limit clock votes with a resounding NO  we lose!    Patience & due diligence have their place but silence & gridlock the very breaking of the government could cost all of us our Rights!,?

I suppose if the first lady had sent science books  this pretentious idiot would be recommending books on string theory and quantum physics. What she really wanted was to show her peers just how clever and sensitive she is  and try and embarrass someone who was trying to do a decent thing.

344,How blind are you people accusing Trump for what he says and does  Look back on how Hitler became into power  Just like most dictators like the North Korean ass  And not anyone is or was willing in the past to stand up to him  The only problem also lies in the fact the asses who were in power prior to all this mess let and used China to become another ungodly mess. Entrepreneurs of disgust  all of you are to blame ! Come on you brilliant minds who are willing to rant and rave to say talks will solve this  Your heads are full of dung  Not one communist dictator will ever follow what is called Gods way  For the way of God is love  NOT DICTATORSHIP  and you that is all of you have thrown gods laws out with the baby in the tub !

363,Its a damn shame that people resort to bashing a man who is genuinely trying to do the right thing for our country and her citizens because they can't handle or control him. It just pisses them off that Trump won't play the puppet and is strong and relentless in getting things done his way. I'm sure they also realize that President Trumps fantastic work ethic and determination makes theirs look inadequate and incompetent. Keep doing what you're doing Mr. President.

384,I really don't understand the last paragraph of this article. Paid parking lots offering "free" spots to employees IS a taxable benefit. No one pays for parking in a mall lot  so how should that be a taxable benefit to an employee?  My understanding is that any "gift" given to an employee that has a value of over $100 is deemed a taxable benefit. A company car is a perfect example. Parking in an area where usually you have to pay is another. The rules have not changed  just the fact that CRA wants to nickel and dime the poorest workers now too.,?

The embassies of these countries do not have large immigration sections. In a way  those risking their lives to cross the Mediterranean have no dignified alternative. No other way to apply.."

410,Shut up and pay your taxes.,?
411,It's a conspiracy!!!,?
412,Exactly. This article is worried about some big houses while the rail ruined two major arteries through Waipahu and Pearl City and is about to ruin a third in Kalihi. Why? All for the massive developments that are lined up along the way. Tens of thousands of new residents added to the island with virtually no improvement to infrastructure. While folks are rising up about the rail  the government officials have swung the door open wide to mega development that would never have been approved had the voting public's attention had not been diverted. Funny to read the concern over a few large houses.,?
413,I’m sorry for your loss  however gun control is not the answer. We as Americans have a constitutional right granted in the 2nd amendment. While many of today’s firearms didn’t exist at the time niether did the computers  or the internet  that is being used to provide you a platform to exercise your first amendment right. The constitution was written to stand the test of time and to protect citizens like you and me from over reaching governments or people’s knee jerk reactions. You want to blame the guns  but not the evil behind them? After 9/11 there was no call to ban planes. Your answer is to make the law abiding citizens defenseless? You want to take away my ability to defend my family? You want my daughters to be victims? Shame on you for using your tragedy to push your personal agenda and beliefs on me.,?
414,Harper ran deficits during the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression and than  only when forced to by the Liberals who wanted him to borrow and spend MORE and threatened to topple the minority conservatives if they didn't.  Trudeau is doing it AFTER the budget was already balanced in order to buy votes and during an improving financial picture. Stupid stupid stupid!!!,?
415,I said I know them.  I didn't say they were my friends.  If your cousin was a ""higher up" dimwit who despised what was going on to the very end"  why didn't he do something about it?   Knowing something bad is happening  having the power to do something about it  and NOT doing anything is being part of the problem.  Like you say  your cousin is a dimwit - must run in the family.,?
416,And  for a couple of months each year  you might see the 'car hop' scoot out on ice skates :),?
417,You bet! Calling everyone out in public will REALLY make these guys straighten up their act! Bunch of slackers!!,?
418,"Wicked Wynee" and "stupid" ... hmm is this a reasoned response?  The 'stupid' is if the PCO thinks they can win by denigrating Wynee and not offering a positive viable alternative. Unfortunately for the PCO the voters aren't stupid.,?
419,Wow. Clueless or willfully misinformed. Which is it?,?
420,Everybody that doesn't drink the kool aid is a racist right?  At least half the USA and I guess a solid 40% of Canada are rock solid racist immoral deplorable scum right? I agree friend. I celebrate it now!! I vote conservatively  am white  think CNN is a disgrace.....I'm a racist!!  The smears aren't working. The left is terrified. That's why they are winking at the blackshirt fascist antifas. Which just exposes their moral bankruptcy. Don't stand with them friend.,?
421,Not an unusual story  sad to say. Worked with palliative care groups during the AIDS epidemic. Many  many young men died alone- disowned by their families.,?
422,Silly Simon. Only observant Muslims are martyrs. Everyone else is a dhimmi. The louts of the Lutton rape gangs made this quite clear.,?

428,Now it is "Agent Orange"? That is funny! I can hardly wait to see the next Our President Trump coined 'name'! Merciful heavens  we sure have run the gamut!,?
429,Lies   dont believe a word  MGM  the mob got this. S. Paddock's brother is a liar also.,?
430,I was wondering what could have possibly motivated the DP editorial staff to pen something that borders on criticizing Denver's homeless army and by implication the Hancock Administration whose policies have allowed this problem to fester and grow. Then I saw that one of the editorial page folks is married to someone connected with the Library. The homeless army is no problem when it is standing on every street corner in town  urinating and defecating on lawns and alleys  rummaging through trash cans  sleeping in store entrances and accosting tourists downtown - but let them turn the library into their daytime shooting gallery and it is time for action!   Denver has made itself a magnet for the homeless - many of whom are professional drifters. The City has allowed many organizations to build shelters and food kitchens in the heart of downtown. It is time to stand up to the ACLU which is far more concerned with the rights of the homeless than those of honest taxpayers.,?
431,What a bunch of disgusting thugs. Their candidate didn't win so they are going to destroy the Capital.,?
432,And it's the same science which predicted the eclipse down to the second.  What's your point?,?

437,Canada is the number one destination. Free everything  and the only place on the planet where you get to have dual citizenship.  Thank-you to the small number of taxpayers who are actually stupid enough to pay tax.,?
438,please explain why any one with common sense would even acknowledge cnn as a news network..during the campaign it was a 24 hour commercial for hillary.  most biased reporting i have ever witnessed.  as a former liberal canadian who moved to los angeles 25 hears ago  the liberal left led by nancy (we'll read it after we pass it) pelosi and obama (you can keep your doctor) have converted muself and a lot of my friends to become republicans.  to get a true picture of how liberals behave google the citly of los angeles vs the aclu re side walk repairs.  the americans with disabilities had to have the aclu file a law suit against the city of los angeles to have the side walks repaired as they have become impassable for people in wheelchairs or crutches.  the city opposed the suit  lost  appealed and lost again.  the judge ordered the city to comply with its own laws.  this will cost the citizens of la 2 billion dollars.  la la land  the liberal capital of the world..hypocrite's of the world,?
439,I will quote the oldie but goodie  "too little  too late".,?
440,What a bunch of idiots.  Lock 'em up and throw way the key.  Oh  I'm sorry  they're doing their Christmas shopping.  Shame on me!  Black killing black is ok but another nationality killing a black is not ok?  Check the Chicago stats....out numbers any thing else you're come across.  Funny  I don't see them rioting over that.  Just an excuse to cause more trouble.,?
441,Most idiotic  heartless comment I think I've ever read.     You need help.,?

447,OK............. then require to show the damn thing to vote  nation wide!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,?
448,He was not a child soldier to begin with  child soldiers are young kids who have been kidnapped by terrorists and trained to kill.  Khadr  was a canadian citizen who wasn't kidnapped and brought over there by his father to do nothing more than Kill.  he's not owed a god damn cent nor an apology.  Now that this dim witted justice system that is in place in this country has decided that he should receive $10 million dollars  where do you suppose those funds will end up! ya no doubt at all financing more terrorists   good job you idiots!!!,?

452,Stetson proves the veracity of my comment as she seeks and finds the a propagandist willing to completely invert the basic meanings of every world.  Liberal and fascist are diametrically opposed in any true dictionary  but mixing them together allows the fascists to transfer their violence and hatred onto all of those who oppose their demands for power.  Mussolini  Hitler  and now Trump are the pure white examples of fascism without any liberality other than the liberal dispensing of hate and violence.  Stetson quotes a source so devoid of intelligence or reason and completely amoral and ultimately stupid.,?
453,We have gone from Kenyan to Russian. And the Russian guy Trump is inept and corrupt in office. No legislative leadership in passing bills so far. Nepotism. And completely selfish. He wastes a lot of time golfing at taxpayer expense on his private residences. Trump makes outlandish claims about how great he is. It is unfortunate since he is a liar.,?
454,Good point... We should go one step further and eliminate all religious symbology from society...,?
455,JUSTIN  after reading this story  I started to realize that  I  AM  NOT the only one who has noticed  the truth in what you say. Have you  ever NOTICED  that the machine ALWAYS SUGGEST  that you keep every PAIR  only to find out that $100.00 or more GOES AWAY fast ???? I  have noticed a few strange situations,?

459,And here come the Russian trolls.  So obvious dude.    And why would anyone fear a second cold war?  Russia is nothing these days - smaller economy than Canada and military that's falling apart.  We have nothing to fear from them at all  there is no reason to bow down to Putin the brute.,?
460,I’ve an alternative idea: embrace science based medicine and drop this mystical  woo-woo  money wasting garbage.,?
461,ChuckT  you are 100% on target with your comments!,?
462,Because they suffer from low IQ.,?
463,There is fault in almost any accident  ranging from being hit by incompetent  drunk  drugged  absent minded and ignorant drivers of all ages  sexes and arrogant attitudes. Non Fault insurance is a sham  as it lumps many times the victim with the at fault drivers. It's a cheap way out for insurances.,?
464,You will discover you lost big time. With a true imbecile as POTUS the US will go to hell in a hand basket.,?
465,I guess it sucks to be you  particularly when you try the to pass the previously ingested bullet.,?
466,I fully support children receiving financial literacy - if for no other reason so that they can avoid settling for having someone else control their financial future.  The combined GIS /  CPP / OAS as is more than sufficient to provide baseline financial support.  Enhanced mandatory CPP is nothing more than legislating greater reliance of of the work on the government for their financial welfare.  Taking even more money out of my pocket that will generate inferior returns that will negatively impact my retirement finances is not an option.  I have no problem if others want to contribute extra to an optional modified CPP program that results in an enhanced payout.  The solution should be about educating citizens so that they can make superior financial decisions for themselves not taking those decisions away.,?
467,' Good points  Chief  …in the first paragraph.  The second?  Not so good   ...you've aligned yourself with Walker who wishes to continue to allow wasting tens and tens of billions on the ruinous and worthless mega-projects that aren't likely to return any value to Alaskans.  Walker wants to continue with a irresponsible policy of increasing and creating new forms of corporate welfare.  Before you ask the public to pay for the mistakes of the Republican majority  rake back those millions upon millions being siphoned off for corporate frivolity  I remain astonished that more than a few of my fellow Alaskans can blindly accept that the answer to our budget problems is to just give more of our money to the people who are squandering it in programs which only benefit corporations.  Tell me again why we're gifting 20 billion dollars to the most profitable corporations in the world?  And you think we should line up  open our pockets and ask them to take what little we have left and more?  No.,?
468,Sounds like the racist liberal got what was coming to him. Too bad.,?
469,Even if free trade is tanked with the USA  there will need to be some accommodation for unrestricted trade between the NAFTA partners in the Auto  energy and information/ service sectors as they are so interlinked they cannot be disrupted without catastrophic results. Congress knows this. So does Trump. Ending NAFTA will not end trade but will make trade more difficult. The US needs access to Mexican and Canadian markets to support thier Agriculture sector and vice versa.  Trade will continue without NAFTA but tarriffs will raise prices. TIPP will replace the US for a large portion of Canada’s resources and agriculture products. An agreement with China will also absorb some of the slot trade. CETA will also help. I do not believe the doom and gloom. Will we be worse off? Yes in the short term but we may be better off in the long term as we will not be as vulnerable to US policy changes.,?
470,Having watched the debate.... The true face of extremism and populism was revealed: ignorant  cynical  bully  lying  hypocritical. Exceedingly dangerous.,?
471,There was NEVER and "Russian Hacking" or even influence of our elections. This is ONE HUGE FALSE NARRATIVE created by SORE LOSERS in the evil Democrat (Fascist) Party.   These SCUM want a Civil War. Maybe we should give them one???,?
472,These people who do these things of destruction are cowards. They need to be caught convicted and executed there is no hope for these people. Total scum of the earth. But with all the liberal laws we have in America that will never happen. I really feel bad for the owners of the property.,?
473,Düstin "the moron" Darden can't even spell "floride" let alone understand it.,?
474,You seem to be conflating prophetic and theological functions. Prophetic revelation and remonstration is a message delivery function of the Spirit and you can point to many instances of unlikely vehicles for that  but it is distinct from theological thought and development that is the function of folks like Aquinas and Augustine.,?
475,Funny how last week  after they declared Hillary the CLEAR WINNER over trump  you and your ilk all called the Washington Post "a liberal rag."  Now that is suits your needs  you quote the newspaper  like the HYPOCRITES THAT YOU ARE.  You right wingers are shady shape shifters...,?
476,Yes  the traffic on Kapiolani Blvd by the Marco Polo is screwed with police  fire  EMT vehicles and the  HFD helicopter flying overhead.  Hope no one was seriously hurt in the fire.  The fire was on a high floor so that makes it difficult for the fire fighters.,?
477,"I'm sure the shooter was part of a well regulated militia." -- really?  Which one? .

" Maybe the NRA can send reps to the funerals and hospital rooms to explain " -- really? Why would they need to do that? . "I'm sure it will bring comfort to the grieving." -- well  I'm sure it would go further than sending  say  YOU to comfort them. Your bedside manner doesn't strike me as the best.....,?
478,Not so. We have a regulated  oligopoly here that rips us off. And  Thailand is very nice.,?
479,Boots  Peter   why do you make these blanket assertions that republicans do not care for the poor or middle class? Are you so arrogant and narcissistic as to think that you have all the answers? Keep an open mind.,?

485,If you are so smart name one infrastructure that Trudeau has spent his $25Billion deficit on and tell us how many jobs it has  created.  Harper's deficit was during a depression  there is no depression now  thanks to Harper who left a balanced budget and started to pay off the debt.  Trudeau is not even able to tell Canadians when his deficits will end  he doesn't   know and heaven help us if the world goes into depression again with Trudeau in charge,?

489,I grew up in Michigan and regularly visit family there.  Not all stores in Michigan have nice inside returns.  My family all lives in southern Michigan and I know what they and a lot of their neighbors do.  They buy their soda and beer by the case in Indiana (no deposit) and put the empties in the garbage.  (Bar codes prevent returning Indiana cans in Michigan.),?
490,As one of America's weakest presidents  Obama should give some thought to how he contributed to the demise of the democratic party. It's in a shambles after his abysmal performance. Like Trudeau  Obama was all imagery and little substance. Oh well  he's off making millions spewing more of his views to ignorant audiences..,?
491,The Liberals could have hired Gordon Wilson for $150 000 a year and there would have been no paper trail to get them in trouble later when asked "What did we get for the money?"  As most taxpayer sponsored initiatives indicate-- not a damn thing  again.,?
492,There are racists in every race and culture. I don't care what anyone says  but I have seen it firsthand. It is ugly and stupid and sometimes  dangerous. The root causes come down to fear and jealousy and sometimes outright greed.  Most all people in this country today have no concept of what slavery was. When they speak about it  they can only speak about it in distant terms. They never experienced it. Jim Crow laws? There are still people out there who know what that was like  myself included. I was never subjected to Jim Crow  but I did witness it in action. I watch a young black male child that was my friend get cracked in the head by a cop for using the "Whites Only" water fountain. I was angry about it then and now. That has no place in this society.  Tearing down statues and burning flags is not the solution. Understanding history is. When we do not understand our history  we doom ourselves to repeating it. The Dems like a dumbed down voter  remember that....,?
493,Obstruction  collusion & stupidity.  It's a coming boys.  But first  we must build the wall and have Mexico pay or it  lol.  geev em the shiv  donald  your followers love the back stabbing   lol,?
494,You seem obsessed with whores. Do you have trouble paying women to sleep with you? Can't perform? Is it coming up with the $$ or the fact that it's never enough for them to lower themselves? Or is it some sort of sick Oedipal thing?,?
495,Habs too reliant on Price  those bad losses mid-season when Price was not playing show the weak character of the roster.  Sure the coach was changed but the mindset is still there.,?
496,Spoken like a genuine IDIOT.,?
497,Yep. That's what happens when a comment doesn't meet other users' expectations for civility. Maybe say the same thing again in different words? As muckamuck says  there is sometimes a lag. Time may help  but if not  please try again.,?
498,Yep. It was a dumb question.  It got exactly the answer it deserved.,?
499,Special OPs does dozens of these raids all the time. Should the president be in the situation room for each one? By the way  where was Obama and Hillary when the Benghazi attack was going on late into the night? Can't answer because nobody knows that is willing to talk. Stop being a hypocrite.,?
500,Prayers for his family and friends...,?

509,Yeah  by Muslims committing horrifying acts of mass murder by suicide. I mean  who does that?  Crazy people and Muslim fundamentalists.,?
510,Explain why introducing a process in which donating organs is the default option and refusing such a donation is the option that simply requires an active decision (mark a box) to say no is a dictatorship. Sounds like individual choice to me.,?
511,Troll,?
512,I understand your point of view  as I and many others have felt that way about Presidents Carter (whom I worked to get elected)  Clinton  and Obama  but I accepted that other folks sometimes won.,?
513,I agree. Mindless idiots.,?
514,No ban on Saudi Arabia? The 19 hijackers who did 9/11 were Saudis and probably had help from that regime. If this ban were about security they would put those murderous lunatics at the top of the list.,?
515,What a menagerie of embarrassments they are.  It's worse than having the Beverly Hillbillies move into the White House.,?
516,Trump is pathological liar and psychotic.  He's delusional - making up his own reality.  The sooner this national nightmare is over  the better.,?
517,And then we would wipe them off the map.,?
518,Just imagine  a lying  crooked  corrupt  beech on a broom as the next President.  And to think it's all possible through liberal loons voting for her.  Now isn't that special?  Stop censoring me you assholes!,?

523,So  Murray outplaying Rinne  that shouldn't count?,?
524,What a Dumb idea !,?
525,Louis A. Murphy: Fish are neither conservatives nor liberals. You say  "Demonization of a group will never resolve differences of opinion." As you demonize...well  "the left." Then  without providing one lick of scientific reference  you broadly assert that: "Fish are anatomically incapable of feeling pain. They lack the necessary structural connectivity for the neural processing required for feeling pain. Furthermore  fish do not have emotions and so cannot be humiliated. So by definition  playing a fish cannot be sadism." Well  mostly it's not deliberate sadism...just simple-minded amusement.,?
526,I can't think of a worse manager than John Gibbons as this team slides completely into oblivion-he just sits there-chewing his sunflower seeds-not having a clue what he's doing-no discipline  no ability to shake up the line-up to generate at least some kind of "spark"  NO ANYTHING--Anthropoulos traded away most of this team's future for a few playoff appearances and now the result of this recklessness is apparent--its time to start unloading most of this underachieving/overpaid team for draft picks and start the rebuild--but certainly fire Gibbons as he has no ability whatsoever how to teach/develop the young lineup of the future,?
527,Ridiculous.  Where are you going to go to raise your children?  The USA?  Please.  Your kid is likely to get gunned down in the school yard.  No Thanks.,?
528,Agents are scum.  Let's not loose the lens here.    Aaron is not a victim.  He hasn't been mistreated.  He was given an offer  he rejected it.  So  you get the minimum.  He knew the policy  so HE and Boras left money on the table.  Nice try you lost  bad advice.    It won't make any difference come free agency.   Petty grudges don't serve your clients well.   Who ever pays will get his services.,?
529,Yah  climate change deniers will keep ignoring the obvious despite overwhelming evidence. Pathetic!!,?
530,Of course Trumps attitude on the Accord has not changed ....you can't fix "stupid". If the US is going to use coal and oil full time with no regard for climate  then it is pointless for Canada to worry. We have 37 Million they have 360 million  I think their waste will get to us regardless of what we do.,?
531,Utter nonsense and your singular lack of knowledge on the subject is lamentable.,?
532,Don't blame the media for your own choices and actions.  As for Clinton  put the blame where it belongs: Squarely on the right.  It's common knowledge they've  been harassing and lying about her for years.  How many Benghazi hearings did they hold? 8 or 9? And found exactly nothing. Yet to this day people still believe the bullshit lies about Clinton. Is she perfect? No. Is she the she-demon the right has made her out to be? No. Was she an incalculably better choice for president than the buffoon you probably voted for?  Do I really have to put it down in black and white?,?
533,Do the autobot spammers have to answer 3 questions from the stupid Civil Comments too?,?
534,Trump's an idiot - he thinks Andrew Jackson could have prevented the Civil War!,?
535,As for the first item (knowing what a user has posted previously)  that will come with "following" users  something we are working on now and which should be ready fairly soon.   As for the "published automatically" status: that means you've passed our algorithm's checks (which are based on a combination of several factors) but that your comment has yet to be reviewed by your peers. The peer review algorithm can reverse this fallback algorithm's decision  though (it kicks in when there aren't currently enough reviewers posting comments).  It'd likely be if we helpful added explainers to each comment status  wouldn't it? :),?

538,You don't avoid them by voting for weak and insecure  racist  xenophobe psychotics like Trump.,?
539,Yes  most of them were Occupy Wall Street folks. Communists at their core. Soros funds a lot of it  running it through other organizations that he owns before it get to them. Fairly open and well known.,?
540,silly approach and not in our best interest...,?
541,As a military combat veteran  I would be his guest to watch the game. Please speak for yourself Marine  and let the other veterans​ speak for themselves.,?
542,"A gun nut getting it backwards yet again." You're pretty quick to label people. And you didn't even bother to go to the Statscan url I provided. If you had you would have seen this in the very first page  2011 Homicides:: Shooting 159 Stabbing 207 I think that upholds the stabbing far outweighs shooting claim. Beating and strangulation: 168 Which upholds my other claim although I will admit to a typo as I had meant to include beatings in with the strangulation (I think that was kind of obvious given the claim). Did it include accidents? No  I should have said homicides  not deaths. I have no problem admitting my mistakes. But given the overwhelming all out of proportion anger  and willingness to hurl insults  demonstrated in your response I see no possibility of useful discussion with you.,?
543,Nobody is hanging him nor shooting him.  People are expressing their feelings just as you do yours.  Conduct unbecoming for a student at any school or workplace is part of accountability.,?
544,Loved Hillary's tweet of earlier this evening .... summed it up very eloquently. @HillaryClinton,?
545,"Most Cruzes sold in the USA are made in Ohio."  I know.  Trump was throwing his toys out of his pram the other day about the few that come in from Mexico  and they are the bottom-of-the-range variety - zero value added!,?
546,YOU - are a hateful  sick person. YOU - and yours are the reason why you lost last November why We  the People hired Mr. Trump. Get out of my society and take Kaepernick and Kiszla with you!,?
547,Another ignorant comment.,?
548,Taking advantage of 13 year old girls. The guy should get 10 years at least. What a disgusting pig of a man. And to think he had the nerve to look and say "Are you happy now" as they led him off. Well no I'm not  you won't spend nearly enough time in jail.,?
549,What a despicable man he is. Self-aggrandizing  dishonest  and as big a hypocrite as has ever walked this earth. how insulting to women  and all rape victims  as well as to to all of the good Americans who support our COUNTRY. The left apparently hates Trump FAR more than they love their country  which is pathetic.,?
550,How ridiculous. She did something wrong and is now paying restitution. You all are acting like she shot someone.,?
551,Yep  ol' Steve Paddock of Mesquite  Nevada  sure looks like one of them terrorists!,?
552,With a PM like this one  who needs a communist dictator? He is a bumbling fool  a communist sympathizer  and enabler.,?
553,Thats right mike  no cure for stupid. Thats why people like you post comments like the ones you post  to prove it.,?
554,Did Kirk put the funds in no! It was the council so again he just spent the money and then took credit for it,?
555,Significant. I read that as a clear sign of collaboration by Trump.,?
556,James:  "Can you do it?"  I think the answer is YES.  regards  Gary,?
557,Can't imagine the public reaction to every stupid thing I've ever said in private.  But  man  this one was a doozy.  And if it's true she accidentally made her comment public  then that's got to be the dumbest thing she ever did.  All said  you've got to be a little bit mean at heart to make fun of an overweight old lady.   Perhaps she'll run into some snarky 20-something when she is in her 70s  and the karmic balance will be restored.,?
558,No wonder the Jays banned this Moby-looking fool from their locker room last year... these bash pieces have officially become pathetic.,?
559,Chill dude what old folks think wild is fun now.,?
560,Sigh...yet more evidence of how crazy and delusional this poor man (trump) is. What reality does he live in?,?
561,Having educational spending as a tax deduction does not seem like a particularly bad idea since it may increase educational spending and at least improve education for some children without potentially taking significant amounts away from others as vouchers could do. I would prefer to see focused efforts to improve the educational system for all children but the educational establishment has resisted efforts to make significant progress for decades so there is little hope they will suddenly look at the data and start working toward better educations for all children.,?
562,What a bunch of (D)onkeys. The Jones act is very hurtful for the state and the fact all of our hawaii leaders in DC support it shows just ineffective they are.,?
563,Excellent!  A typo: "as neither I nor Muller is " not "are.",?
564,I mind.  This is sloppy lazy untransparent governing.    Who pays?  Everyone.    Just like the embrace of giving away tax credits  also called tax expenditures  this program is intentionally sneaky.  No wonder people do not trust most of our elected leaders.  They are giving away free parking to people spending $100 000 Teslas.,?
565,I enjoy these comments by people who aren't required to prove what they claim. "guy in my building"...  As for Shelly Glover  I wouldn't know. All I know is she belongs to a party of bigots that don't give a rat's patoot about any minority.,?
566,But then who will get the $200 MILLION they've planned on spending???,?
567,They both sound like losers.,?
568,"I want to save the world"  If you want to make the world a better place start in your own hometown. I am sure that there are people in Aurora or Lamar that could have used the assistance that the people who gave to this organization though they were giving.,?
569,The biggest crime site in American history and it toke 2 years to do a report  and all the evidence was hauled off ? Bush let all the Saudis get out of the country just after...what a joke...Bush is an idiot and let the real story of "who did it" get away...Maybe because he had a hand in it??  Revenge  greed  and power is likely the motive !,?
570,The venture needs to clean up the exchange  its full of scam companies and zombie listings.  I see the same characters creating companies for the sole purpose of lining their pockets off investors.  So why does the exchange allow these fraud artists to operate with no consequences?  Exchange is now attracting tons of hyped cannabis penny stocks setup to profit only the insiders.  For the legit companies listed like CDN its an uphill battle for recognition because the exchange has such a bad reputation.  Most serious investors will not touch Venture stocks for good reason.,?
571,And you're mentally deficient,?
572,If the devil discovers the truth and reveals it  that doesn't mean that it isn't still the truth.  It just means that the devil hopes to gain from the revelation.,?
573,The Ottawa Police cleared him of any legal crime; is that true or not. Get back to me on that...we are not talking about Roman Polansky here....but people watch  his and Woody Allens movies all the time  why is that...why can Bill and Roman and Woody walk but Don cant...,?
574,Politifact??? How about an unbaised source! https://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2013/12/27/in-2008-politifacts-2013-lie-of-the-year-that-you-could-keep-your-health-plan-under-obamacare-it-rated-true/#3ed077797c14,?
575,rangerMC  obama had nothing to do with it. why dont you put the blame where it belongs  on the people running it. stupid. http://www.factcheck.org/2009/10/the-obama-phone/,?
576,The low dollar may have swung costs slightly in Canada's favour? However on anything like par I believe this is incorrect.,?
577,Excuse you. He was not a violent drug dealer  he was an unarmed man who Brendan unloaded an entire clip at! Brendan also saw Nano at my son's father house  who was Nano's son  and Brendan went home and got his gun and came back for him. Do know why Nano was at his son's house? To run away from Brendan because he was fearing his life! Don't speak on shit you don't know. I was there.,?
578,You don't know anything about who the protesters are.  For all we know they could very well be tRump supporters attempting to inflame and make it look like Hillary supporters are causing the problem.,?
579,Idiots protesting democracy & free elections because they didn't get their way.,?
580,Thank Obama for Trumps victory Roy....  His presidency was such a disaster that Americans replaced him with the person who ran the campaign that questioned his citizenship... And will go into the history books as such.  This must be especially painfull for you.  His legacy is finally complete.,?
581,Secondly  why were people evicted after the sub prime mortgage scandal in the US?  They took out loans that were beyond repayable. On their face the morgages weren't tenable  and yet people went for them. Whose fault is this?>,?
582,Here's a thought - leave the guy alone for 3-4 days to cool down  then come back and arrest him when he's caught off guard.  Everyone wins  no one dies.  Instead  cops have to escalate it and end up using a backhoe to tear down a wall to the house?  Damn cops are stupid.,?
583,You are off base Old Bannister. The issue is about a cabinet minister who has lied to everyone including to her Prime Minister  who is now doubling down on the lie to the voters.  FPP by the way is still the best system for changing governments quickly and peaceably. It's also easily understood by all voters regardless of age or education. We don't want goofy messy systems that will keep politicians in power long past their sell by date. FPP works!,?
584,But...that's not what happened.   You base your actions on "what ifs" and "would likely bes"?,?
585,Khizr Khan is a lawyer  a Muslim  and a loyal American who has been attacked by the trumpanzees for sticking it to the "dark side"   and earning the respect of millions of Americans like him.  Donald nearly cried when learned he'd been upstaged and the lies just rolled off his forked tongue like used motor oil.,?
586,So  only YOUR way is the right way? So by accident of birth had you been born in say India  you are automatically going to go to hell? Because in India the faith is Hindu correct? So by just chance  just because you happen to be born in the US which is predominantly Christian  you get to go to heaven?   Doesn't that sound just a little bit like full retard to you??,?
587,I am familiar with the area and the property on which the fire occurred has always appeared to be a hub of drug activity.  There was a shooting at the property about this time last year which involved convicted felons and known drug users.  There is always a lot of foot and vehicle traffic coming and going with a lot of people just hanging around.  I have also seen loose pit bulls on the property.  Not a desirable place to say the least.,?
588,Not sure that DEBT has demonstrated any competence to manage this task.,?
589,While I do understand that the House majority is willing to invest time and energy in any proposition that avoids addressing the critical need to adopt at least a 15% nominal top rate graduated income tax  I am sure that in your eagerness to promote your legislative agenda you will  as always  act diligently  rationally and deliberately to address ALL the ramifications of such legislation  and  in the event that you don't manage that  at least make it clear how you are going to fund both sides of the extended litigation and havoc you will otherwise be creating.,?
590,Nuke that piece of crap and destroy it all. He will never let them go. To him they are a shield. When you're done there  drop one in Sask.  Smarten those thieving farmers up.,?
591,And this garbage is the ultimate deflection. Del Mastro was a convicted liar and mentioning him is as cogent as mentioning Monsef. You apparently don't know better.,?
592,Non-profits pay taxes  too. It's a myth they don't. And you did clearly come across as against these non-profits. I do not think a sound democracy would prevent open dialog and community organizing. That would be not democracy.,?
593,You are what we call the stupid home piece.  If he can't get some strange you are always available and willing - regardless of how bad you are treated .,?
594,Wrong.  Your logic leads back to monarchy and imperialism: money buys influence  which is corruption - therefore the perpetrators have two reasons to persist in clawing more and more power to themselves: power itself and fear of prosecution.,?
595,He is a real jerk  I don't know why ANC is bearing him since Marikana killing.,?
596,Philip Klein must think all of us are ignorant  and worse  stupid.  This article is a gross over-reaction to a few folks giving words of encouragement to a friend  colleague  and respected political figure in his time of distress and uncertainty.  These folks are not moronic enough to believe a well intended  and albeit "trite" phrase is sufficient in this horrible circumstance  or that the Senator is big enough  strong enough  and smart enough to just tough it out and beat this serious threat to his life.,?
597,Plenty of middle aged and millineals who are also being haters on his induction  all idiots regardless.,?
598,As a corollary  how come the fossil fuel industry doesn't have its own collection of studies showing it's not a problem? How come government funded studies (which are not funded based on a supposition) find the exact same conclusions (even when right wing governments are in power) and how come the opponents of climate change are reduced to vague and undefined allegations of manipulation  while never quite being able to tell us where it occurred?,?
599,Anyone supporting serial misogynist and liar Trump needs their head examined!,?
600,Didn't he marry immigrants? Typical Republican hypocrite.,?
601,but but but he is an "icon",?
602,Kudos to Ken Frasier  a man who stands up for his beliefs.  Trump is such a child with his "tweets".  Sure wish that he would grow up and at least try and run his country.  The man is a buffoon and a disgrace to the office.,?
603,what rubbish  there is no such thing as a trump refugee  god the left is just completely nuts,?
604,You are a racist imbecile.  Just in case you didn't already know that.,?
605,Remember Irving Madoff?  We never got to see his tax returns either  until it was too late.  Trump has always been a classic narcissistic sociopath and his supporters are shills and dupes.,?

609,LMAO  allowing a Muslim to work at an airport in a Restricted Area!!!!!  That is just plain stupid  irresponsible and dangerous.  Uh oh  was I being Islamophobic!!,?
610,If the US cannot the demand for softwood lumber  there is nothing to worry about. Trump believes that Canada's low cost cutting rights on crown land constitutes a subsidy. This will be dealt with during  NAFTA negotiations. I look forward to Trump attacking the dairy and poultry cartels - time for the disbanding these archaic  self serving organizations. Looking forward to the competition and cheaper chicken  eggs  cheese and milk products.,?
611,C'mon  they are "literally insane"! Literally! What more do you need?,?
612,Political stupidity. No EV are made in Canada  if ever. Yet the tax payers are subsidizing these EV imports for no industrial benefit  and to damage our oil industry.,?
613,You sound like a really  really fragile non-white person. Sooooooo oppressed.,?
614,You are probably some sad faced white dude getting his kicks playing Indian. You should be ashamed of yourself. You are just like that Elizabeth Warren  thinking that one drop make you a minority so you can called everyone else "racist" or "fascist" or whatever jogged your jollies. And maybe Elise is a brave woman since she is writing under her name. What does that make you....a coward who hide behind a computer screen  fearful that someone might call you out if your real ID is revealed? Then you will be less bold  less courageous  less willing to tell me off. How sweet it must be take pot shots without any harm to yourself. In my circle  people like you are called...."gutter snipe".,?

620,Why not lay off the censorship button for a bit: this response to your purported  "in the know post" is hardly uncivil: "Oh  did the article say that?  Perhaps the intrepid reporter covering the story could have seen a demonstration of this  or even dug into the gravel to see for themselves.  Proof. Evidence. What a concept.",?
621,Exactly  Ditka. That GED thing is really working out for you. A ditch digger is a ditch digger  no matter whether he's robbed one bank or 10 or none. Are you simple?,?
622,U mad bro?,?
623,Our culture of hate today is the problem. The tragic use of weapons is a symptom. Until we honestly face the problem  we will continually argue over untenable actions  or in-actions...,?
624,Discrimination against minorities should not be addressed by deliberately introducing more discrimination. It is this attempt at a solution that is wrong and simplistic.,?
625,Utter bull-crap.  The ads were completely benign.  This is pathetic.,?
626,Firstly  we can see it in this article. He's talking fluff. The facts don't even agree with him. Secondly  I know people that work for the city that have first-hand knowledge of these idiots in the OIM and the "Advisory Board.",?
627,Queue the racists and bigots in 3...2...1...,?
628,Wow  finally an insider gives us the dope. Pray tell  can you inform us where you got this information from or are you just making stupid accusations? We are all waiting for your response.,?
629,Patrick Brown is an unprincipled coward without the ability to clean his own house.  Three examples are the riding nomination events the results of which were appealed. Despite contestants having broken the rules of the PC party the appeals were disallowed and the "winners" were accepted as good sound party members. Newmarket-Aurora comes to mind where ethics is obviously not a word in the riding dictionary.  This hardly is a vote of confidence for a young career politician who enjoys running marathons and marched in the Pride Parade. Are these latter two significant experience?  I would rather have experienced corruption any day  people with policies  no matter how misguided from time to time.  Brown is a patsy without character or conviction.,?
630,Bravo!  The democrats won't be happy until all of us are dis-armed and helplessly cowering face-down on the floor of a gay bar toilet.,?
631,Utter garbage. The reason why America didn't get inbolved is that non of the sides have clean hands...Russia and Turkey least of all.,?
632,Darn tootin'! And he's gonna make the Wassillyans pay for it  too! . You know  When Wasilla sends its people  they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems  and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some  I assume  are good people.,?
633,The genius of their plan is that they started it six months before the election  while they still thought Hillary was going to win.,?
634,Apparently you're not very good at accurately identifying tone.  That of Moore's column mostly consisted of well-deserved ridicule and sarcasm directed at those greased-up male prostitutes crapping up the statehouse.  Pretty much the OPPOSITE of "whining."  Herein endeth the lesson.,?
635,What really bothers me is all these folks complaining that Blacks are excluded from high performing whit schools ..... why don't the Black Families create a high performing Black School that whites wish  to attend?,?
636,He can't even spell "Springfield" good lord.. Also LOL that 24 hrs ago he posted a "I don't always correct spelling but when I do I google it so I don't look stupid " meme!,?
637,You have outdone yourself in your self-righteousness. Hopefully the gene pool ended with you.,?
638,Oh my.  Let's take a quick look at DT's career stats for a moment...  https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/T/ThomDe03.htm  He's averaged 98 receptions and 1370 yards/yr over the last 5 seasons.,?
639,Kinder Morgan's pipeline is a stupid idea from the get-go  because there is no equipment to clean-up a filthy  tar sands spill. The dilbit is riddled with cancer-causing toxins. This stupid idea is an insult to the intelligence of the British Columbian people. Also  the tanker corporations have no equipment to clean-up a dirty  tar sands spill. Dump KM  to save beautiful BC.,?
640,Yes,?
641,Yes and the same kind of denial is directed at social science. Homeless haters  for example  refuse to understand anything about what is really driving homelessness: a shortage of jobs  low wages  and high rents. They deny social reality because they don't want to pay taxes to do anything about social issues. Then they complain bitterly at the results  as society crumbles around them. I see no cure until things get so bad that they realize something has to be done. There is no cure for stupidity.,?
642,These  Republican Senators ran on repealing and replacing Obamacare that is what their constituents wanted,?
643,Motion to dissolve parliament will fail. Block resignations won't work (as per Prof de Vos). The DA's approach is as useless as it is annoying.,?

647,Just watch. These politicians will turn this into another episode of watching idiots make bigger fools of themselves.,?
648,Ha Ha My bad!  You da man.,?
649,Democracy ruled and now the left loons  cry,?
650,Prove it.  The Donald is too chicken to release his tax returns.  Remember he promised to release them until he changed his mind.  Why phony conservatives defend such a hypocritical moron is beyond me.  What gender is the Donald?  Yes he is probably male but how much orangutan?,?
651,Agreed. Folks like this angry  bitter columnist are also engaging in the racism of low expectations  by implying those who would be "disenfranchised" by voter ID laws are too stupid or incompetent to obtain one.,?
652,I disagree Jeff.  The Greens and NDP are intermixed with the same voters switching back and forth.  BCers across the province have now been empowered to vote Green and the NDP is wise enough not to burn that bridge.  Not so different from the Socred right wing coalition which encompasses Conservatives  Liberals and Libertarians.,?

655,Wasn't this guy working in the Traffic division where other officers have also been in the news? In the past there was something about dui overtime & stolen cars.,?
656,Yes - you'll have to come up with some evidence for "Anyone who says that the Front Range is not any more violent than it used to be is sorely mistaken and in denial" claim.,?
657,I'm hard-pressed to think of how a lying  know-nothing  unqualified  egomaniacal  thin-skinned  p***y-grabbing President could be an inspiration to anyone except his taxidermist.,?

659,What's abhorrent is that John McCain is a RINO liar,?
660,Utter rubbish. If a male Conservative politician had said that a female Liberal couldn't understand math he'd be run out of office by a leftist  politically correct rent a mob...,?
661,Hopefully a sobering moment for the driver  who now will live whatever life he has left with being responsible for the death of a friend.   People these days have no responsible forethought when speeding/texting/drinking/drugging or whatever it is they do behind the wheel of a vehicle besides just driving.  Driving an automobile is a privilege.  I hope this driver loses that privilege for the rest of his selfish life.,?
662,Maybe but anyway you slice it:  - it's less addicitive that cigarettes  alcohol or even caffeince - the health effects are much less than cigarettes or alcohol - the impact on driving is far less than alcohol - it is not a gateway drug  So anyway you slice it its much safer than multiple legal products consumed by millions everyday,?
663,WHY was THIS commented DELETED???!!! "soundofreason  17 hours ago  This is the WRONG state to EVER be criticizing ANY one else's tax policy. Hypocrisy at its best.  Article might have well have read..."Feds take the next increase we were going to hit you with",?
664,Oh yeah  Medicare  the government health insurance that is slated for insolvency by 2028; long before I get to use a single penny of it. And  I have to pay for your stupid Medicare against my will. Guess what happens if I don't pay my medicare insurance (that I don't want)? I go to jail. Yes. If I don't pay this ridiculous medicare tax  men with guns take me to jail. So no. It's not a lie. If you don't understand that at the bottom of every idiotic government mandate is the barrel of a gun  you are ignorant and/or delusion.,?
665,I drive the opposite direction during rush hour thank goodness!  It is interesting to watch the oncoming traffic and see what causes slow downs and the rear enders. Most of the back ups I see are caused by slow moving trucks and cars.  People for the most part are going 65 and when they merge over to pass a car going 50 or 55 everything gets backed up for miles and the person going slow is being Safe....    Also people not keeping a constant speed is an issue. It is interesting to watch people going outbound up Peters creek hill just over the bridge  It is like they forget that they have a gas peddle and slow down to 55 going back up the hill after crossing the bridge. this causes back ups and the occasional carnage due to people not paying attention to the car in front of them and following to close.,?
666,Get over it ADN  what a sore loser. This is why he is the new POTUS.,?
667,disgraceful! this project needs to be killed  permanently.,?
668,The best the left can muster is that every Republican is either stupid or mean or both.  At the root  that's all they can assemble  apart from flowering up their assessment with protest signs and lots of emotion and dismissiveness.   Now emotionally emptied and drained from overuse of that faculty.,?
669,Good!  This is one of the first times I have seen a Hawaii judge impose the maximum sentence and it was well deserved in this case.  Way to go Judge Soong!,?
670,This is a good but poorly funded effort. IIRC I reported that the 2016 PATCH report indicated that only about seven million was used by this nonprofit for subsidies to needy kids.   Currently budget in 2017 is about 12 million this year. But a report put out about three years ago by the Abercrombie Administration indicated that a minimum of 21 million is needed in subsidies for this program. Which means that only about a third of the needy in 2016 qualified for subsidies.  We need more than token efforts. Sun Sun has no respect for needy kids.,?
671,Hillary Clinton's speaking style? The myriads of lies? The voice of a cackling crow? The person who attempted to destroy her sexual predator husband's victims?,?
672,That rain is gonna knock all those berries off the bushes. Yep  I gripe louder than anybody when I have to go shovel that cussed snow or freeze my fingers doing some chore but after 55 years I'm still here. Look out across the Copper River at those mountains all purple and orange in a midwinter sunset or the valley all golden during fall  watch the giant flakes of that first snow falling so peacefully  step out in your front yard to watch a lynx who's watchin' you watch him and gees  it all balances right out. I hope someday they sprinkle me up the creek someplace where big old Grandaddy wolf can walk silently over me. I'll be content for eternity right there among the wild flowers and moose beans.,?
673,Richard  if you honestly believe your medical costs or insurance rates will go down if riders are required to wear helmets  you are living in a dream world. My insurance went up over an additional $100 per year simply because I got one year older (that statement from the insurance company). No claims  just went from 75 to 76 years old !!,?
674,Trudeau has no clue and did he really think Canadians would go along with this unbelievably stupid decision.  He should hang his head in shame for using public funding to reward a terrorist murderer.  Trudeau is the most irresponsible PM this country has ever had and should be forced out of office immediately.,?
675,Actually  number one on the agenda is Amy Demboski's resignation.,?
676,It was the Know-Nothing Party.,?
677,Or just stop foreign purchases and preserve our farmland. Sounds better to me.,?
678,Please don't give him credit. He is just plain stupid  always was and always will be.,?
679,The cost of educating a child in a state the geographical size of a mid-size nation is not a boondoggle.  Alaska's cost of running the ship of state cannot be compared to Texas or Montana since those states already have infrastructure throughout.  So when you say we pay too much and disregard the price of healthcare delivery here (your largest expense driver)  distance and climate challenges you are being infantile.,?
680,Yet another  example of disgraceful  corrupt scofflaws running Eugene's bureaucracy.,?
681,If you are an Albertan you don't know squat about the industry. And your use of 'tars sands' betrays you as either an environmental ideologue with an axe to grind or a mis-informed millennial. Or both.,?
682,Thanks Kelly Howard-- yes  Veneta was especially  bad this year--noise  fire danger  the whole bit.  Plenty of folks who don't give a darn about others.  And if we do get the city to do something about it so we and our pets can relax  these jerks will scream "this Nazi government is  taking   MY rights away!!!!,?
683,Bullfeathers. She just spoke truth to those in power too stupid to understand our role in Global Warming and hide behind some religious nonsense - including some Globe & Mail writers like Wente and sometimes the sly Ibbitson.,?
684,"This is a non-story."  That's silly  Dilly.  Bannon is a fascist of the first order.  Anything about him is interesting.,?

686,Bill Walker is a traitor. He belongs in shakeles and chains. He should be fed dog food and drifted out on the cook inlet on a piece of plywood at a changing tide,?
687,From the September 22  1998 ADN: "Downtown's sole Assembly member said he wants to devote more time to his family and his writing career. Wohlforth  35  represents a...".  Found that right off the bat.  Verification is only an problem if you don't try.  As for the other part  find a copy of Who's Who in Alaskan Politics and look up the entry for Eric Wohlforth.  I've been here virtually my whole life  too.  That matters little to the adherents of the "Church of Born and Raised".  You know  the sort of people who judge you based solely upon where you were born.  Here in Fairbanks among my generation  there are still folks who treat anyone not born at St. Joseph's as second-class citizens or worse.  Thanks for replying  though.  Last time I checked in  my comment was "approved" but somehow disappeared from sight.  I left another comment pointing this out  then suddenly it reappeared.  Amazing how that works.,?
688,Gee  then I guess what I saw with my own eyes - including Trump's reaction to it - was wrong.  Further  the good old Polish Presudent has his own problems with "media liars" who promulgate fake news about him. It's gotten to where politicians just cannot lie with impunity and get away with it anymore.   Note:  All any person who feels they've been lied about has to do is prove the lie with actual evidence and facts.  So far  Trump - infamous proven  pathological liar - and his whining Polish buddy haven't been able to meet that mediocre standard.,?
689,Since lynching is such a favorite among your like minded racists you thought you'd throw in a little lynching to cement your place among the racists.  You're disgusting.,?
690,says the queen bee of ignorant comments. look   she has reared her ugly bigot racist head again. i hope they don't ban your account everybody is getting lots of giggles reading your dumbass comments,?
691,Flagged: no substance  no proof  no substance- just verbal and personal ad hominems. You add no value to these posts  and how your uncivil hatred is passing the Civil Comments system is beyond anyone.,?
692,Why go to the airport? Picking up passengers and luggage taking them to Middle street so they can again move luggage to a bus. Why not just board the bus at the airport? Eliminate 5 miles of unneeded rail.,?
693,Who gives these scumbag politicians the right to tax us for these idiots. They put this crap in their body's of their own free will  suffer. Just pick up the body's and feed them to pictons pigs.,?
694,At least we're getting tax breaks and a wall.....oh wait 😂 #duped,?
695,Neko  you and your friends are the trolls.,?
696,you will believe any bs nonsense brain washed fool that you are shore,?
697,I would rather they put the money into a job training program to get the skilled workers  rather than importing them.,?
698,Since you brought somone's skin colour into it - Racist!.,?
699,Canada is run by a traitor.Pure and simple this child is a traitor.,?
700,Guard: "What is your purpose in travelling to the United States?" Foreign Agitator: "You crazy bastiches elected the wrong person and we are heading down there to spoil the inauguration and really tell you what deplorable idiots you all are." Guard: "Hm.  No thanks.",?
701,Fat ankles  fat cat criminal.  It works both ways...,?
702,Good on Hamilton but I find that F1 can be a bit of a bore. That said our Canadian Lance Stroll is doing ok for an F1 rookie a 6th place in Brazil  LOL on his 19th birthday.,?
703,This will start to get real as Ontario heads towards bankruptcy.,?
704,The price is one thing but the real deal killer is the lack of utility.,?
705,Vile and disgusting. Pathetic.,?
706,Nope. He bragged about being able to assault women because he's famous. The language used is irrelevant. He talked about having walked up to women and kiss them and they didn't do anything because of his fame. That's assault. He's essentially confessing to having assaulted women in the past. He didn't say he actually grabbed any genitals but he bragged that he could do it.  The best part to me ... is the fool couldn't figure out how to get off the bus while he's trying to make fun of Gerald Ford. He's a putz. Anyone supporting him is a fool.,?
707,In future elections  Catholics need to distance themselves as quickly as possible from the "Breitbart" base of the Republican party that gave us Trump as a candidate. They are toxic. Trump's supporters are so vile that the only thing they accomplished is to guarantee that Hillary Clinton will be our next president. That is what happens when you make a bargain with the devil. Evangelicals who continue to support Trump have no moral integrity. Mike Pence is an absolute hypocrite. Thank goodness for Paul Ryan  Jeb Bush and other principled Republicans. Elections don't have to be this way. Bernie Sanders is a great example of how a respected rival can push a candidate to moderate her position on specific issues. Catholics need to pray for social justice candidates who can have the same impact. That means either an Eisenhower Republican or a Pro-life Democrat. https://goo.gl/KNAc7A,?
708,Most incomprehensible comment.  Ever.  Just dumb.  Please explain whatever it was you felt compelled to say in a public forum.  Please.,?
709,"Progressives seek to unite  not divide."  ===  You can tell by the whole "He's got one more buck than you  so he's an evil rich person who should be forced to give up his stuff  and besides he can afford it" thing lefties have going. Real unifying stuff.  The Bircher thing  that's got legs. Trumpism -- protectionism  isolationism  distrust of anything not them -- is very reminiscent of Bircherism.,?
710,He is mentally ill. His narcissistic rhetoric is Clue Number One! When will Congress wake up and do something about it? Too frightened to act? Then at least REACT!!!! The crickets are astounding!,?
711,He would rather support a corrupt politician than anyone else.  Party before country? The Democrats are pathetic!,?
712,bavius   One day you should give as the coordinates of your home. You just sound much too dumb to be Canadian. So where do you actually live?,?
713,Trumps a moron. This whole thing is ridiculous. They are protesting something they believe in  and if the NFL doesn't care  why should he? Our country is built on the basic principle that you have the freedom to express your views and protest. There is a right and a wrong here and it's obvious what side trump falls on. If you are against the idea of them protesting then perhaps its time to look in a mirror. You might be racist.,?
714,WOW!  A drop in property taxes.  Can't wait! Wait a minute--can't the city then raise property values to raise about the same amount of funds ?  Why  they'd never do that  would they?  Also  what's to keep the city from again raising those property taxes again and again so that  after a couple of years  property owners are paying more for their increased-value property PLUS BerKy's gas tax.  Ummm...guess it's not so exciting  after all.  No thanks!,?
715,The damn thing needs to be funded with a voter approved bond measure  not by undercutting services and funded with the general fund account.,?
716,You gotta hit the Americans where it hurts.,?
717,Exactly.  Nowhere are there any numbers supporting gta prices levelling off.,?
718,If the Europeans are really "afraid of Russia" they're more pathetic than anyone thought.,?
719,Using your political opponent's catch phrase is not very original.,?
720,Tsk  tsk  Gerald  for once more trotting out the hoary old myth that Ralph Nader caused Gore to lose to Bush in 2000.  That would be false even if the Florida mafia had not stolen the state for Bush.   Besides  this is democracy in action  isn't it?  Frankly  both main parties are appalling; people are holding their noses and voting for the least awful candidate.,?
721,Violent burglary in 2013 and out on the street.....This crap will only get worse under SB91. Prepare to defend yourselves Alaska!,?
722,$30 billion more debt. Liberals are fiscal morons.,?
723,Wasn't there a recent story in the DP about Brazil destroying their rain forests and we  by not joining the Paris agreement  wouldn't be obligated to send them U.S. money to clean the mess up? Trump was correct.,?
724,The orange man is the most divisive president in American history -- period!,?
725,I thought that bike lane on S King was experimental.  Two years since and the city has not revealed if it is successful.  Hence  it was never an experiment but a permanent fixture.  As usual  we were lied to again.  And NO  I am not accepting the stupidity of that bike lane.,?
726,Perhaps Not Joe you could provide a link to prove this study was paid for by industrial farming corporations.,?
727,If the Chinese become the chief source of alternative energy  I'm betting they will sell it to us!  Since in the United States  "Wind power provides 4.1% of the nation's electricity."  and Solar power currently produces 0.59% of US renewable energy and 0.08% of total energy."  We can probably switch if it becomes less expensive to do so.    In the meantime  only 4.77 per cent of our total energy is in that technology.,?
728,Keep trying to sell it   just like the Federal election where Harper was the devil  and now look at the fool we have at the helm.,?
729,Really  R.D.?  As usual  you try to start trouble where there is none.,?
730,You really don't get it?  Or are you faking?  I am speaking about the need to go beyond simple regulations hon.  It is called being morally responsible and doing the right thing.  Too many moral zombies out here.,?
731,I understand this is a tough issue folks are tired of the crime and these folks go in and out of jail all the time. Please enforce our laws and hold people accountable. I think a lot of this is caused by the lack of us holding people FULLY accountable. We need to send a message to anyone committing any crime- anyone- the full extent of the law will be held up here in Port Angeles. You also need to pay your fines and do the time. If you don't like it stop breaking the law. I read an article about people getting a break for the fines ??????? I just don't get it. I'm sad almost daily about the out of control crime in our town. I wish I knew the answer.,?
732,see a shrink a conservative one or plain take youre head out of youre ars its stuck im sure,?
733,Yes you are.  And you are jealous that he didn't grab your p****   sir! Mahalo!,?
734,Yep communicating what a total idiot he is.,?
735,another rich  old timer mouthing ignorant racist comments.,?
736,We didn't. The idiot president man child did.,?
737,You are a world class idiot.,?
738,"We’ve already been paying the surcharge for 10 years and to extend it would be virtually painless. "  Foolish to be believe THAT will even be enough.  They're just selling you down the road..bit by bit.,?
739,Don't be a moron.  You certainly don't remember anything I've posted.  It's a new hobby since Trump got elected.  I refuse to let MAGAphants like you control the discussion since you rank as some of the stupidest people I've ever come across.,?
740,She will be whatever she needs to be in order to gain office. Once she is there she will not give a crap what you think.,?
741,So how long have you been a Snowflake? Unable to handle the real world as it is.  Not accepting anything you do not like  do not agree with. Exactly my point.  Sad.,?
742,Ignorant and uneducated. I am a human advocate as well as a a CANNABIS (use the correct word  don't show your stereotyping/ prejudice so openly) advocate. Your intelligence is lacking at best. I'd be happy to debate you and embarrass you on the lack of factual information swimming around in your confused head.,?
743,Stupid is as stupid elects.,?
744,What is worse than ignorance? Ignorant that he is ignorant. It is the case for Trump  judging by his gushing expression and feeling no embarrassment (to tell the whole World that he doesn't know) whatsoever after he learned something that any educated person at his age should know. No wonder what he does depends on who is the last person talking to him. Riddance the White House of extremist like Bannon sure will help Trump. That's the state of affairs in Trump's administration. Sigh!,?
745,Just walk out of the EU  no payments  no security  no deals.  Much easier.,?
746,Typical Canadian treacle. Two steps below a Tims ad and twice as sappy. You guys are pathetic.,?
747,After WW2 Italians  Poles  Ukrainians  Finns  Dutch and other people came to Canada   no assistance  no welfare  and without Gov't programs found jobs  educated their children and helped build this country. They did not beg or cry or were a burden on the system. Stop the scam. Stop bringing people who can not or will not help themselves. Time for the bleeding hearts and goody two shoes to wake up. The experiment has failed. Shit or get off the pot!!!!!,?
748,Hopefully some liberals were killed!!!,?
749,left wingers  put the hate and stupidity in everything,?
750,.  A sham? You my Dear Sir/Madame are too kind.  Jason Kenney is a scumbag of mammoth/biblical proportions. Period  .,?
751,Yep..you're right...everyone KNOWS that all those terrorists and criminals IMMEDIATELY STOPPED their killing  dope dealing  bombings  and terrorizing the SECOND obama was out of office  was history.  Yep  same with klinton  and his infamous pardons  esepcially Marc Rich  whose string of convictions included dealing with the enemy.  Or his pardoning of FALN terrorists responsible for deaths of US citizens and police officers.  Yeah....much better to go after a misdemeanor contempt of court charge...although given the Unconstitutional legislating from the bench  and the patently political decisions  ...there are many people out in the real world that have nothing BUT contempt for some of our federal courts and "jurists".  The title of THAT opinion letter should have been "Prime example of left wing hypocrisy.",?
752,Israel cites biblical and historical connections to Jerusalem and the West Bank..  I'm sure our First Nations can cite similar connections to all of Turtle Island.,?
753,If your going to SFO forget about Alaska Air - they've been gouging the route for the last year.  Even with LOW fuel prices they keep upping the fare.  Last time I checked Delta was about $200 cheaper than Alaska for a round trip.,?
754,Trump's all about stirring his swamp full of excrement.,?
755,Wow  both countries have insane leaders.  trump has the code!,?
756,Why should our hearts bleed for Putin's puppets being sent back to Siberia  Bill ?  Good riddance to bad rubbish !  Should have been done the moment that the evidence of Russian hacking first emerged if you ask me.,?
757,Another group of kids still wet behind the ears .  There is no doubt some adults put these kids up to this . This is almost as stupid as our assembly putting a kid on the assembly who will waste everyone's time by being there.,?
758,================= "What is the difference between this and  say  Alberta imposing a tax on goods made in British Columbia that are trucked through its territory on the way to Saskatchewan?" =============================  Good point by the GM.  Unmentioned in the article is Alberta's potential leverage over electricity exports from B.C.'s now under construction Site C Hydro Project.  Canada was constituted in a way to prevent these sorts of behaviors from proliferating and thereby allowing free flow of goods and services.  Should this practice spread someone may rightfully ask what need is there for a Canada at all.,?
759,Must you politicize even a prayer?,?
760,It is time for the working tax payers to take a stand against insane carbon taxation policies.,?
761,This initiative will never take effect. It officially kicks in on Jan. 1  but gives the city council 6 months to repeal. Since the mayor and most of the city council are against the bill  it will no doubt be repealed with promises to implement a "light" version in the future. Since most new development in the city is through special permit zones  the city council will selectively require developments to include green roofs as a way to show commitment to the principle of the initiative.,?
762,Germany does benefit from a lower priced Euro. Perhaps they don't have total control over the price of the Euro  they are by far the largest and most sound entity in the Euro so they benefit from the weakness of the other players. Currency is a huge issue. Poloz talking down the Cdn $. It's at $.076. A few years ago $1.00. Let's go back to $0.62? Hail to the resources!,?
763,Yes  the clown like  flightless birds now make me wanna puke.  Totally gutless,?
764,Canada is a country for losers  by losers. If you've got an unfounded sense of entitlement and victim hood  Canada is for you!,?
765,This situation has been sitting there in plane sight since last year when it was disclosed that Podesta and Hillary carried suitcases full of money home from Russia.    Another obvious crime package is the IT scandle with the Paki gigolo and Debbie Wasserman Schultz with millions of dollars  stolen government computers  smashed hard drives and ties to Paki Intell.  But what is being investigated?????   A Russian election and graft fanticy between Putin and President Trump......................,?
766,290 million wasted on a sheet pile job that should have cost 50 million  and wasn"t even safe or industry standard !!!!!   All the rich insiders stole their living from the rest of us again  and stole 5 years of Anchorage School District budget cuts  teachers  and services to poor  disabled and at risk students.  Just a huge example of the corrupt  sick people brainwashing the voters and inhabiting our public institutions. Just sick !!!!!,?
767,OMG trump is one resounding IDIOT !!!!!!,?
768,OK  but I would have thought as a lawyer you would have had a greater appreciation for the quality of arguments  not just the conclusion. We all have a 50% chance of getting the conclusion conclusion  but only a good argument can convince the judge and win the case. ;-)  Speaking of lawyering  I imagine Trumpism has got some of your clients worried sick?,?
769,Fuck off isis from this world u killers.,?
770,But I assume you are okay with women paying for a bunch of limp-dicked males and their viagra.  You do realize how beneficial birth control is to men?  Maybe you don't  but there are plenty of men that want to plan their families using female birth control  or men who wish to enjoy sex with a partner without the risk of pregnancy.  You must also know that the number of abortions decreases when women's contraception is widely available and free.  But then again  you are clearly a MAGAphant  white male who listens to Fox news for your opinions.  What a lapdog.,?
771,It wasn't mud.  It was aids urine.  Antifa is into some sick satanic stuff.  As far as any feces  its just a jew thing.,?
772,Scumbag racist,?
773,Before you troll me  just read the whole comment. A 17 year old white high school girl saying stupid racist shit makes headlines in this Country. But it's cool to be racist as long as you're pumping money into the dirty  kfc covered finger lickin good hands of the ANC  and to demonize white people and divide our fragile nation even further. The entire "White Monopoly Capital" agenda from these dip-shits has caused so much division and hatred in this country that the true cost cannot be fully accounted. This is for me  apart from the looting of our state  a bigger problem than all their other crimes. They've divided SA once again. The GUPTAS(!!!????!!!) have turned back the clock  together with Duduzani the IDIOT  on 23 years of all of us  white  black  indian  coloured trying desperately to get along for all these years. So lets focus on the real issues as a nation  and not create sensational headlines by blowing isolated incidences of racism out of proportion.,?
774,Do you claim your wife and yourself on your State and Federal income taxes?  How about your mortgage payments?  Your property tax payment?  Your over 65 exemptions?   How about medical expenses?  Any donations to charities?  If you take any or all of these legal deductions your taxes are reduced accordingly.    If you had a business (or like Trump  144 of them) you would also be able to take deductions regarding that (or those) businesse(s).     Lots of people in this country don't pay taxes.    Some of them  the lowest income ones  get free money from the government instead when they file their income taxes.  It is called the Earned Income Tax Credit.    https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/individuals/earned-income-tax-credit/eitc-earned-income-tax-credit-questions-and-answers  You may disagree with the tax policies for Trump's businesses or for you and your family or for those who get EITC.    But  someone who takes advantage of the tax laws to their advantage is not evil.,?
775,So  you have no ideas. That is what I thought.,?
776,Why I must I have to explain things to people? Obamacare is bankrupting healthcare providers and individuals. I am so sick of people thinking that they are entitled to things. You're not. Obamacare was created as step one in the overall plan to create single payer healthcare and if you think that it's a good idea to have the government run your healthcare  then all I can say is that you're an idiot. Single payer is a danger to the elderly and if that is not enough reason to oppose it  then once again  you're an idiot.,?
777,That's neat. Very fitting. I would imagine anyone would be proud to serve on that ship.,?
778,The system works because it brings investment into this country and  ultimately  skilled labour into this country. Without immigrants  Canada's population would actually be DECLINING  so it's high time that biased whiners get over their fear of minorities and deal with the fact that we NEED new blood to keep our economy growing.,?
779,Good for Tobias Lütke of Shopify for taking a stand of  'Freedom' -- by his not being manipulated by those who pompously believe they have the right to Dictate' by leveraging the Human predilection to congeal into a massive 'mob mentality' blob..  Shopify is open for business & should not have to kowtow to these keyboard Overlords who  in reality  have absolutely no '$$skin in the game$$'..  Currently in Canada  Nordstrom has proven that it is complicit in dragging US politics over the border as well  by throwing away a beautiful fashion business line -- such as that of Ivanka Trump. Nordstrom should stick to fashion & stay out of manipulating PR with political nonsense.  Using Social Media to organize mobs of people to destroy a business or a human being for that matter is an abuse of the very technology built to improve the intellectual prowess of Humans.  To bad so many have decided to play 'God' -- trying to deny a democratic process & the needs of hard working Entrepreneurs.,?
780,Excellent advice for any generation.  Contentment has been associated with ever greater spending and consumption  but it's a false association.,?
781,Flagging all posts by this poser who plays the drunk indian. Disgusting.,?
782,Retiring players numbers is idiotic  in all cases.  Honor the player and number in a Ring of Honor  etc.  That should be enough.,?
783,How is Dave a hypocrite? Is he a bully?,?
784,Our dumb politicians cuz their brains is where the sun don't shine.,?
785,Jay  stop running like a gutless coward  answer the simple question.,?
786,RE: "That fat fool in NK has to be taken out  and so far it look like Trump is the only one with the guts to do it  and do the world a favour."  Right now millions of people in NK are thinking "That fat fool in Washington has to be taken out  and so far it look like our Dear Leader is the only one with the guts to do it  and do the world a favour.",?
787,Wait a minute  Navy evasive about taking blame??  The Navy has been more forthcoming about an UNREGULATED chemical than any other organization in the US.  PFOA was the standard aviation fire retardant chemical in this country - but I don't see 3M  SEATAC  or anyone else going through the same steps as the Navy.  They have tested well water  is purchasing water for people with contaminated wells  had multiple community meetings - in other words  the Navy is spending a lot of money on remediating contamination they have no legal requirement to remediate and which is found in thousands of commercial products (non stick pans  pizza boxes  Gortex  etc).  Let's not be misleading.,?
788,They should have been republicans  then they can ask cheeto #1 to pardon them like he did that Arapaio idiot.,?
789,no one is deserting anything you ignorant fool    trump is staying and running the show  and the gop seeing there has been no russia collusion and this bs claim on obstruction is 100% bs   they are all behind him    just watch the health bill coming this weekend  pure trump support  period..,?
790,This is soo true! Why are scum like Andrew Scheer and Lindsay Graham even allowed to have twitter accounts?,?
791,Well that's California and just one more reason why  would never  ever live there. And if that IS true  then there is no need to have speed limits at all. The speed limit is  in practical terms  whatever the wolf pack wants to drive. Stupid.,?
792,president Trump - Republican US Senate - Republican US House - Republican Any effort by president Trump to fight or alter the sanctions?  The rest  just more European hypocrisy  backstabbing  and playing us for suckers.,?
793,Wow  what an ignorant  gross generalization!    Over 45 years ago many people were raising concerns regarding ever-increasing  pollution  and the damage being done to the ecology.  Do you know what generation those people were?   BABY BOOMERS!!   Do some research before posting such nonsense.,?
794,Tim Kaine is not only a fool but apparently  a lousy lawyer too. Ditto senators like Pat Leahy who describe Russia as "our sworn enemy". Never in my lifetime has that been official U.S. policy toward Russia OR the Soviet Union. These people have no regard for how dumb they make themselves look.,?
795,WOW! "COLLUSION" was never mentioned by any DimmLibs here! New DimmLib mantra..."OBSTRUCTION" is the new schtick. Already EGG on the DimmLib FACES and now BLOOD on their HANDS...IDIOCY has overridden  STUPIDITY. POTUS Trump's YUUUGE Election WIN brought the TRUE DimmLib MENTALITY. While the DimmLib party is in total SELF DESTRUCT/DISARRAY POTUS Trump is #MAGA!! #PMPK,?
796,Good job smelly.....way to attack the message and not the messenger..,?
797,When paying a Vancouver taxi with a credit card you are prompt to select a percentage for tip  it starts with 20% up to 40%... And they are surprised we want Uber...,?
798,Seriously majority of society's people are too stupid or lazy to vote for the other options. They hate the dem or Rep choices so much that they'd vote for their opposite rather than vote their conscience assuming they have one.   The parties have made people apathetic and lazy.  Sad but true.,?
799,You have to admit  Trump is draining the swamp by firing everybody he has hired. Soon he'll be the only reptile left.,?
800,HRC  dishonest and disgusting.,?
801,The really scary thing is that millions of people knew about Trump's connections to Putin and voted him in anyway. Either they're too stupid to know what's going on in Russia or they don't care - either way  scary!,?
802,They dont have much of a choice  the Leafs goalie depth is incredibly bad  even worse than their defensive depth at this point.  Bibeau is probably the best of the bunch and thats not saying much.   They have some potential at NCAA in Woll but thats a long way off from this point even if he pans out.  They need Anderson to stay healthy and play more games than he ever has before...we will see how it all unfolds but truth be told  the Leafs probably are in the lottery draft this year again anyways.  If Ramo provides a .909 SV% like he did for Calgary last year the Leafs would be very happy.,?
803,this is a poorly articulated opinion piece. the largest problem is giving credit to nancy pelosi for taking back the house in 2006. she was a pathetic strategist then as she is now. it was rahm emanuel who took back the house by fitting the candidate to the district,?
804,Actually  my brother's clinic is in Goldsboro N.C.  and he's long been an advocate for the increased use of "physician's assistant" programs  further reducing resolution times for the majority of UC visitors. Increasing overall load on our health system naturally will result in more time spent obtaining care  but innovative alternatives can help mitigate those waits. Also  an "ER" typically would not be the primary provider of health care for those individuals with a case file seeking ongoing intervention  unless a threatening condition arises. I believe that the ACA has mandated the availability of online medical records for use by appropriate medical personnel  although I have no idea of it's implementation timeline.  All that said  the insufficient amount of replacement doctors throughout our nation is another significant stumbling block just ahead.,?
805,Great point Art Campbell!  After all  look at Sweden. They haven't sent any troops to the Middle East and they have remained accordingly free of extremist violence. Their newcomers are settling in well  to boot.,?
806,In this particular case  a hotel opening IS politics  since Trump still owns his company and will still profit where his company profits.  If Trump doesn't want people protesting his businesses  the solution is simple: SELL HIS BUSINESSES just like every other President before him has done.,?
807,the shameless *&^%s were limiting him to 3 posts a day because he wasn't voting how these liberal maggots demand we vote.,?
808,Keep our boys out of the African cesspool. Zero value.,?
809,I had to go with 'not sure' simply because who knows about those that were let in during our dictator's rein.  Our borders were 'open to the public' as long as 'you' voted for 'me' attitude.  Also  don't forget about the hidden cells that pop up every now and then  they are not necessarily muslims either.  We are really not 'safe' until the Libs stop 'looking for votes'.  One sure way to stop the libs  take away his mighty pension and put them under Obamacare.  LOL  watch them squeal like a pig!!!!,?
810,Finally  somebody with some balls.  If it were Hillary she'd be at a podium flapping her gums and blowing hot air about what a terrible thing Syria did and how they'd better not do it again!!  Trump just sent some missles over and killed them.,?
811,The problem the Church has is that it cannot reconcile counting the begats and the Eden story with the out of Africa theories which show intelligent people before any act of cosmic disobedience.  They lack the imagination to realize that the Eden story was a universal ethic about blame  not a single event of disobedience.,?
812,they claimed to have proof they were chemically poisoned  their proof was thorough debunked through unbiased studies of the water source they claimed to have inflected them. that you are incpale of addressing this fact and keep spamming my post with your ridiculous nonsense  well  you can be a troll online if you want. your choice  but the bottom line is  these shameless liberal liars were busted lying  and their evidence they tainted was busted as well. run along troll ,?
813,Why does Trudeau want NAFTA negotiated first?  It is just a stalling tactic  and yes the libertarians know all about this. Adding ignorant insults clearly demonstrates your argument is without substance.,?
814,Huh Alberta liberal? A party of one After this Khadre screw job A federally party of one You people are like cockroaches,?
815,The Pew Monuments will be eliminated. I hope  and as I continuously scour the web to find content related to the fishing industry  that include Coast Guard info. Just as soon as the original story of possible budget cut were revealed  Coast Guard searches on the net revealed endless stories of drug busts and the articles were coming like gang busters. Buried were the stories of the CG flying various marine mammals that had been "saved" to exotic locations for NOAA. Time to return the CG to its core mission of life saving.,?
816,Weaponized in the minds of ignorant people.,?
817,KP  I like your "out of the box" thinking.  At the moment  however--just as it would not be cost-effective for Hawaii to mfg its own internal combustion vehicles  I think it is--not yet--for HI to cost-effectively make its own robots for local use--thereby not only keeping the money spent on automation in Hawaii--and generating potential profits that also would stay in HI  instead of being exported--AS IS ALREADY THE CASE WITH THE VAST MAJORITY OF BUSINESS PROFITS CURRENTLY GENERATED BY HAWAII'S ECONOMY --those profits could be captured locally and also more equitably distributed to local residents  particularly those who lose jobs and/or income when their former jobs become partially or fully automated.  But I think many  and perhaps most  in Hawaii still think that--because most jobs in HI are in the service sector (broadly defined)--most assume such jobs cannot easily be automated.  But I have good reasons to disagree.,?
818,I stalked you all day?  What the heck are you talking about?   I commented to you maybe twice in the last few days -   Please don't flatter yourself.  And it is the height of cowardice to post comments disparaging posters behind their back.  If you have something to say about me - have the decency to say it TO me.  And Kurgan does stalk me...but I have been advised it's being taken care of.   And I don't burst out crying.  I defend myself from silly attacks like yours.,?
819,So far it seems team Trudeau is not doing too bad in their approach to the US they are good at building relationships at least  but in negotiating it remains to be seen  worrisome. What are our must haves  and our like to haves  and our nonnegotiable issues etc.? We need to think big and strategically  smarter  this is more an opportunity than a threat. We are at an advantage because we have many natural resources  starting with energy in it's different forms. And we are reliable  historically at least  we have to do some housecleaning. I saw Dominic Barton talk at an economic plans conference in Ottawa on TV  and he didn't have a good answer on exports and international business. So our government must be relying on the Trade Commissioner Service  these guys aren't very strategic either from what I have seen  worrisome! I could recommend leaving the energy negotiations last. Starting with something of little value  and followed by valuable auto manufacturing sector to our advantage.,?
820,Yeah  monopolies are great for everyone. Governments should just leave businesses alone to do whatever they want.,?
821,Britain made a mistake.  They should aborgate Brexit and get serious.,?
822,Uh  Rebecca  you are seriously wrong.  You have a morality deficit.  And judging by your spelling  you're functionally illiterate as well.,?
823,Come on you can do better than that!  There are laws against driving under the influence.  Not an issue.,?
824,Wow! Typical leftie throwing around words you don't now the meaning of Fascists.! Did you take your meds today?,?
825,Pathetic! A day of prayer for victims while you are still playing legal hardball to avoid accountability is beyond sick.  Educating churchmen that child rape and its cover up is wrong is pointless. Drop the stonewalling games and take care of victims!  Pope Francis is just as much of a fraud as is his Papal Commission.,?
826,Well written and I agree. I rarely agree with mr. Krauthammer but he is right in this analysis.,?
827,Execute that worthless humanity now !!!!!,?
828,Many conservatives pretend to love small government until it comes to the government agents  most likely to come in contact with citizens most often and most likely to detain  imprison or use deadly force on local citizens. Then they give government a blank check.,?
829,LOL FAGS,?
830,yeah  and how much has gone into that?  Less than a couple of %.  The real problem is that Colorado continues to send all the money from the cities to the rural areas.  It is LONG past time for the rural areas to pay a great deal more for THEIR roads  so that the city and burbs does not continue to subsidize those that live in the rural areas.  In fact  I pulled this once before  it was some 30% of the money is taken from the cities to fund rural roads. So  if we stop that  then those that live rural will not have a reason to gripe about cities/suburbs spending 1-2% on bikes  busses  etc.,?
831,Over the next few weeks I will be asking friends if they still plan to vote for Trump. If any of them say yes  I will be surprised because I usually don't hang around with racist  homophobic  pigs.  I have spent some time in various locker-rooms and have never heard anyone suggest they enjoyed sexually assaulting women. His response last night was pure BS.  I would not let that fat orange pig near my house  my family  or our Presidency!,?
832,An extension of the news business today. Turning "news" into a circus  and creating outrage for its own sake.,?
833,It's starting.  Keep watching. Until there's nothing left to watch except Breitbart and RT.  I hope you're all using IP obfuscation because Canada could fall victim to an Anschluß  and our new "Government of Salvation and Protection from Foreign Influences and Bad Hombres" will most certainly request ours from the Globe.,?
834,Make an income tax and many retirees will leave the state for six months and a day. I am sure the income tax will be more than the PFD. When I am  gone I will try to get any expensive medical procedures done also saving more money. All the growth in the Medical Service Business will cease creating even more people fleeing.,?
835,Good observation.  Ginsburg and Sotomayer rule based on their personal beliefs and feelings.  The law is secondary and they apply the law only if it supports their pre-determined conclusions.,?
836,The US is already buried in debt from the first Voodoo economics experiment. Another bought of this disastrous policy  and the US days as a great power will fall into serious question.,?
837,It is and has never been about losing . If the election had been lost to a non traitorous   racist bigot misogynous   possible child raping piece of crap and it had been lost to a person of decency   morals  values and no it didnt have to be Hillary    there would be no complaints . Its the character or lack there of that is why we protest,?
838,Why is it assumed that there is a single good way to teach math?  From my own experience there are some students who "get" math  who can easily juggle numbers and equations in their heads and who can pick up new concepts easily.   For others it may be a struggle that requires step by step instruction.   For both groups  I agree that committing certain basic skills to memory is key  and repeated practice is necessary - if only so one learns to avoid sloppy mistakes that we can all make.    As to textbooks  I've worked through a couple of them  and they've been so dumbed down  with every single step written out to the point where the kids no longer need to think that they make the teaching harder rather than easier.   Solutions will come from tackling all these problems  from better trained teachers who can recognize the students who "get it" to those who need more coaching and step by step guidance  to better textbooks  and a willingness to ensure the fundamentals are ingrained early on,?
839,I wonder if any of these consultants want to become mayor or be on the city council.,?
840,"supporting education"?  I think what you really mean is supporting the teacher's union and the democrat party  which receives funding and operational support from the latter.  This is all about self-interest  not the interests of our children. Keep your pussy-hats to yourselves  thank you.,?
841,Dirty cop Mueller and his band of liberals thugs: An investigation is search of a crime!,?
842,There is a fine lone between stubborn and stupid. Without meeting the federal standards there is a real chance many Alaskans will no longer be able to travel out get to work.  Since the majority of the States have already complied it it very unlikely Alaska will win this battle.,?
843,No "new" evidence.......the original evidence was more then enough to show her character.,?
844,I did "use my brain."  You think someone else wrote it?  The word "idiot" is understood by all and it's in every dictionary out there.  It's not even close to vulgar.  If it bothers your sense of civility  don't read it.     BTW  I notice your reply was deleted because "it did not meet civility standards."  Forgot to use your brain?  HA! HA! HA! HA!,?
845,Probably inadequate fiber in the diet  or a lack of parental guidance.,?
846,Politicians have been after the PFD since its formation  nothing new there  but they are closer to getting it if the public doesn't fight back as they used to. These same politicians are to blame for the devastation to our states' savings over the years  squandered horribly  by them on their pet projects and ignoring the future  incredibly short-sighted. Through their greed and boot-licking of oil industry execs we  the Alaskan public  now pay the price.  So why is nobody speaking of this issue in these terms? Why are we not discussing the future in terms of savings of our oil wealth  which surely is not finished?! I cannot believe the price of oil will not go up again. Let's begin to look at the mistakes of the past  ignore the blame (I personally blame the Republicans for this debacle)  and use that knowledge to forge our future. A future where we need not pay taxes  the government is run from our oil savings  and everyone will enjoy tens of thousands each in annual oil revenue.,?
847,So  Magna CEO Don Walker hands Trump ammo in his attempt to rig NAFTA by suggesting that tougher rules may indeed result in greater auto sector investment in the U.S. Perhaps not surprisingly he fails to mention it will also lead to higher manufacturing costs and higher prices in the showroom. But hell  why worry about that when you're trying to position yourself for a virtual monopoly position by helping Trump to penalize offshore competition  not to mention damage Canada's position  too?,?
848,"Trump called Mexicans murderers and rapists. Those are his words."  No  that's a lie.,?
849,And there are still 8 weeks to go. The stupid  desperate  and ugly is gonna get far worse. Damn she sounds scared. Clinton may be the only woman in the world that can make Trump look and sound presidential. That's scary too......,?
850,Liberal  you are a Hypocrite  Bill Clinton was and is serial abuser and Borderline Ped. and a Convicted Lier. Obama spent millions to keep his life history secret  we don't even who he is yet. O'Reilly and Trump look pretty clean in comparison. Vote the Homer Socialist Out !,?

855,"We liberal elitists......"   I put elitism  racism and bigotry under the same umbrella.  Mr. Keillor's stereotyping  presumptive and elitist attitude is not what America needs.,?
856,Exactly.  It's good to see it's finally starting to sink in.,?
857,Well I'll be damned! I actually agree with Donald Trump 100% this time.....terrorists are  in fact  losers.,?
858,The "wall" would make our government bigger than its ever been. Reagan ran on small government too  then as President  he proceeded to make it bigger than ever. A wall  is nothing but a fantasy and it will never be built.,?

865,Once more you are under the impression that a criminal have right to get away while LEO have no right to hinder that escape. LEO have no reason to yield the road to a criminal in flight. He can stand his ground and deter that escape by any means and that is totally legal under every book in every state in this nation. It is also legal in most nations around the world. So I don't understand why you are whining about something like this. If you don't trust LEOs that is on you and maybe the overhype liberal media that like to paint LEOs as the bad guys and criminals as good guys. Maybe you are projecting such image yourself? In all your comments  you appears to defend the rights of Mr. Tupper to escape and believes that LEOs have no right to hinder that escape. That has been your premise for all your commentaries.,?

877,Actually moving the affable Min. Kent Hehr to a new cabinet position he's best suited for might be doing Min. Hehr a big favour come election time. He has a better chance to make smart choices and make a favourable impression  as Cabinet Minister than in the tough Veteran's Affairs area and he may have a little more time to spend on home turf regurlarly meeting his constituents and therefore a better chance to keep his seat.,?
878,Looks like that's what she thought too dumb   ,?
879,What hypocrites your sources are! They are not worried about any ethical problems or about any danger to national security--only about how to make the oppo  research public without being identified. The only difference between them and Trump Jr. is that the latter is more honest.  IMO  they were absolutely right to hear the Russians out.  What Trump Jr. would have done had it been useful info is strictly an assumption  and we are seeing a lot of confirmation bias here. (The Party Line Press (PLP) always construes any story to the  maximum disadvantage of the President.)  The Trump campaign might have even notified the FBI if it were incriminating info. After all  Hillary was already under investigation ( aka  Comey's whitewash).  Mike Lion  P.S. "Collusion" is not a crime  as some of your readers seem to think.,?
880,Good job Sen. Wilson.... keep up the good work.,?
881,left wing economic and spending stupidity from people like you  is why canada is not great!,?
882,What a load of ridiculous tripe.  Stop trying to conflate the actions of 4 teenagers stupidity to justify your inability to form a cogent answer.  If you wish to defend Trump's position  do so by presenting legitimate arguments based on fact instead of irrelevant rants based on flavour of the day news. Trump won the election  check. Got it  That's the only relevant thing you said.,?

886,No fool like an old fool.  He lied his way into office promising the repeal and replacement of the ACA.  McCain graduated last in his class and only because his old man was a General.  He had no business flying a navy jet and even less being a Republican Senator from the state of Arizona  home of Barry Goldwater.  He obstructed George Bushes tax cuts making them temporary  wrote unconstitutional campaign finance laws and now cements failed socialist insurance subsidies and law into our economy.  We are just lucky he lost to Obama otherwise the borders would be wide open and McCaineCare would be an even worse bipartisan law.  He is a despicable politician who was able to turn his military heroism into a decades long money tree.,?

895,The only comparison I was making between pedophilia and homosexuality is that Jesus doesn't speak about either  the point being that silence does not imply acceptance.    You decided to try and make a distinction with respect to harmfulness  and I replied in kind.  While I might have not mentioned harmfulness of lesbianism (AIDS is primarily a male homosexuality issue)  it doesn't change the fact that homosexuality is  indeed  harmful.,?
896,What fools and idiots.  at least Donald Trump puts America first.  our fool of a PM puts Canada at risk and Canadians last.  Butts need to do a better job of explaining how votes work for little justin - he is just not ready and not capable of leading a country.  justin will never be ready.

908,ezra was the judge handling the forbes cave eddie ayau dust up. he failed to do the appropriate research so thought the NHO had standing with respect to IWI and objects pursuant to the mistaken local notion that the state law and not federal law regulates such objects. as Dr C correctly notes  Nakakuni was fired by Jeff Sessions  partly for taking the local position and not the federal position involving native Hawaiian land use pursuant to the commerce clause.

920,And you too Bones.  I will remember you and call you out too.  I wasn't a fan of Bush but I never vilified him.  He is a good person and wants the best for our country  even if I disagreed with the politics.  Your language along with others here are a result of Gingrich and McConnell and years of cultivating and inciting this divisiveness  name calling and vilification of people who think differently ( and love this country). We share more than we differ.  We need to be able to communicate even if it is difficult conversation.  We need to come to the table and talk. Your comments are not that.,?

927,The article is correct insofar as it points out that an additional dollar of donation to elite universities like Harvard and Yale is purely superfluous.

946,. This is great news for the principals of human rights and participatory democracy.  Those who can  should stand up for these things  and Canada is well-positioned to take a strong stand.

952,Someone needs to smack some sense into that "parent". Seriously  how neglectful are you? I'm willing to speculate that this wasn't the first time that poor child was left alone like that  but it better be the last! What's our mayor have to say in response to this? The tone was set last week when ADN ran the article about the mayor of Fairbanks responding to two children (4 and 6 years old) left in a running  unlocked  vehicle in the Fred Meyer's parking lot!!! Get your head out of your anus!! And before you nay-sayers chastise me for coming off harsh  think about it  what if it was your kid that your [in]-significant other left alone? I hope that child doesn't remember that when they get older too because I'd have a real hard time trusting that "parent" ever again if I was thier kid! STUPID!!!,?

970,"Honolulu passenger failed to raise red flags" . wrong. uskanli raised multiple red flags as indicated in the article.  . it was the failure of authorities and airline employees to recognize the array of red flags uskanli raised and their failure to communicate uskanli's unusual behaviors that allowed this incident to happen.,?

981,I live in central Alberta. At the height of summer it is daylight from about 3:30AM to 11:00PM. Daylight at that hour of night is useless.  I would prefer an advance of 2 hours for the spring  summer  and autumn.,?
982,Gentle reminders??? What is the sentence to be imposed for refusal to use these pronouns again? Everybody gets pretty quiet at that question but until we know that  we wont know just how gentle these reminders truly are. Proponents of this Bill in our Senate likened it all to genocide and in their sneering condescension for those who oppose it based on a lack of scientific credibility  made it quite clear theres a heck of a lot more than "gentle reminders" attached to this Bill.,?
983,I'd prefer my meal without a slew of taxes added onto the tab too.    This is little different.  Like a tax  it's an extra cost to the customer that government is dictating.,?
984,RIP  Higgins. Your memoirs will live on...,?
985,A good article to update the rest of Hawaii about which direction a large employer in this state is taking.  In regard to Southwest coming to Hawaii  there was a lot of noise a few weeks back when SWA sponsored a tourism forum here in Honolulu. It was thought the event was the calling card in which they'd announce service to the islands either during or soon after. Obviously the announcement didn't happen there. I wonder if in further talks with DOT-A and looking at the operational landscape of HNL  OGG and LIH (the three airports I would suspect would receive service off the bat) whether they decided to wait out a bit while DOT-A figures out how to house SWA in HNL with the volume they want to bring to the islands. Foreman is right  if they bring one plane a day here  it isn't going to change fares much. However  SWA has never been known to enter a market with just one flight a day - they flood the market with flights from multiple destinations on day one. That is how they make the $,?

993,its pathetic to think real childish morons  wouldnt want to visit our great neighbor the usa,?
994,OK so you decided to move on  even though you enjoyed your profession. You went and got more education  which probably was not necessary given that you already had a gainful profession. Think of how much you lost in time and money moving on to something else  wasting 10 years at a dead end job that didn't have to be a dead end job. I posit that you would have ended wealthier and more content having the one career and having a reasonable living retirement as well  using that for travel  family time  and self education and reflection.,?

1005,"Inmates are in jail for a reason  and bringing a child  of any age  into an environment with many violent offenders all around sounds like an unsafe and inappropriate situation to me." Does she think the kids show up to play a game of pickup basketball with the general population? Good grief! The only offender they are exposed to is the one related to them. One has to wonder if this woman even has children.  Even a short term jail sentence is a long separation for young children  and the idea that mom or dad doesn't come home because they are in jail is a tough concept  subject to confusion limited only by their imaginations. Keeping or strengthening family ties makes sense  much more sense than keeping them from a building that has scary  bad people they will never actually see.  BTW  Ms. Godfrey  not every inmate is in jail because they actually did something wrong.  We still have this innocent until proven guilty thing.,?

1013,Like the cops  afraid of their shadows? 6th Grade reading  worth $15 000.00 for you policemen who attended college  but flunked 8th grade.  Now Bellingham has agreed to pay Laigaie $15 000 for violating his rights. One can’t help but wonder  however  why the officers were not receiving this training in the first place. Sending you kids to WWU? Check in with the inbreds  scared of their shadows.  Need some tuition money  open carry  and you can get a free grant from you police department  where the only investigation they specialize in is at the Crispy Cream Donut Stop.  http://truthinmedia.com/retired-vet-threatened-by-police-after-legally-carrying-his-gun/,?

1019,Trump is mostly concerned with what he believes is in the interest of Trump.  He campaigned against the Iran deal  so now he feels like he'll look weak if he doesn't scuttle it.  Doesn't really matter to him a bit if it turns out it's really a good deal.  If it's existence makes him look weak  or bad  or ineffective  it's got to go.  Same goes for health care  tax reform and immigration.  Doesn't matter at all what's right or in the best interests of the country  it's all about what he perceives as making himself look effective.,?
1020,Crows were eating all my dogs' food. Couldn't get rid if them. So i shot one at the dish and left him there. The crows just lined the roof of the house  the woodshed and the neighbor's house and raised hell for about a half hour. Then they flew to the power lines out front for a little while before flying off  never to return. To the dogs' chagrin  I left that crow in the yard for a few days as a reminder in case they returned. Crow problem ended...,?
1021,The south rebelled in part because they feared a bloody slave revolt.  Haiti had just had a slave revolt where they killed every white and many mulatto.  Only those cornered in a port city survived.  The north was going to cause a similar slave revolt with all the propaganda.  Today we live the violence from blacks every day.  The South was right.,?
1022,Very disappointed in Linda.  At which point does our government step in and stop illegal behavior by those who chose to violate the rights of land owners when those living in camps have numerous other options?  It's gotten to the point the Mayor is doing his job  although not appreciated by some. Granted people not camping on others' property might have their  lifestyle choices affected.  Some of those homeless may need serious help with addictions while others refuse that help.,?
1023,It is the second generation of immigrant Muslims who are most likely to become Islamist jihadist radicals. In 20 years the  children of these women will want to kill other Canadians  and fight for Allah.,?
1024,Morneau's words completely contradict what the experts say who know what risks taxpayers will actually face and what everyone is warning this idiotic government about.  The Liberals will probably plow this through much like the faulty Phoenix payroll system they were told wasn't quite ready and to hold off deploying....... by why listen to reason when the idiot voters don't react much when they triple their deficits.  Blowing $25 - $30 billion annually is acceptable for Liberals but be damned if we allow a $1.9 billion surplus go through by the Conservatives.,?
1025,You can resign  but you can't hide  you disgusting heap of excrement. Just another one for the Treason Trials. I wonder how much stolen money this lying  incompetent cadre is personally responsible for. I've already booked my front seat to watch how these conniving thieves are finally brought to book. And I also wonder if there'll be enough room in the dock for all of them?,?
1026,GET OVER IT!!!!!! IT WAS AN EFFING JOKE!!!! Quit being so damn hyper sensitive.   YES  it was funny... It was funny because MOST nurses are indeed FEMALE! FACT. When I hear the word "NURSE" I  and statistically 100% of other human beings picture the woman with the white dress and hat. THATS HOW IT IS. DEAL WITH IT!  2) Statistically 100% of straight men WOULD NOT want gay men OOGLING their genitals and "admiring" them. FACT. That is NOT "Anti-Gay"... Its just FACT. I certainly would not want some gay guy checking out my private parts...   And you Leftists wonder why we cant stand you guys... You are NITPICKERS!!! You take apart EVERY DAMN sentence and analyze EVERY word... You take the fun out of EVERYTHING.   MAGA 2020.,?

1036,The tail end of the article says it all...how will if be reinforced?  If you look at the real problem it drills down the the individuals who lack being responsible and using common courtesy.  If non-compliance for the sake of others how about your own safety?  I don't get it.  Perhaps this is simply a carry over from their behavior on the roadway or how about shopping at Costco?  :)  Just saying...,?
1037,"The call to live with Christ-like integrity" Well  why the entire Catholic Institution clergies starting with Pope F. and all his clergies except a few hide behind Vatican like 'The Tower of Babel' being silent about the clergy sex abuse of children!   Where are their 'Christ-like integrity'?  Can any of you religious preach who keep their mouth shut at the clergy raped children's suffering  this 'Christ-like integrity'? Even the cats & dogs will laugh at your religious hypocrisy!!!!!!!!  You CI clergies and religious really do not believe in the LIVING God  Christ  Holy Mary  Saints & Angels to ignore the suffering clergy raped children!!!  LOLOLOLOLOL!,?

1041,Wysiwyg asked if the Supreme Court of Canada suggested a Federal government settlement  and they did.  Not an actual dollar figure  of course  nor do they ever. After setting out the Charter violations  the SCC said that it was going to "allow Mr. Khadr’s application for judicial review in part and to grant him a declaration advising the government of its opinion on the records before it which  in turn  will provide the legal framework for the executive to exercise its functions and to consider what actions to take in respect of Mr. Khadr  in conformity with the Charter."  That was a proceeding in which Khadr had been trying to get the Harper Government to request his return to Canada.  The lawsuit for damages hadn't reached the trial stage yet  but the 2010 finding of multiple Charter violations settled the main issue of it. (other allegations were added later.)  The Harper government  as we know  ignored the Court.  Next time you want me to do your homework  try minimal politeness.,?
1042,Anchorage's mail-in voting system is neither new  nor has it "effectively disenfranchised voters."  In fact  the mail-in type of ballot is the ONLY reason I vote.,?
1043,Typical liberal 'justice'.  Defend the baby killers and peddlers of fetus body parts and demonize those who dare to expose the vile enterprise.  Judgement Day is coming and the ultimate justice will prevail.,?
1044,What a bunch of crooks.,?
1045,"My theory is that the culprit was corporate greed."  But of course it is!  That's the fundamental tone at NCR.   The cause has nothing to do whatsoever with the secular view that "pain is evil" and it must be dashed away with chemicals from the first moment.    We are intolerant to pain.  We're soft.  We go to doctors that hand these things out...we whine  we complain..we sue at the slightest provacation.  "Irreparable harm  blah  blah  blha.  Yada whine Yada.   It's our fault.,?

1052,Have you walked around Denver lately   or Civic Center Park ? These poor homeless people are pigs !,?
1053,Okay  I don't get it.  If you're a City Councillor with the respect of your fellow representatives  why would you need to ask for their endorsements? Wouldn't they just offer to support one of their own if they thought he or she had what it takes to be Mayor? The fact that no-one on the Council has stepped up to support Mr. Clark is a big  red flag.  Mr. Clark's voting record shows disregard for the homeless and complete ignorance on the relationship of economic development to environmental health.  I want a Mayor that can bridge entrenched political silos; a person that reaches out to hear all sides. A Mayor with demonstrated skills bringing diverse interests together and a robust understanding of the complex issues facing us as a community.  That doesn't take political experience on  Council!  I'm thinking Lucy Vinis has what it'll take.,?

1058,Trump's a criminal. The Republican party has a treason problem. Freedom-loving Americans are growing tired of the Republican party and will punish the sociopaths who run it. When Trump makes the move toward authoritarianism  Americans will stop it.  These degenerates think America is their toilet and they can just do their business in our faces. We bust back.,?
1059,"We should keep our noses out of it  except as it affects Canadian citizens and residents."  Have you read the paper today?  There may be an interesting story developing about how fanning the flames of xenophobia and racism could affect certain people in Quebec.,?
1060,That has to be the dumbest reply to a comment I have ever read  but TY.,?
1061,My comment shows up here  but I've pasted it below in case you're curious.  "more explicit terms"? Mean-spirited  pejorative  and ignorant of the diversity in the homeless population all come to mind. We can help our fellow citizens without disparaging them.,?
1062,There were many residents that did not want the City Hall torn down.  All nearby cities-Springfield  Corvallis  New Albany  Cottage Grove have City Halls that were older and are still there.   If the actual cost had been known  the Eugene City Hall   would not have been torn down.   Who even knows what the final cost will be-about 8 million was the last figure that the RG gave  for a now empty lot.  That does not include rent for services spread out through the city and the on-going costs of the land swap...much less the actual rebuilding costs.,?
1063,Nobody mentions the content of the emails because they were mostly deathly dull.  There was no mafia like activity  however many times you say that.  Chelsea Clinton was called spoiled and there was lots of dealing by the Democratic PARTY to get Sanders out of the race in favour of the loong time Dem established  candidate  Clinton.    Big whoop  And in any case  it doesn't matter because the concern is how unfit the Donald is to hold the highest office in the US.,?
1064,Lets just end this dog and pony show. No sense to drag it out and continue draining state funds to pay per diem and operating costs. It's clear that a majority of legislators are not willing to do anything this year to really help the state's future. They lessened criminal penalties and tried to reform Medicaid spending that will likely have minimal savings. Besides those couple of things nothing much constructive to help our fiscal situation.,?
1065,At Orbitz and Expedia it still is HNL. I prefer it that way. Inouye must be irritated. He didn't like being a show off. Stupid time-wasting ideas by idiots who have nothing better to do. Just like Cayetano and his tunnel renaming idea.,?
1066,Of course it was a racial deal in your eyes.  Always the 2017 view of the world from YewGene is that all problems are race based.  And the guy was angry so he was thrown on the heap of "angry white guys."  Yes!   The Trump voters!   Afraid that he won and has  four years to govern?   The Deplorables.  White Deplorables.  Those racist White Deplorables.   Eugene Bigot   a Blue Voter.   Ever think it was just another drunk with not a lick of sense and race had zero to do with it?,?
1067,That's you worthless opinion  the people who voted for Trump are the same ones who expose TARP fund misappropriations by Obama and co  also Awan's misdealings (he's a Pakistani criminal who managed to gain access to over 80 DNC officials' computers)  or Obama's secret funding of ISIS in Syria (that program ended last week)  It would seem the people who are ignorant on geopolitics are the ones who need a slap in the brain...,?

1083,This whole hypocrite talk is anoying to me. Would you tolerate a woman in bikini answering your about your income tax problem? Why do you tolerate a burka? It's not tolrated to see a guy whit tatoo and rocker style delivering driver license. Why is it if he wears a cross or a turban? Both organisation have been found guilty of crime true out history.   It's a job  dress properly to respect other. Live your private life after work. End of story. Your right to beleive in whatever is limited by the right of other not to be ofended by this vision of historical war  crime  violence  domination  child abuse  genocide  terrorism and such that your vestment represent.  I am deeply offended  when a religious display his sign to me. I dont see faith or beleif. I only see miss trust and potential influence that lead to human crime every time. I have right too. And i dont want to be reminded of child abuse or genocide  when dealing whit my gouvernement.,?
1084,Here come the disaffected children of these refugees.  Their response will likely be similar to the children of the Muslim refugees in France and Germany.  And we will suffer.   What a stupid idea to bring these people to Canada  to live in poverty  and then we'll likely get the ISIS treatment from their children beginning in a few years.,?
1085,HabFan410 - both sides can say they oppose racism but Trump has a long history of it.  Refusing to rent to blacks  outright racist statements against them  Mexicans and others  a campaign to delegitimize Obama as not born in America  stoking outrage against black youth accused (and acquitted) of rape - Trump is one ugly hombre on this matter and those cheering him on  I suspect  share many of his shortcomings.,?
1086,The "brain drain" usually refers to scientists  engineers  etc  not assembly line workers.,?
1087,Wonderful reflective prose from a sensitive Baby Boomer perspective.  The Boomer experience will always be burdened with the guilt of having failed to live up to it's transformative potential  and leaving a bit of a mess for future generations  but will find solace in that it's merely the destiny of a generation as does each generation have it's own collective experience.

1092,Miss? I don't watch. Apparently you can't tell the difference between consensual sex  sexual assault and rape.  Or maybe you just don't care.  Trump wasn't POTUS preying upon a young intern. Maybe you can provide evidence that Trump paid out $850 000.00 to settle a sexual harassment suit like WJC did to Paula Jones.   Hillary is a dishonorable LIAR!  Hillary's Bold Lie: Her Omission That She Was FIRED From Her Staff Position on the House Judiciary Committee to Impeach President Nixon As a 27 year-old staff attorney for the House Judiciary Committee during the Watergate investigation  Hillary Rodham was fired by her supervisor  Democrat Jerry Zeifman. When asked why Hillary Rodham was fired  Zeifman said in an interview  "Because she was a liar.

1096,The Liberals were given a strong mandate? Are you on crack?   The Conservatives have 99 seats  that hardly gives your party a "strong" mandate. And with your Captain Moonbeam and all of his broken promises I hope Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition continues to put the screws to them! You get over it and let Parliament on the Westminster system do it's job. The liberals whinning about proper procedure is pathetic.,?
1097,When you were a kid we didn't have an idiot for a president.,?
1098,All Leonard does is hate. And the left loves and praises him for it. Pathetic  really.,?
1099,KeyStone XL was a no-brainer  but it was lost on the "environmental" President who was in office while 10 new pipelines were built in the U.S.  Obama is a feckless  hypocritical pinhead.,?
1100,evidently nicknaylor is incapable of learning how stupid he and his hero are.,?
1101,How does it affect people who use sign language?,?
1102,Honestly  10 000+ is too many  but its location is one of the best spots for an entertainment venue. I sits in an industrial area far from any residents (750m from island). The old port is contaminated so it will be years before residences are built  if ever. Why not turn the area into a nightclub district? Add some more TTC buses fridays and saturdays and let partiers run wild in a derelict area instead of downtown!?,?
1103,Damn Kyra Bodnar  that protest sign though! Why *aren't* they all this pretty?!!?  That's a really brilliant way to convey your message in a positive but not submissive way.,?
1104,If the DNC did not rig the leadership race against Bernie I don't think Trump would be POTUS today. How many disgusted Bernie supporters voted?,?
1105,Rand is the only one who cares about the constitution and the American people.  The rest are establishment shills.   They can go to hell.,?
1106,There were a number of long-term "Alaska First" moderate Republicans and independents -building the Backbone group - Don't disparage well-known and respected Alaskans who have been living here and active as leaders here as in both parties long before you blithely decided to belittle them.,?
1107,He should be hung for treason.,?
1108,Fire the idiot and pull his pension - utterly disgraceful.,?
1109,Like (ex)Chief Kealoha?,?
1110,Ha!  If this guy is sincerely bummed that his party no longer seems to be "helping Democrats beat Republicans"  he probably hasn't checked the scoreboard in a while.  Only ONE Republican state senator out of 25.  Only 7 Republican state representatives out of 51.  The governorship is Democrat.  All four mayors play for the donkey team.  Pretty much every member of the four county councils.  The entire congressional delegation.  Perhaps Civil Beat lets its friends play fast and loose with spin doctoring while the facts speak otherwise.  But  come on!!  Nobody actually expects Hawaii's GOP to make any inroads in 2016.  If anything  the GOP might lose a seat or two on November 8th.  Now  if this story was about Republicans quitting the state and county Republican party committees because the RINO party leaders showed no interest in "helping Republicans beat Democrats" then you would DEFINITELY have a story.  But this story was SO DUMB that I now feel less intelligent for having read it.,?
1111,At this point I am not convinced anything could stick on him.  The man could get caught having sex with a goat and blow it off and no one would care.  Except the goat....,?
1112,The fact that you insist to put  millions at in dire risk for China and an American company - is not only treason - it's delusional and insane. Are you a sociopath?,?
1113,Must suck to be so insecure that one is threatened by love between two human beings  how human beings identify etc,?
1114,As an alumni and former player at Highlands Ranch  this behavior is absolutely intolerable. The single most important thing that my coaches preached to us was how to be better men through the lessons that football taught us. Stuff like being early to meetings  being accountable to your teammates  staying positive in the face of adversity. This action taken by the Head coach is despicable and not what someone in a position of mentorship should ever even consider. Good riddance.,?
1115,Be damned  about the first Hammer piece I agree with. Even he is frightened.,?

1119,You are free to like the enslavement of blacks  too. Kaepernick knows people like you exist. That's why he's doing what he's doing--to bring awareness that your kind exists. He's doing a pretty good job  isn't he. I bet before he did it  he said  this ought to bring racist Republicans out of the woodwork.,?
1120,And if you ever decide to shoot your family or neighbors. you have nothing to buy.,?

1123,Hard to take people seriously when they claim to be against corruption and yet do everything they can to distract people away from the real corruption going on in the Democratic Party and the media.,?
1124,WE:  Could easily say the same thing about you  hypocrite!,?
1125,Maybe this idiocy will finally get her voted out of office.,?
1126,The name of the new comment forum is entitled "Civil".  Try it  it works.  No need for "are you sure you read it".  Sarcasm is unnecessary.  Several comments - I finally got a conservative friend admit that the "cartel" you people are so concerned about are actually Civil Service employees who have worked for the government for years.  The little gamesmanship that so many conservatives like to play is rather humorous.  Secondly  the pitfalls of having a balanced budget amendment are significantly worse than any legislation.  What's Buck excuse? In Chapter 12 he claims that the only reason a balanced budget amendment fails in Congress is because everyone is interested in getting re-elected.  No  the failure of the legislative process is the realization that a balanced budget amendment itself has too many inherent problems.  All you characters need to do what the opposition party did in 2010 - pass a bill knowing it might cost re-election.,?
1127,They kill babies,?

1129,It's not terrorism no matter what the terrorist says.,?
1130,I disagree. Was the Canadian embassy ( Canada House) in London purpose built? How about the American Native Museum in New York City? I think (as a taxpayer with a huge respect for indigenous people) that this proposal offers several opportunities that can be enhanced to meet all the criteria. Will everyone be happy? No  but with a bit of work I think it can be a building that everyone can be pleased with.,?

1139,there is a nuance between the two. Nazi and Communists  to hard to explain in a comment. Stay clear of both and silently ignore them. They go away after they implode. Honestly  as not heroic as it is  the best is to move from cities/states/countries that elect these idiots. Vote with your feet. They always implode after they take power  no point in your being there to suffer with them. Look at Venezuela.,?

1141,look what happened to Yogi bear If you don't want to lose your picnic baskets don't leave them on the picnic table...Now he's just BooBoo's b*tch.,?
1142,For example:  Take a drive some day down the Cape Shore road on the eastern side of Placentia Bay.  There are about a half dozen old outports between Placentia and St. Brides.  Not only are all of them at 50 to 200 m above sea level on steep hills or on top of cliffs above the shoreline  none of them have wharfs or fishing sheds remaining at the shoreline because they fished out of the government wharfs at Placentia or St. Brides since the 70s.  And of course most people living in these outports now have jobs in Placentia or St. Brides  or run their own businesses  or are retired older folks.  And they have no reason to move.  Again  if you would read the study you posted  it says that what is most at risk from rising sea levels are things at sea level -- wharfs and fishing sheds  breakwaters and beach roads.  It doesn't say outports are at risk because they aren't.  Some outports may be at risk  or maybe just their wharf if they still have one  while others are at no risk at all.,?
1143,Stop the mine! You will kill the fish before we get to kill them. Haha  predatory fishing industry is so hypocritical.,?
1144,The ACLU is just as bad as the SPLC.  Both used to be respectable.  Now both are extreme Left and insane.,?

1147,I'm not the one whose rant filled up two comment sections  ill.,?
1148,PR is a joke bud    its based on the stupidity that thinks people are not represented in government just cause the candidate they voted for didnt win and that is just pure left wing BS!  ,?
1149,Boots  so you're calling your democratic party in Hawaii Socialists. Hmmm  interesting.  The Hypocrisy is you. lol,?
1150,If you're saying the people who voted for Trump are stupid  I already know that.  So does most of the world. The sad thing is they're too stupid to know they're stupid.,?
1151,"the number of arrests of undocumented immigrants has risen sharply under Trump."  That's what laws are for.,?
1152,In a "right to work" state where employees have little to no recourse (excepting for harassment)  that's about all anyone can do. It's kind of pathetic.,?
1153,43.5 million for 500 hundred A/C units  are you stupid  crazy  or getting a cut? C'mon stop BSn us!,?
1154,Seriously bycatch? What an arrogant and self-serving position.,?
1155,Geez  how stupid can people be! Both Hillary and Trump are poor candidates for our President! AMERICA has never been great. That's just PR! A country that doesn't uphold the Constitution  people's Civil Rights  the First Amendment  protect the environment  provide jobs  healthcare  affordable housing for its citizens  equal taxation  etc  isn't great! But we always have that possibility. But not with Trump or Hillary.,?
1156,This was my house asshole n my dad was heating our house to have heat for my 3yr old son.No ones house besides our was touched by fire.The generator was outside but the exhaust was to close to the wall(no one told him it had to be a certain amount of feet away.It wasn't right up to it.It was away from everything but close enough for a spark from the exhaust to catch the house on fire that was old and dry wood)of the EMPTY house(other side of duplex from the one we lived in that was being upgraded for my son and I to move into)the pot grow had NOTHING to do with the fire.Weather we had a grow light on or not the fire still would of happened.Say they didn't mention the grow part would you care that a 3yr old boy is now homeless n lost EVERYTHING in a fire caused by a generator that was RENTED because the ice store had made us loose power n we were trying to keep my son warm.Fuck everyone n there judgements.This was no ones fault.i hope u all have a great xmas with your family.,?
1157,Yet another public display of leftist hate and violence.    Lacking courage of their convictions they disguise themselves to thwart identification and subsequent reprisal from employers and neighbors.  Cowards  thugs  fascists  they are the real threat to society.  Trudeau's base.,?
1158,You are seriously over the line here. I'm not going to flag it and I hope others do not either. People need to see this foolishness. Throwing around the label "terrorists" is irresponsible  nasty  and reminiscent of the garbage I grew up with in the McCarthy era when folks got branded "communists" blacklisted  spit on and ruined for NO thing.,?
1159,Then you fail utterly at a really  really pathetic hobby.  Not possible for you to 'goad' me.  I don't take you seriously enough for that.,?
1160,Having Game of Thrones fantasies today?,?
1161,Christy Clark  April 2017: "Leadership I think demands that we be clear about where we stand  that we be principled and stick with what we believe in  and that we be consistent in fighting for that. I just have never believed that politicians or that societies are better when politicians hide what they believe or try to be all things to all people. If you stand for something  you should have the guts to say it."  If all the parties support the same ideas  then if comes down to confidence in the principles of leader. Clearly  Clark doesn't measure up to her own yardstick.  Since all parties agree  then Clark will have to support in Opposition. Toothless  if Clark strays away from supporting these policies   she loses even more credibility.  None of the new policies from Clark's Throne Speech have been worked through for consensus from the party but rather Clark highjacked the party platform and proclaimed a new one from on high.  Can't have confidence in Clark.,?
1162,Talk about dumb women----they were supposed to get organized and march BEFORE the election   rather than cry like sore losers after it's over .  The funny part is millions of women voted for Trump   and helped him become or 45 th president.   Adding to the dumbness   in D.C. the organizers there told all women who are pro life to not show up .  They are excluding their own sisters because they don't like they're position on abortion. How pathetic is that ?  All those who march in D.C. support killing the nearly born through abortion. Talk about a sick group .The bottom line is these marches will mean nothing . Locally this march will mean even less.  All these women would be better off to hold a bake sale and give all the money to Planned Parenthood who's about to lose all federal funding. They could also use the money to buy birth control so they don't have to kill the innocent nearly born in the first place.  Marches like this make women look second class  uninformed and like losers.,?
1163,You're right about the uncivil comments. That's par for the course these days in social media. However ADN has the right to groom its content as it sees fit. (That's the corporation exercising its First Amendment rights) I'm guessing that a Fox News outlet would have its own Sturmabteilung. Red Shirts?,?
1164,With every stupid  ill considered  insulting joke parsed for racism  it makes real racism easier to dismiss and ignore.,?

1166,Thank you  worthless court system  for putting an attempted murderer back on the streets for a measly $17 000 bail bond.  Really  judge?  How about we release him and let him stay in YOUR HOUSE.  Vote EVERY one of these pathetic judges out when the next election comes up !!!  Open the closed prison back up and GET THESE VIOLENT CRIMINALS OFF THE STREETS !!!,?
1167,Rubbish. Like most anti Western shills you totally disregard the role of Turkey  the Saudis  and Sunni fundamentalist groups.,?
1168,wtf ... ?,?
1169,There's no even concensus yet in the US intelligence community. The report in question was from the DIA. Others  including the CIA  NSA  ODNI etc have not said they agree with the DIA assessment  at least not yet.,?
1170,Oysters are a treat! Quite honestly I don't see anything wrong with eating eggs with sugar! I put sugar on my shredded wheat with strawberries! I agree that those who do not like the show  go and find something that you do like and let us fans make our comments here! I love the show and look forward to each episode! I have the dvd's that I purchased from Discovery Store and really enjoy watching these episodes over and over again! 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍,?
1171,Sorry  I thought you were talking about a different comment.  Here are a few for you.  You can easily google them for source and details. * He appears to have a fragile  impetuous  childish ego ” Brzezinski said * Morning Joe regular Donny Deutsch. ...He’s a vulgar pig * MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” talked about fecal matter for nearly two minutes on Thursday morning when Joe Scarborough compared Trump to “a kid pooping his pants.” * In a brief tirade on 'Morning Joe' today  Joe Scarborough ...”Donald Trump doesn’t know anything about anything” * It's not the first time Scarborough has given a harsh assessment of Tillerson. In May  he compared the secretary of State to [Trump’s] golf caddy and called him "sad and pathetic." * Joe Scarborough ...On his most recent show  the former Republican congressman suggested Trump was deranged ,?

1174,You can blame reality tv for this fool's misadventure. Hope he goes back to NY or Russia.,?
1175,History is a odd thing. Remember it  and the seeds of past mistakes tempt the hateful  unwary  and uneducated. Forget it  and everyone is doomed to repeat it.  Why not gather up all the monuments and statues and put them in the "Big Ol' Museum of Mistakes and Horrors"  complete with historical information about each of them  and their consequences had they not been defeated?  Remember everything. Forget nothing. Consider it all. Know the consequences. Never let it happen again.,?

1179,You are wrong and an idiot! They are not! Americans are. Canadians are not.,?
1180,That's a misinterpretation.  There are many states that have "concealed carry" permits  but you don't need a permit to open carry.  The permit is only if you want to conceal it  i.e.  a permit to wear a coat while you're carrying your gun.  The 2nd Amendment right to carry a weapon "shall not be infringed." There is no equivocation in "shall not.",?

1185,Refugees are not citizens and have no rights  get over it lefties.,?
1186,Sadly  the damage has already been done. This manipulation of the democratic process has probably alienated millennials from the Democratic Party for years to come and may well have installed a weaker candidate in this critical election for the future of our nation. If there's any justice in this world  the DNC super delegates will consider this abuse of the democratic process and HRC's poor polling numbers V tRump in the critical swing states as reason to make Bernie Sanders the party's nominee.,?
1187,Sunwing is still flying guests to Varadero this week.   This will go well for everyone involved  I'm sure.,?

1190,Your right they have to make the the right choice...they must hire a big name coach which would give the program immediate interest to recruits and serve notice that Oregon is not going anywhere.,?
1191,An Australian friend explained the referendum on the Monarchy a few years ago - you needed to win a majority of the votes cast  of a majority of potential votes  in a majority of all states...it obviously did not pass...  Not always the "best" way to do it  but it prevents s few places (Sydney  Melbourne) from running the show.  Which is why any change to Canada's voting system should be subject to something similar - including the proviso of a "super majority" - that is the winning total should be over say 60%...and that the vote total has to be at least 80% of potential votes...(and if you disagree  don't complain about the Liberals or Conservatives only being elected by 24% of the potential voters...)  Something David Cameron should have considered on the Brexit vote...  Anyway  do not look for any surprises from the US Electoral college...,?
1192,(replying to your post  to repost one to the moron Giacomo I can't get the reply block to open on his again after this one was flagged by the moron)  If they reproduce even faster than their already unnatural man-made rates of 3-4 times a year  you just buy more bullets and go on cat-killing patrols more often until every last one is dead. It worked where I live and I've not seen even ONE "breeding faster" cat in over 8 years. They can't breed faster when there aren't any to breed at all.,?
1193,Poor Sean.  He's like a guy who tries to cover up for a family member addicted to meth.  I'm looking forward to the day that he breaks down in sobs during a press conference and comes clean that his boss is a paranoid schizophrenic.   Kellyanne  of course  shares her meth stash with Trump.,?
1194,And yet riel she has been to Allepo four times now.  Has this author ever been there?  I get it you are low effort and feel the need to believe the world is good vs evil.  Guess what it is merely shades of grey when it comes to Foreign or domestic powers.  There are NO good guys but there are lots of dupes.,?
1195,Interesting to see in the pictures that before Mass is social time and not prayer time. Why not save social time for after Mass and use before Mass to prepare yourself spiritually in prayer?,?
1196,It should be four years of hard labor. Four years seems like a short time for being a traitor.,?
1197,Nothing.  It still exists.  But  because there are still people in this country who believe it's their "personal freedom" to discriminate against others  there are laws in place that prohibit such discrimination.  Sadly  it has to be that way.  When one individual's idea of "personal freedom" denies what someone is entitled to just like everyone else  then that ideology hurts others.  If others are being harmed by someone's idea of personal freedom  then those being hurt need protection.  Anti-discrimination laws provide that protection.  Those who violate anti-discrimination law reap the consequences.  Remember  true freedom for citizens in this country includes everyone  not just those you like.,?
1198,Not a chance.  The more he opens his mouth (Trump)  the further he drops.  At the rate his stupidity in tweeting is going  he will be out of office before the end of March 2017.,?
1199,Trump is a complete waste of skin. He's an insult to the American populace and to free people the world over. The sooner he's removed from office the better of all countries are.,?

1209,The Fireweed  and the cache are the ones I liked the best. ADN  are you going to post the winner of the poll?,?
1210,So denglish in your world the white race deserves no culture and should be appropriated by oppressed cultures but never the other way around.  Nice.  "Write what you know" is no where near akin to Gnothi Seaton (Know Thyself) on the temple.  If it was you would have to arrive at a shameless victim who refuses to acknowledge the atrocities of my own ancestors  history (ex. caste system) but only wants to focus on the ones by those that ended up more successful.     So let us flood your shores  while you shut up and give us preferential treatment because we are victims...or if not us  our great great grandfathers were.     That about it?   If real racism rears its ugly head than we should ALL put a stop to it...but your victimhood for perceived sleights has grown tired...so move back to where you came from (not you personally) or continue with your appropriation of white culture (you know the one where the worlds oppressed rushes to) while putting a cork in it.    Sick of whiners.,?
1211,She raped a child... prison for life....,?
1212,"Swamping" Siran? As in  anyone who disagrees with your perspective? Pathetic.,?
1213,"Tell me  are hermaphrodites included in your claim that "you are your body?"Yep. Why wouldn't they be? Because western doctors believe they should be mutilated at birth due to a harmless mutation? What a strange question for you to ask. What I'm saying is no one should have to fit into a box  but you are saying the opposite.  "And why have homosexual tendencies been observed in toddlers too young to know anything about sex?" What exactly is a "homosexual tendency" if it doesn't involve sex?  " And how is rational thinking based on evidence  and believing we should respect all of God's children  sexist? " Does "respecting" all people include mutilating them to fit sex stereotypes? Coulda fooled me.  Sexism involves institutionalized discrimination based on one's sex  neutral biological fact that is assigned social meaning at birth  like race.  Please look up the word sex. It is not the same as gender. I'm sorry you're too ignorant to know that.,?
1214,"I don't see anything here about Russian collusion with the Trump campaign."  Yet... and I doubt we'll have long to wait for several reasons: - the three who are charged worked very closely together. That means each will have intimate knowledge of the others' activities. - they will be questioned separately and won't know what the others have already revealed. This will create a good deal of anxiety for each one and a strong incentive to be first with the truth. - Trump is bold as brass. If anyone would be careless in his actions  it is he  the epitome of conceit. I bet we'll see impeachment initiated before Christmas.,?
1215,the pipeline fiasco of last year  - Obama was never cast in a pejorative light as is trump though what Obama did was in bad faith,?
1216,Read your right-wing  alt-right fishwraps...even they acknowledge that 17 intelligence agencies agree that Russia interfered...you all are just afraid of a reasonable conclusion that there were enough idiots down there to believe the bull**** that the Ruskies put out and vote for Agent Orange instead of the less-horrible option...,?
1217,Interesting. Thanks. So public lands logging is profitable to private parties because of what are  effectively  federal subsidies? Is that it?   Kind of like the subsidies paid to corn growers in the Midwest? The farmers I knew back there told me straight up that  w/out the subsidies they wouldn't even break even.,?

1233,As a supporter of the American enterprise I am astound at their stupidity (let alone lack of morality) in dealing with the Kurds. The Kurds hold an unconditional allegiance to the West and have instituted a form of government that is closer to a democracy than any other government of the surrounding shitholes (Iran  Iraq  Syria and Turkey). American support for them is a smart and moral imperative.,?
1234,So you believe in pedophilia? Mohammed's favorite wife was 9 years old. Many Muslims marry 8 year olds  their parents sell them. They can believe in anyone else or anything else if it doesn't harm people. What Muslims believe is harming people.,?

1257,Your major peer review paper has been published in a respected journal and is forced to include a rebuttal in its appendix since the paper is so poorly written.... here is a quote of the rebuttal...  "While fair criticism is essential to the scientific method and the advancement of knowledge  unfair criticism undermines the scientific method and presents unhelpful information masquerading as knowledge. This review blends fair and unfair criticisms  a dangerous combination because the fair criticisms lend unwarranted credibility to the unfair criticisms. We do appreciate the opportunity to respond to these criticisms  however  particularly those that Besharov and his colleagues repeat from other sources to which we have never directly replied. In a good story that may even be true  B. F. Skinner is said to have retorted to a persistent questioner  “Science progresses by standing on the shoulders of those who have gone before. But you sir  are standing on my feet.”,?

1260,I agree that part of the reason that more money is spent on research here is because we have more people and can afford it easier   That would also be one of the reasons that China is increasing spending.   Part of the reason we are decreasing the spending is because everybody is freaking out about the cost of healthcare.   The money for research has to come from somewhere.,?
1261,What has happened to Bill Morneau this past week pinpoints why most wealthy people will not  go into politics.  With jealous people constantly hounding the ones who do  they have to ask themselves: "Why would anyone want to put up with that kind of aggravation in his or her life?",?

Why does SA hijack my morning news when I pay for the news  not their stupid popups!!! Want me to read the latest notification  put it on top and I'll click on it if I want the information.,?
1268,"Opiod poisoning"? First opiods are not definded as poison.  If you take the street version or the rx version you have the potential to die from them.  Are rx beta blockers poison  the potential to die from them exists? No....opiods are drugs and mostly people take the street version made in China.  They get too much while using them for a craving.  People using them are usually addicts.  Treatment for them includes rehab...big time rehab.  Drs are not to blame and safe injection sites do little more than delay death.  Rehab prevents death  getting dealers off the street reduces availability as does cutting off chinese supply.  Less deaths and lower crime rates will follow rehab!!!! It is not poison....venom is poison!  Get this clear...the people using these are addicts.,?
1269,Nowhere to get information  huh? There is this thing called the internet. It contains the entire wealth of knowledge of all mankind's experience  and it is available free to everyone  no questions asked  at your local library. And don't you dare tell me some crap about "digital divide" or that not every child has access to the internet. I haven't seen a teenager without a web enabled device in almost a decade. Surely planned parenthood has a website.,?

Oh the lies  the lies and more lies.   The Minister must have fired Davids because of the GuptaLeaks but Athul Gupta said on BBC last night that there is no factual proof that these are real!!

1279,I don't have a problem with this but I can think of better uses for their talents.  Like making mittens  scarfs  etc for those who need them more than the trees.,?
1280,If I read correctly  100 of those new jobs will be professional office jobs.  That means the other 1400 jobs are low-level unskilled physical labor paying barely above minimum wage.    The major problem with the slow recovery over the past decade is not the number of new jobs  but the fact there are not enough quality career jobs.  How many more college graduate box fillers does the US really need?  Too many workers are already underemployed with little or no advancement opportunity.,?
1281,While we're at it  why not ban cars as well...? There are so many abandoned cars in our streets and highways these days that are more of an eyesore and present added dangers when driving.... Where is the litter patrol on this issue? Surely they can see the problem...,?
1282,These jerks were in possession of thousands of dollars of stolen vehicles.  They face multiple felony and misdemeanor criminal counts with more likely to follow.  They have turned dozens of good citizens into 'victims.'  One is released on $750 bail and the other. on $1 500 (it doesn't say if it was cash or signature but at that price who cares as it is such a pittance).  I am convinced after this that these two will commit no further crimes while 'out' on their bail - - - YEAH RIGHT!   Do you really want to know what is wrong with our Judicial system???  Look no further than this case and these bonds !!!  I have repeatedly said we have not needed new laws since God wrote the first 10  that what we "have" needed is better judicial enforcement.  For decades now  one of the primary problems in our criminal justice system has been with enforcement by the Judges.  Voters- - - PLEASE remember this Judge come election time!,?
1283,A party leader must be attractive to a large spectrum of voters in order to catch a significant part of the seats and I'm not even talking about winning the election...  Such "exotic" leader will surely attract the hardcore supporters of multiculturalism and the most convinced leftists but what about the ordinary Canadians of the working class?...   I am sure he is a decent and respectable man but does he represent the ordinary Canadians and the working class  or the urban elite  his own religious community and the multicultural ideologues?...,?

1288,I want the galloping buffoon out of the White House so badly I can taste it  but this isn't news.   It's not like he's the first person to ever misspell a word in an internet post.  We're not going to save our country from this elitist bigot by making fun of his spelling.  Be better than this  journalists.,?
1289,When I was younger I was a social activist  volunteering a lot of time in various endeavors that would likely today be deemed to be leftist causes. But I was always uncomfortable with the pressure to conform to a broader social thesis that was largely founded in grievance and complaint while I preferred a more functionalist approach (i.e. let's look at the specific problem we're trying to address rather than pointlessly worry  for instance  about 400 years of European colonialism). Today  I'd classify myself as a moderate  although many on the left would probably categorize some of my views as being right-wing. As one gets older  I think it becomes easier to put some of these sterile ideological battles into proper perspective.   BTW  sorry for the typo in my initial comment  which should read Dalhousie/Khan.,?

1292,Oh for sure  the point of tipping is to encourage/reward better service.  I'm not against tipping as a system.  I'm just referring to how the new law is significantly jacking up the minimum wage  and thus costs to business and prices to consumers.  If our prices are going to jump because those employees are getting paid 70% more in hourly wage  the case justifying big tips goes down.  The new law applies to tip-jobs too.  The tip-job minimum wage is going from $5.29 last year to $8.98 by 2020.   The tip-job minimum is fixed at $3.02 less than the regular min wage  which is being ratcheted up to $12 by 2020.  https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdle/minimumwage,?

1297,And there are 6 million US jobs that are directly dependent on trade with Mexico (one million in Texas alone) and 9 million that are directly dependent on trade with Canada.  And that doesn't count any number of support jobs ranging from the audit and tax firms that prepare shipping companies' financials to the restaurants just outside those shipping yards where all the workers eat.  Of course Trump's base knows nothing of this and most don't care (because they think that it's someone else that will get shafted  not them),?
1298,I speak for the Canada that is tired of bending over backwards for one malcontent province constantly seeking a handout.  So if I don't speak for you  you are obviously part of the parasites sucking on the government teat.,?
1299,Note he is a out of work collage professor.,?
1300,Stupid facts.  They don't matter.  It's all Trumps fault.  Let's protest  and tell anyone with a differing opinion that they're dumb racist bigots.,?
1301,This is way off the mark. You can make artificial moves to help a market do better but jobs and personal spending are the real thing that simulates real growth and a healthy market. The usual politician comes up with the same answer but some are more personable than others. Trump has a poor personality but has given real hope to Americans.  Just the threat of tariffs toward companies that were leaving the country added many jobs  as now they are sticking around.He shows business potential so the already frothy stock market has been given a new lease. Like him or not he is a different politician that is providing tangible results.,?
1302,No historian has ever made such a prediction. Well  no historian with an actual education in the discipline and who does their research beyond the internet.,?
1303,Charlie  you are failing to grasp the simple fact the average American does not work these jobs because they do not have the intelligence to learn these jobs anymore than they are capable of learning algebra. No one said there are no jobs that require algebra. You should try reading slower  and taking a long time to think it out  before posting stupidity online failing to grasp the issue.,?
1304,Uncle Sam sells crap.,?
1305,Trump is a white supremacist and a neo-nazi sympathizer. Yet that hasn't stopped Netanyahu from getting into bed with him. Israel has come full circle. From its citizens trying to escape Nazi tyranny to finally Israelis embracing fascism. The six million jews murdered by the Nazis must be spinning in their graves right now. There is no more anti-semitism. There is only ant-fascism. Israelis are now fascist sympathizers.,?
1306,I just don't get it.  Are there Republican policy wonks who sit around a table conjuring up actions to take solely intended to mess with people's lives in a negative way?  "Let's all see whom and how we can hurt the most today!"  The twisted alphabet soup of agencies and programs that are being cut/eliminated/reduced have real impact on actual people.  Is there a list somewhere of those next on the Gov's chopping block?  What is the Fed going to DO with this land they are so cavalierly repossessing -- from those who have a long history of being oppressed and lied to by the same Fed?  Are there undeveloped resources out in that desert that are crying out to be exploited?  What is the freaking purpose of all this rape and pillage being methodically undertaken by the Trump administration?  I think I need some right-wing mansplaining  and darn quickly  because this (et al) just seems shockingly stupid.,?
1307,Darn.  I would have been completely convinced had you used just one more exclamation mark.  Or maybe more caps.,?
1308,TJLYOM: Obama care didn't cause the rise in heath care premiums.

1309,The religious nutjobs and greedy pigs in the party want to increase immigration  keep pushing it all in the face of how destructive it has become to our quality of life. Insanity.

Not a recipe for social cohesion at all.,?

1313,Is dumb-tweet okay?,?
1314,So now  the racists and Nazi groups are praising Trump for not directly condemning or renouncing them.  Of course.  Nazis and racists are Trump's base  along with bigots and imbeciles  so why would he condemn them?  They are the people at his idiotic rallies.  Worst President Ever.  No one even comes close.  History will be correctly brutal and cruel to Trump.  He's a pathetic failure  along with the rest of his administration.,?

1322,In order to correct the typo that occurred while I was multi-tasking; Obama's memoir is entitled 'OBAMA: From Promise to Power' by David Mendell. If you don't have this book  I recommend reserving it from a library because it's educational.,?
1323,These are the people who should receive the Order of Canada  not the Garth Drabinsky's or Conrad Black's of the world.  The Order of Canada is nothing but garbage  recognising little beyond celebrity..,?
1324,I think the main problem is that you have the sequence reversed for the most part.  Wealth and capital is first accumulated through capitalism  and only then are the economic conditions created where children no longer have to work  governments can pay for schools  and perhaps even health care.  You can make a law outlawing child labor all you want (every country has one)  but unless you have the economic conditions to support it  it is totally meaningless.  Economics dictates reality  not government declarations.  If the choice is between children working or starving  they will work regardless of what the law says.  Under your definition of "socialism " practically every country on the planet qualifies as "socialist."  And yet  non-coincidentally  you chose to identify the wealthy Western capitalist countries as your examples of the success of "socialism."   Curious.    Strange how "socialism" tends to work best in wealthy capitalist countries eh?,?
1325," ... Any future agreements with Quebec will have to provide a reduction in Ontario electricity costs compared with other alternatives and demonstrate measurable reductions in greenhouse gas emissions  he wrote..."  This is perversely hilarious !!! Should have been the original green energy policy - but - Ontario was promised to become a leader in green energy ( wind & solar ) and the sun and wind were of course "free". So in the meantime Ontario spent ( will spend ) I don't know how many $$ Billions extra ( $35B ++ ) on infrastructure and contracts that could easily have been avoided. And now - after all the insane contracts have been signed anything delivered by Quebec has to demonstrate a reduced cost and CO2 emissions. This latter thought might have been applied to the original Liberal green energy mandate.  I weep  .-) .-(,?
1326,Environment is important  but so is keeping energy costs down for Hawaii's poor who are already impacted by our regressive economic and tax climate. AES could have or still could upgrade their general plant and emissions scrubbing technology if HECO payed them a better rate per unit produced or invested in the outcomes. Instead  AES struggles to maintain their now dated plant and standards. Ultimately  HECO should acquire AES before or after the 2022 'decomissioning'  make it a 'turnover'  hire all the AES workers (not management) and upgrade the plant fuel feed  boilers  generators and scrubbers in phases. Biofuel is notoriously hard to efficiently burn and supplies on an island may be erratic. State of the art scrubbing tech could reduce the emissions considerably  to where the ratio of cost to environmental impact may be reasonable and acceptable. At least until 2030+ when solar farms and storage are all viable  affordable and in place.,?
1327,Very clear and very reasonable to me.,?

1329,I'd make this fantastic woman president tomorrow. Or Lindiwe Sisulu for that matter.  And when she says "They said they are going ahead with charging me  irrespective of the fact that they are illegitimate" all I would add is that yes  that's true they are a total bunch of useless b*stards.....,?
1330,This is a terrible article filled with some very silly assumptions.,?
1331,The day is young  Dave.  I have faith that Dean can raise his game in the 'stupid comments' department.  Oh...I see that he already did.,?
1332,I'm with you on this one. And family trusts are very expensive to maintain; everyone would get the best bang for there buck if they would learn a little about how to deal with money so you can just give them the cash. Rick  you could make the inheritance conditional on their learning some things about financial management. Stranger things have been done in wills. If it were me  I would tell my kids beforehand they get a minimum $ amount regardless  but in order to get their full inheritance  they have to pass a multiple exam that I wrote. And if they don't step up  the money will go to an appropriate charity. If do they step up  it'll the most $$ per hour they ever make. And they'll know what they need to be financially functional adults.,?
1333,And to all the whiners  your jealousy is marked by your ignorance of what makes this world run.  It's money  you idiots. Dawson can investigate according to the mandate of her commission but not judge on direction Trudeau gave to his ministers.    If anyone is surprised at the "elitism" that the Trudeaus appear to be a part of  again  you're all idiots  caught up is your myopic jealousy that the world has been unfair to you.   Here's a thought for y'all to chew on..  Harper changed election finance laws in hopes of starving the Liberal Party of Canada 'cause the Conservatives thought they had the business world in Canada bagged and ready to strip.  And along comes Trudeau  moneyed and used to working in these circles crashing the good ship Tory Titanic.   To finish  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau may be part of the "elites" (whatever that is..) but his ability to move in these circles will do well for Canada.  ..until of course he gets caught hiding in a closet during a national crisis.,?
1334,Nice try MSW  but the bogus concern over the hacking and the effort to get Trump to admit to the loaded claim that "the election was hacked by Russia" is just pure grade A democrat poliiticking  in action.  The plain truth is that the election itself wasn't hacked by Russia.  The results of the election weren't hacked by Russia  and Trump had nothing to do with whatever Russia may have been doing.     What MSW and other progressive agitpropers want is to box in the PE with admitting the wholly false biscuit that the election wasn't fair  that Trump is working with Russia to undermine the USA.  It's shameful for MSW to engage in such meretricious and dishonest grandstanding by suggesting that Trump is a traitor.    Dishonest  shameful  junk journistic trash.,?
1335,Agree.  I was surprised to discover that the pro-fluoride rapid response teams actually get a special mention in the wikipedia piece on trolls.  It's no secret  -  except  of course  to readers of local publications all over the English-speaking world  who assume these trolls are also local readers.  Their fluoride-pushing masters are proud of their troll minions  and happy to brag about their work.,?
1336,We welcome all from all corners of the world. However  Canada has its own traditions  culture and social norms. Canada should not be forced to twist itself into a pretzel to make every minority group happy.,?
1337,Boots you clown! Just like you were convinced Trump would NOT win the presidency? What happened to the certainty? You're very ignorant in that you put everything in a Republican or Dumbocrap perspective. How about a taxpaying human perspective? You ain't got one cuz you stick to the ignorant perspective. dumbarse!,?
1338,I don't own stock in the companies mentioned.  But my reasons do not having anything to do with the argument posed in the column.    While I have no doubt that new regulations  robo advisers  ETFs and other "low cost" investment products will impact the business in the short term  I have all the faith in the world that the industry will continue to find new creative ways of extracting fees from selling investment product.  The only thing that will provide real meaningful change is investor education resulting more people refusing to pay fees that aren't justified by the returns.,?
1339,It is yet another wake up call. I live in California  40 or so miles from the beach  but we all know the storm drains go to the ocean. After a big rain  the harbors get filled with floating plastic bags and styrofoam cups  which eventually sink and drift away.  But all this crap from 7 billion people  and especially those of us at the coasts  isn't just going to biodegrade away.  We just banned plastic bags here in California for grocery purchases. I voted against the State Proposition because I thought it was stupid  but now have changed my mind. We use way less bags; no surprise there.  It is a hassle to bring a bag to the store  but we get by  and sometimes I use no bag at all.  There are ways our civilization can change to solve or at least reduce these problems.,?
1340,Fears?!?!  hahahahaha  This is nothing more than select banks making big reports out there to try and swade their own currency programs....ie. what they think is going to happen  and thus allow them to make money if a bunch of traders agree.  Or more slyly they may put this out but.....do the opposite.   The whole currency trade is a rigged setup.  Trade FOREX at your own peril.,?
1341,Maybe do some research before you label someone an MRA. As a listener of the Red Bar Radio Show  the only consistent value the host and the listeners have is that we are proponents of free speech. Sadly the current situation is that if you don't acquiesce to every aspect of the new progressive status quo someone can get your content banned from every outlet. You are doing a disservice to free speech by submitting lies about people as factual  and giving other Amy Millers the go ahead to ruin things that people worked very hard to achieve.,?
1342,There's nothing better to help out a major humanitarian crisis in our country than 18 holes of golf  for the second weekend in a row. Trump is a useless  disgusting man and it's sickening that he's in charge of our country. Nice job trump voters.,?
1343,We the people should take a close look at who are the main contributors to our members of Congress election campaigns and ask if those contributors have financial ties to the ultimate recipients of Affordable Care Act funds as well as funds from  other financial assistance programs and ask who really benefits from such programs. We the people should be looking for politicians who are interested in providing us with more economic opportunities to become the primary providers of our housing  food  health care  and retirement needs and seeing that these are affordable because of market forces thus possibly limiting federal funds to providing us with protection from enemies with weapons of mass destruction and recovering from or surviving major disasters and catastrophic illnesses thus avoiding the need for debating increasing the debt ceiling while finding funding to recover from major disasters like Harvey. The more we can do for ourselves the less government has to do for us.,?
1344,A couple of points of correction. 1. The referendum resulted in a vote supporting Brexit. 2. The Prime Minister has to get the support of Parliament to notify the EU to start the two year process to negotiate terms of exit. This is expected in February. 3. Scotland and Northern Ireland did not vote for Brexit  They are discussing options to stay in the EU. In short  nothing has happened to change their relationship with the EU ,?
1345,From the article: "Home Capital’s troubles are serious enough that there is the chance that it could go out of business. That means anyone buying the shares these days should be willing to accept the risk of losing a great deal  or even all  of their capital invested in the stock."  I disagree that going out of business = shareholders will be huge losers.    What about other articles I read that says that Home Capital's book value puts the share price at around $25?  Going out of business will mean a wind up and there might well be equity to distribute to shareholders.,?
1346,It's called the "Dunning-Kruger Effect"  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect  Basically  if you're really stupid  you lack the ability to comprehend that you're stupid. Conversely  if you're really smart  you can't comprehend just how stupid some people can be.,?
1347,we know two things about our elected representative now: 1 - he reads the paper to understand what his constituents are thinking rather than listening to us in the first person; 2 - he would rather speak to us via a newspaper than in person or via one of his newsletters or public events (any public event).  these are the practices of a cowardly representative who would rather seclude himself in the comfort of the "swamp" that is supposed to be "drained" than stand in the light of honest patriotic duty which our country  our congress  and that president  so desperately need,?

1359,I was surprised when liberals and the Media were all in favor. This seems to be a classic case of the old shoot first and ask questions later attitude this country seems to have. Have you read that our military is now killing civilians at a higher rate than the Russian? Maybe our bombs are more humane. Maybe if Assad had allowed that pipeline to be built through Syria  he would have been one of our best allies in the ME and Europe wouldn't have to rely on Russia for most of their gas. Just maybe.,?
1360,Mr. Fitchman:  I find your denigration of President Obama as "a monkey with a drum as president" disgusting and abhorrent.   You should be ashamed to stoop so low.,?
1361,Yes  I know Thomas Condon's story well.   I am an amateur paleobotanist and have studied his work closely and have spent a lot of time at several sites in the area that he first described. Yes  he lived here for many years and the mark he made on the University and the area in general is undeniable.  But he's still not from Eugene.,?

1365,"and admires the rows of lettuce  strawberries and other wilt-prone produce."  How about a commitment from Walmart Canada to source where possible  local sustainable produce and food.  Instead of peas  garlic  greens  and even salmon from China.  And of course an entire array of frozen fruit or veg or canned peaches and pears from China. Fish and seafood from Vietnam.   How about a commitment not to use food processors in China  as US Walmarts already do for salmon  chicken  and crab. Yup  US food products sent to China for cheap processing  and sent back to North America. How environmental and eco-friendly is that.  Actually forget it.  I have no plans of grocery shopping in Walmart anyways. no matter how many "Fresh" signs you hang on that cooler.,?
1366,Provided that this a real letter and not a fake Globe story  I am with you - how many times have we heard "after I had YOUR children I gained weight". Oh no cupcake not this time.

1380,Let me just say that I consider Mr Trump to be the same as Obama.....both are complete charlatans.,?
1381,Ric kinCalgary  like any crime  we need to identify the motive of the perpetrator.   Stephen Colbert is a legitimate and valuable satirist  and his target (that is  Trump  not Putin) was thoroughly deserving of ridicule  as any court will attest to. There was no intent to injure here  even though in retrospect  many people likely have been injured.   Some of Mr. Doyle's argument does not seem right  however. For starters  he needs to distinguish more clearly the legitimately Outraged from the pseudo-Outraged (the right wing). Those people can't possibly be really victims  because they are the most empowered in society.,?

1386,That's directly from Obama.  In fact he uses quite frequently  especially when he needs a boost.  Do you have a problem with it? I thought it folksy....,?
1387,I just watched what was on your link and wonder how a senator  Al Franken  can ask a candidate for speculation on something that he himself says was not verified. I also believe he did "st st stammering or twwiit ch ching  or sha shaking". Perhaps that's your point and you're offering irony  or parody? I even wonder  in legal sense  is it possible to lie about speculation? Perhaps that's why Sessions smiled at Franken's speculative question? Let's hope Franken learns to ask questions with foundation next time  and let's hope he works on his presentation skills for a better performance  one worthy of the position he holds. The position of AG is very important  and deserves better challenge than Franken offered. There are better choices in Congress for that type of questioning.,?
1388,Obstruction  collusion  stupidity........are we having fun yet folks?,?
1389,What I don't understand  (and I know that trump can't read)  is why he so opposed to a voluntary program to cut deadly gas emissions from the air.  If trumpie feels that the 28% proposed by Obama is too aggressive  then why doesn't he adjust it????  It is a VOLUNTARY pact.  If he wishes to lower our contribution to it  then  just do it!!  To completely walk away from it is just showing off!!  Climate change is far too real to be a BS rhetoric line.  Has the orange Dumbo even considered the price of staying out of the agreement as opposed to at least trying to enforce some the changes proposed by the agreement.  Renewable energy is the ONLY way this world can survive long term.  Like it or not  our resources (coal  etc) are FINITE AND DANGEROUS!!!  Coal is NOT coming back  sorry West Virginia.  It is over and YOU SHOULD  be glad.  Coal mining has done very little good in the last 100 years for this country except destroy the environment and exploit the coal workers!!  Good Riddance!!!,?

1391,WHAT A  WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Doesn't this country have better things to pursue instead of chasing after our POTUS?????  It really is RIDICULOUS that this country is embroiled in dirty politics.  We are so gullible and easily detracted from what is important to the people  safety and prosperity of this country.   Sadly  all the LEFT and LIBS seem to be enjoying their no class efforts to delegitimize this presidency  name calling everyone that does not see eye-to-eye with them.  So what names do you call yourselves??????   BIGOTS  HYPOCRITES  LIARS  what do you call yourselves?  Let me hear the echo of the heroic names you will attach to your lowly selves!!!  You're all a bunch of fools and stupid to let yourselves get caught up in this evil  nasty adventure of yours.  I am sad to say that if each of you were to reverse what you have been calling other people and call yourselves those names  would you be glad to be called those names????  I don't think so!!!!

Government should stop outlawing a natural substance.  I hope you have success.  We don't need to keep funding the worlds largest prison industrial complex.  What a waste.  No wonder we are slipping.,?
1400,This clown is not a leader. He's been in political office for 30 years and has done nothing. We should've voted for Duke Aiona last time but this state only votes for donkeys.   keep doing the same thing and expect different results is the definition of insanity.,?

1404,Why do we  Canadians  absolutely lose our minds about what is happening in the US?  Is it like rubber-necking a car accident where we just can't look away?  Or is it a not-so-subtle schadenfreude and gloating over the misfortunes of our neighbour?  Okay  we get it.  Trump is an idiot  albeit the democratically-elected idiot.  (Our own democratically-elected idiot is profiting handsomely by the contrast effect.  Compared to a 10-watt bulb  even a 30-watt bulb looks bright).    Thankfully  the American system of governance has checks and balances to keep idiots like Trump under control.  Just about everything he has tried to do has been quashed by these checks and balances.  Apart from endless media outrage  the legacy of the Trump administration will most likely be that nothing got done  period.   And  compared to what he wanted to do  that's probably a good thing.  If only we had the same!  Take a breath  people.  He's not worth losing our minds or having a stroke over.,?

On Sept. 13  the EEOC issued a notice of failure of conciliation against the law firm.",?

1415,I was pointing out how stupid his comment was. He was not harassed. He did not make any sense.,?
1416,No  Sanders isn't  (and I like me some Sanders)  by statistics anyway. Sanders isn't double covered  because Thomas always is  pretty easy to look good then.  I think DT is only second to Julio Jones since he's been in the NFL stat wise  but DT has a ring. I have the sneaking suspicion that if JJ was in Denver  people would find something about him they don't like  that's the way it goes.,?
1417,The gang of six wrote it  the three democrat caved in to the three republicans to get them to vote for it. Democrat wanted a single payer plan and the republicans fought that idea. Then came the Obama is a one term President and all cooperation for the good of the  American people came to an end. As far as medicaid support  congress never approved it  went to court to fight it.,?
1418,As Americans have learned to say  he is your PM and he can do what ever he wants.,?

1421,This whole topic is stupid. We're talking about briefly relieving ourselves. It should be according to be by your physical sex. Leave the bathroom and carry on.,?
1422,Regarding your numbers  Dennis:  based on the priests that I have known in my lifetime  I would say that the vast majority of those who were unmarried were gay -- 80% (and I am being generous on the side of not overstating)  at the very least.  (And for those who are inclined to quarrel with me about married priests  please remember that in my Church (rite)  that's permitted.)  I think that is what makes this entire issue so ridiculous to me -- most of those who are insisting that gay men may not become priests are themselves gay.,?
1423,You missed the 12.6 million deaths a year that the World Health Organization estimates are caused by environmental issues.,?
1424,Senator Beyak might know about the school she grew up near  but there were many more schools existing for more than a century. The narrow sample from which Beyak is drawing her anecdotal knowledge simply can't be applied across the board. I also highly doubt anyone ever told her they "owe their lives" to the schools. No one's asking her to get information from the media  god forbid. I'd like her to read the scholarship that has resulted from many many hours of diligent digging in church and government records. You know  facts  not anecdotes  not opinions.,?
1425,Excellent story about a part of reality that few people ever see or care to know about. Bzeek and his wife are exceptional people  caring for exceptional children. One can only imagine the sights  the smells  and the  long sleepless night filled with cries and screams. One wonders  marvels actually  at the compassion and selflessness  dedication that so rarely is found among human kind.,?
1426,just  let  the  citizens  of  the  city   go  out  and  start  shooting  them   the  gang  members   nothing  lost.  just  illegals.  big  deal.  how  many  innocent  people  are  going  die  from  drive  by  shootings   enough  is  enough   this  is  our  country   not  their;s     those  of you  who  don't  like  what  I  have  to   say  go  live  with  the  muslims.  not  only  is  our  government  corrupt   city   country   state  and  federal.  our  cops   most  of them  are  corrupt  and  chicken  shit  to  do  anything  about  it.  how  many  illegals  and  muslims  rape  our  women   and  in  other  countries  .these  mayors  and  cops  they  hold  these  meetings   they  talk  a lot   of  bull  shit   and  that's  about  it. talk  talk.  nothing  ever  happens.  chicken   shit  fuckers.    if  a  member  of  my  family  was  killed  by  an  illegal  gang  member    i  would  clean  up  the  cities  all  by  my  self.   take  time  but  I'll  do  it.  enough  is  enough.,?
1427,Targeting only generic companies is stupid and this seems like a backroom drug deal between the Maryland democrats and big name drug companies.,?
1428,It would be nice to see everyone have some skin in the game  and that means taking some of the PFD to spend on our government. Less than 40% of Alaskans have jobs to tax  and once you "progressivise" the code to exempt the working poor  then even fewer will have to pay a whopping state income tax to continue the PFD entitlement welfare check. If the annual PFD is the only thing keeping your finances afloat  perhaps a change of locale should be considered to a lower cost state.,?

1431,F the police. As long as the anti-factual  anti-reality  idiotic  immoral  worse-than-merely-worthless  un-American S*x Offender Registries (SORs ) exist  I will never support law enforcement or ANYTHING that they ever try to accomplish.  I pray these hurricanes wipe these places out and kill every single person who supports the SORs. Don't help hurricane victims because you might be helping scumbags who support this.  The SORs are an act of war. Bring it on.,?

1434,Even if road tolls were approved there would continue to be a deficit to fund transit upgrades. In the words of Rob Ford TO doesn't have a revenue problem; it has a spending problem. The tax base can't support the tens of thousands of public sector workers with their generous salaries and perks. The fat needs to be trimmed big time because there are FAR too many of them to begin with. Instead of always taking the easy way out by sticking it to the taxpayers time and again the city needs to change its culture of reckless and profligate spending. They need to learn to spend within their means like responsible people do instead of treating the tax coffers like a bottomless ATM. Problem is  no one is minding the store. There's no accountability so the piggies are getting a free pass to gorge at the tax trough at will.,?

1440,Joel the State law is clear  you have the right to pack on UA campuses. The Federal law is less clear  and you don't always have the right to pack on college campuses. This hoopla is all about a policy  which is not a law  same with the ban on guns in the State Capitol. The law is clear  you have to right to pack while visiting the State Capitol. The policy is clear also  you are not encouraged to pack while visiting the State Capitol. The UA policy is the same. What is the issue?  Aside: When I pack I bring smoked salmon and sesame seed bagels. We all prioritize differently when we are packing.,?

1462,The term 'iconic' is vastly over used yet I can understand it having been applied to TH particularly so in less harried areas outside downtowns where people would linger and develop the place into some minor local meeting place.  All that is bound to change with the steady deterioration in the quality of the baked wares  the lessening of choice in them as they add all sorts of other stuff including soups that smell up the joint. The large scale employment of TFWs certainly doesn't add to the 'Canadian' angle which has now been totally destroyed by the foreign takeover.   Time will tell  but I suspect that alternatives will in time take market share from the Brazilian TH.,?

1466,He is a drug dealer and his product is ending up in the hands of children.  He and every other drug pusher/cultivator are not nice people. They are money hungry scum that doe not deserve to be in polite society.,?
1467,You mean all Canadians who don't have to work. Yeah that's a real alternative for the masses. You're being silly.,?
1468,No   we won't run out of food if they pave PHA. The general response is emotional   rather than practical. We already bring in most of our vegetables. The additional cost would be less than 50c per kg. We will run out of food if farmers keep getting murdered or if their land is invaded.,?
1469,Surround yourself with military generals. Old script  new player. See: "totalitarianism.",?
1470,What a stupid post  contempt of court for the Head of State and Commander in Chief. Nice diatribe  wrong planet. President Trump should continue to pissoff the lefties  continue with a multitude of executive orders and do us all a favor - send up a seal team to deal with you so we don't have to read your posts anymore.,?
1471,Gorsuch is a thief  and should be shunned as such.,?
1472,Then why did the Declarations of Secession of Georgia  Mississippi  South Carolina and Texas all declare that the white race was superior to the black race and the black race being enslaved was the only way they could exist in America?  "Our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite ideas; its foundations are laid  its cornerstone rests  upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery  subordination to the superior race  is his natural and normal condition. " - Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens  March 21  1861   I realize you're a Trump supporter so you probably don't appreciate things like "facts " but you could stand to crack a book sometime before you go online and make an ass out of yourself with your ignorance.,?
1473,Indeed. Alaska is overwhelmingly conservative  and I personally cancelled my delivery subscription years ago when it was the Daily News - Elise Patkotak in particular along with the overall constant liberal slant forced me to stop supporting such journalism.  I had high hopes when the buyout happened a couple of years ago  but unfortunately nothing positive happened and overall the paper went further left.  Know your market. Correct things by stopping the continual rabid leftist slant and everyday working Alaskans like myself will again be happy to subscribe.,?
1474,Are all your heroes cowardly psychos?,?
1475,I understand. You a parasite yourself. Did I hire you at one time to kill brown people so that I could get some cheap gasoline? I signed up in 1972 to supposedly kill yellow people  and we didn't even get cheap gas out of it. Still getting that goverment check?,?
1476,I'm sure the NATO countries  who Trump says he won't defend  feel differently.,?
1477,If sexual harassment means being harassed because of your sex then the biggest victims would be men because they are constantly told by the media how inadequate  evil  clumsy  unaware  intolerant  stupid  etc. etc. etc. they are.  And if they try to speak up for their concerns  e.g. in MRA's  they are labeled racist  sexist  haters  and every other despicable name under the sun.  *That's* sexual harassment.,?
1478,Import levies are paid buy the buyer  so Trump would be taxing Americans - LoL!,?
1479,Your invited but your friend can't come,?
1480,I would leave Bush 43 and Obama off any list until 10 years have passed since they left office. It helps to remove emotions from entering in  and goes more toward policy positions as being good or bad for the country in the longer run.,?
1481,I believe I have a better view of what Steven Shea's comment was about.  Rush Limbaugh is a hypocritical  mendacious  mercenary blowhard  just like Trump.  That you would quote the one to justify the other is a sad comment on yourself.,?
1482,Whatever value comes out of the ground is an increase in our economy. BUT we still have a billion dollar gap to fill. So this is not a total solution.,?
1483,aa another hate filled left winger again! save the stupid nonsense sheep  trump is not causing anything  our weak leadership is.,?
1484,I hate when white trash come floating over from the 48. On the "48" they call it drifters.,?
1485,This is my best friend you're talking about  who always yells at me for driving too fast. He was intoxicated and walking at night  in dark clothes in the lane. Her life is now completely traumatized by this accident that she will have to live with forever. So  Show some fucking human decency  instead of parading your idiotic logic on the internet you twat.,?
1486,And there will be more blows. Some Indian Bands are going about this the wrong way. Using terms like cultural genocide and settlers will only cause further strife and potential violence.,?
1487,A lasting legacy from Christy Clark and the BC Liberals who chose NOT to fund the remediation the dangerous fuel left on the forest floor from the pine beetle infestation  but instead chose to hide the surplus funds in a slush fund dedicated to election victory.  Last year  she refused to prevent the problem because the province was broke and destitute and the corporate tax rate needed to be kept 2% below the national average.  The year before that  Christy chose not to remediate the excess fuel because she had spent the wild fire budget on her LNG Prosperity Fund.  The BC Liberals have consistently underfunded wild fire prevention funding  and the people of BC have consistently suffered  as they do today.  It's good for the people of BC that the Liberals are lost and gone.,?
1488,Hang the drug dealers !!,?
1489,our mayor is an idiot. this runaway project will doom this state.,?
1490,"Exactly my point."  It must be foggy in Ewa Beach today  what is exactly your point?  "Surely the mere fact one is in Hawaii does not make it a vacation?"  Only if one visits Hawaii on an expense account and the net result of the visit is a tan and a hangover. If you object to vacation  perhaps junket it more to your liking.,?
1491,Ed  Thank you for your honesty.  With politicians unwilling to negatively affect their political careers  this dismal fiscal situation will not be solved anytime soon.    Personally  I've seen enough and have left the state for the greener pastures of my childhood home  the State of Wisconsin.  Reasonable and somewhat conservative state management these last years have affected a economic turnaround surrounding Wisconsin's state budget  to include the private business climate.  As you likely know  Foxconn is building a multi-billion dollar plant south of Milwaukee; it will be a statewide boon.  Perhaps I'll return to Alaska upon retirement in 15 years if the state broadens its economic base  reduces its expenditures and governmental waste.  I have my doubts.  Meanwhile  my large 4-bed  3-bath home is for sale in Palmer... the market is tight and sale prices remain good.  I'm hoping to sell soon...  Alaska has been fun for 23 years.  Perhaps I'll return when sanity does.,?
1492,No kidding. All those oil company haters are gonna see the hurt put on Alaska's economy for the next few years while we are in a serious downturn. We just lost 30% more in the Anchorage office to layoffs last week. But you know these same people don't know enough about commodities or global business to understand  they will continue to blame the oil companies. Like a bunch of damn parrots,?
1493,He said  "Take to send him back to his country of origin..." How is that not a racist statement? Its just a coded way of saying  "Send him back to Africa." I am not saying that the guy is innocent or defending him in any way  however to say send him back to his country of origin when the man is very clearing from the United States of America is racist and if you don't see that then you are extremely ignorant.,?
1494,"Leitch and Bernier are clueless."  pretty well sums up today's Tories  and these two want to be the leader.  As for the CBC  a public broadcaster is needed to counter the opposite culture of the private sector media.,?
1495,same dog and pony show welcome to brain dead  self serving  arrogant  politics,?
1496,Wow. Sending him back to jail and only adding $10 000 to his bail after catching him trying to flee. Criminals aren't the only stupid people here!,?
1497,Yeah  they could have shot that stick wielding criminal.  That would have taught him a lesson.,?
1498,"24 million to lose coverage by 2026 under Trump-backed health bill: Congress' analysis " Wow! That's an interesting way for President Alternative Facts and his Merry Gang to Make America Great Again......,?
1499,My stand is quite clear...I support NEITHER candidate....and I've said CLEARLY that BOTH Clinton AND Trump supporters are equally blind.   If you Clinton cheerleaders are too blind  stupid and arrogant to fail to see that in your own little "well if they don't support Trump then they just have to support CLinton" world....it ain't my problem.,?
1500,canada run by lunatics! there are only 2 genders  male or female   at any given moment you are iether one of the other  regardless of what you identify as   this is about the stupidest policy we can do to canada,?

That's nature people how can we possibly control a 12 000 pound orca seriously he should be freed to be with his family period.He is no killer.,?
1503,Liberals are so triggered/butthurt that they lost. Pathetic. Grow the fück up.,?

1507,filthy corrupt swamp,?
1508,Agreed  the author (Doug Saunders) believes high population would be good for Canada. I don't see it either. We have a hard enough time keeping up with the growth we have. I just got back from Barcelona  they have a population far less that Toronto (40% less) but a subway system 2x as long and number of stations. Chicago is the same size as Toronto and has 2x our size system and supports more interesting architecture and arts.   We have a sufficiently high enough population to achieve the scale needed to support many projects. We just need political leaders with the will to take them on.,?
1509,Stupid is what stupid does  let em all drown out there.  Ban emergency services to the floatilla instead.  Play at your own risk.,?
1510,Let me confirm ... I am indeed prejudiced against " Ignorant  self-righteous fanatics who feel they have every right to mess with other folks lives."  They're free to practice their mumbo-jumbo among themselves  but they best keep from messing in other folks lives.  -- Paul,?
1511,No  actually one can protest very quietly. Boycott American products if there are alternatives  don't travel to the USA.  By the way he carries on it is quite possible that he'll blow a major gasket  sooner than later. Things will then go back to what passes as normal in the USA. ;)  :),?
1512,When I was living in Anchorage and active in municipal politics during the 1990s  it was understood by those affected that the transportation inspector's office was supposed to operate on a self-support basis. One year  this was called into question when it became known that the TI office racked up over $60 000 in interagency charges to the municipal attorney's office to enforce the collection of less than $5 000 in fines. Unless there was revenue involved  they were expecting the taxi companies to police themselves. Then they started targeting people who were bringing these issues to public attention. The TI at the time  Col. Llewellyn  was telling people that he had a background in military intelligence (which was false) and this is why Mystrom hired him  to spy on the taxi business and clean it up or some such nonsense. Then he wanted to extend this same sort of regulation to ice cream trucks. With that track record  perhaps some of us fail to see any regulation as a good thing.,?
1513,What does Trump being the president *now* have to do with anything?  So misogyny gets a pass when men like Clinton and Kennedy leave office?   This is minor stuff that Trump is muttering.  It's no different than various other stupid mutterings politicians make on a daily/hourly basis.  Hardly the same thing as the sexual slavery Atwood wrote about.  Really  this Trump Fever is becoming pathological.,?
1514,1982--35 years ago. Close. A lot has changed since then. I fly at least 2x per month  and no one would get past the gate without a preassigned seat. Personally  I have no problem with AC. But then I know how to navigate the systems  choose my seats in advance and get to the airport on time.,?
1515,The leftist media has been unhinged for months now. It is totally hypocritical of them to assume to know that Trump might have mental issues.   You can't be delusional  lying  and insulting and then be so outraged when your victim finally fires back. People are watching and paying attention and don't buy this stupid  blatant bias.,?
1516,marion sproul ... research has shown that when you believe fake news you are more likely to blurt out stupid comments,?
1517,It's just like having the grseatest military on earth  and not using it. Stupid idea.,?
1518,cherokeehombre is a Russian troll  Super obvious dude,?
1519,Patrick Caddell  oh and Michael Moore nailed as well as anybody.,?
1520,What the **** is "extreme pornography"???,?
1521,The presidency  the House  the Senate  and a majority of States are all Republican controlled. They are about to tear Obama's legacy of non-bipartisan edicts to shreds. The Hardrock Mining Reform and Reclamation Act  along with getting legislation passed in Alaska for "Benefit Corporations" are about the best triage we have available to us at the moment.,?
1522,I really don't care if it becomes 'legal' or not as long as I have access to what I need to end my OWN life if needed and NOT have my family prosecuted for not stopping me. Pain and suffering is NOT something most of us enjoy  we should have a choice..,?
1523,You know the opposite of something stupid is something equally stupid and you're demonstrating that right now.,?
1524,This man is sickening... and makes our country look like a joke to the rest of the world. But he's a reflection of the Republican Party (not all... I know quite a few Republicans who are sickened by him too) and a boorish bully culture that rejects science  facts  education and actual news.,?
1525,The countries remaining in the pact have said it's non-negotiable. Hopefully  they'll maintain that stand against the semi- ignorant  mentally deficient demagogue who thinks he has the power to negotiate anything he doesn't like. Trump has become tiresome with his lies  alternative facts and vapid comments.,?
1526,And again  the relevant calculus is not did you get 100% of what you wanted all the time.  The relevant calculus was whether an Obama presidency was preferable to a McCain presidency (you think Obama bombed a lot?)  or a Romney presidency (the very definition of a corporate bandit).  Voting your "conscious" with a third party isn't going to get you anything different  and it might get you something worse.  If you think casting a vote entitles you everything you in particular want relative to the millions of other people who also cast their votes  I guess that might go a long ways in explaining your problems...,?
1527,WAAAH screams the butthurt commie loser! WAAAH! Man  are you people thick.,?
1528,This has the hallmarks of Gerald Butts  a total clown for sure,?
1529,No question asked  just a statement.,?
1530,Fail to see the correlation here....dumb reply.   Try to stay on topic or do not relpy is even better,?
1531,Great news... looks like the feds might be very happy with the rail plan.,?
1532,And the democrats were so awesome and uncorrupt that they chose Hillary Clinton as their candidate....  Both parties suck  and pretending one is better than the other just makes you look like a blind partisan hack Gerald.,?
1533,If Junkyard Dog is right and the loss is due to retirees  (you know the people who didn't get any Social Security  COLA increase this year and minimal ones for several years before this)  perhaps they just couldn't afford this bond which provided nothing for them.,?
1534,Always interesting that no matter where one goes  whenever there is a shortage of money for the government body to operate on  the mom and apple pie services are the first to be cut.    "We've trimmed back on what was nice to have."  Apparently that does not include the 4 star gourmet chef in the senate lunchroom!  So reduce the Troopers so crime can increase  which means that honest people will suffer until they beg to give the State more money to operate.  Decrease the Ferry traffic which brings tourists to the State  who spend money here.    Why does the State give out construction money to anything but roads  schools  and those other projects not listed as a Constitutional requirement?  Private charities used to provide for a lot of services which have been "taken over" by the State and now the State wants more money or they will be cut?     "Is state government "too big" or "right-sized"?  The answer depends on whether you are a sucker or a producer!,?
1535,But of course Trump is a child like moron in an old mans clothes so yes  for like minded people I can see it looks as if he gets things right.  All the mistakes on this man were made in the US by US authorities and the Trumpet is lying about that to whip up hate and fear.  His ignorant base is easy to control when they hate and fear.,?
1536,Unless that impacts the delivery of the services somehow  I don't see the issue.  I don't need to see the face of the secretary who tells me to fill out a form.,?
1537,And  Mr. Trump won't even LET us have a "look" ... at HIS business records/taxes.  What IS he hiding???,?
1538,An elected official or appointed government official hold their titles for life. That said  it is optional to say President or Mr. or former President. Fox news is notorious for addressing Sarah Palin as governor and former speaker of the house new gingrich as Mr. Speaker.,?
1539,He has been conservative in his investments over the last few years for sure   yes! However he has pledged to change that and set the bar lower for a 'stable' economy. So  the ship will right itself with a company like this . One interesting point is with FIH.U ( Fairfax- INDIA) he has led the pack with his bullish outlook. the little brother of FFH   but he took a different tac. Performance has been stellar !,?
1540,just goes to show any asshole can become president.i think Trump should be taken to the Rose garden given a nice lunch at tax payers expense of course then hung from the biggest tree in the rose garden,?
1541,They should start issuing trespassing tickets to these bears and moose. They can pay their fines in salmon  huckleberries or blueberries!,?
1542,The cowardly attack in Quebec must be condemned in the strongest terms but it's clear certain activists are trying to use this tragedy to push a political agenda to limit discussion on "sensitive" topics such as immigration and religious accommodations.  Iqra Khalid’s M-103 is a threat to freedom of expression in this country  there are no sacred cows and no religion is beyond reproach. We have seen European artists and filmmakers murdered for cartoons and films and rather than defend freedom of expression  we are seeing a submission to the idea of a double standard when it comes to comedy and satire  as if Monty Python's The Meaning of Life is fair game but anyone who dares approach a certain religion with comedy risks professional failure and their own personal safety. Freedom of expression is either free or it isn't (that includes religious satire and cartoons)- just look at Turkey over the last 10 years.,?
1543,You are a moron.,?
1544,Funny  at least someone will grovel to that cartel sewer trash. Mexico government are rapists and murderers and cowards. I don't take meetings with them at face value  and neither does anyone with geopolitical awareness.,?
1545,Like when you posted as "Richard Common Sense" under the old commenting system?,?
1546,Sullivan is a fraud and a coward.,?
1547,Wow  such delusion when it has been so solidly proven she is a liar.,?
1548,I couldn't believe what I read from one of the Senate leaders..."this is a representative democracy"  how would you explain  the majority's conduct during the current session?,?
1549,The GOP works desperately to take away health care for 30 million people and when the people protest  have them arrested. If Gardner votes to repeal and replace  then he needs to have the courage of his own convictions and stand up and defend his position. Asking the police to end the discussion is just another chicken shit GOP solution to the problem they created.,?
1550,Governance 101. Unless you want to start a war to oust them  you have to talk to them and take the long view that you can influence them to change. Embargo's  ignoring them  are short sighted feel good red meat tokens for the home crowd tough guys. Changes nothing. That said. Cuba is now changing and moving away from hard core communism  like China but not as fast. But with the end of the US embargo  likely much more quickly. You want in on some of that capitalist action which will benefit all Cubans? Then get in and start talking to them. That's why.,?
1551,Pell grants ( autocorrect sucks),?
1552,Jason is exactly the type of new representative Alaska needs.    The voters of his South Anchorage district have a good and viable alternative to the failed leadership of the incumbent.   Now it's up to them to elect him and be part of positive change.,?
1553,Yes  they don't get enough attention already as a pro athlete.  Incisive analysis! /s,?
1554,THIS FUKR IS A CONFIRMED TERRORIST AND A MUSLIM ISIS SUPPORTING IMMIGRANT HE S NOT CANADIAN!,?
1555,The potato making us look like a bunch of idiots....again!,?
1556,Let Mrs. Speer and her children know what Canadians really support.  https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/help-raise-1-000-000-for-sgt-chris-speer-s-kids#/  send a message to Mrs. Speer and to the PM.  Yes  you will point out that Rebel Media is problematic and have other issues with this. But rather than saying what is not done in your name  do something in your name.,?
1557,Start with the anti-semite  Soros  you naive bytch.,?
1558,This week in Stupid.,?
1559,I thought it was an inept and ignorant way of saying that Trump frequently contradicts himself. If you check the dictionary  "peripatetic" can't be made to apply to either attention span or lack of consistency.  If I saw "peripatetic intellect" in isolation  I would think it meant broad or far-ranging intellect  something that clearly does not apply to Trump.,?
1560,Oh Forest!,?
1561,he sounds like a moron...and to solidify  that impression  he talks about toradol like it is cocaine...it's not  dude!..it is a step up from advil or motrin  not some 'orgasmic' illegal drug! once a douchebag  always a douchebag...,?
1562,why don't you bloody Brits  and for that matter all you aliens  keep out of our business.,?
1563,So Ann Coulter believed the rot Trump was spewing on the campaign trail? Haha! Sorry  lady  but you got played. How ignorant of you.,?
1564,Exchange going down down down in  your tum tum tum  Oh that Orangeape called the moron,?
1565,There are 5 levels of automous cars  6 if you include 0 which is no level of input.  It seems like most of the comments are directed at Level 5 which is completely independent  meaning no human input at all and that's a long way off.  Levels 2-4 are not that far off and will be safer and allow people to better utilize time normally spent driving doing something productive.  I greatly look forward to having a vehicle that  under normal driving conditions  only require my attention for the first and last 1/2 mile.,?
1566,Wish all you want but this will never get done in any of our lifetimes.,?
1567,Kill it!,?
1568,typical left wing delusion   capitalist are those who create every dam penny of taxes for us all idiot,?
1569,Very very true. No can order them from Amazon.com. Not even regular batteries. Funny if you order directly from Wasabi Battery company they will ship to Hawaii. Thank God for them to neutralize Washington stupidity.,?
1570,All the mockery and stupidity of TV entertainers will backfire on the left.  In case no one noticed the flyover country doesn't listen to the elites anymore ... the NYC and LA bubbles are not going to get democrats elected anytime soon.  The democrats  with their poor loser attempts to change the rules and mock  are seriously delusional.,?
1571,Mbalula is the biggest buffoon of them all. Not even the Guptas view him as a useful idiot. If anyone thinks Mbalula is not dirty somewhere somehow  they need their heads examined. Of course he's compromised  just wait for it,?
1572,You are a pompous blowhard. I want you to justify your article to the thousands of parents who lost their children fighting the Islamist terrorists  who are the Most evil vicious criminals the world has ever seen.,?
1573,Holy crap  Coach Christiansen was there when I played (badly) on the Palmer football team  and I'm 45! Wow! Way to go  Coach! Go Moose!,?
1574,Oh well. Play stupid games...,?
1575,It would be nice for Super Lisa to get a ban on offshore drilling in Alaska into this budget language  in return for ANWR access Drilling in the ocean  when there is safer drilling on land is one of the most asinine things I have ever witnessed in my life As far as tax revenue goes...taxes are not the "meaning of life" as pro Government forces would have us believe....there is a lot to be said for jobs and working for a living and we could use good paying jobs.... Although the taxes would be nice....we'll have to get Lisa to work on that too,?
1576,Well stated!   The "Donald" could be Vladimir Putin's dumb-azz uncle  for all we know. There is the whole banty rooster resemblance  the puffed up chest and the strut. God help us all!,?
1577,Citizens of countries with one electoral authority   compulsory voting and  only one method  paper or electronic  have no excuse for the idiots they elect.,?
1578,PS: the idea that government tax breaks are the reward for entrepreneurship is such an absurd joke it should never have seen print in the Globe. Entrepreneurs are captains of their destiny  and if successful can make far far more than any similarly positioned employee. THOSE are the rewards for their risk and hard work  not a sweetheart tax deal from Ottawa.  If taxes are going to make the difference to whether your business is successful  then it's not  and if you decided on a life of self-employment to get a tax shelter  then you're a fool.,?
1579,Dims always circle the wagons around their trash. Hillary is no different than Fornicator Bill.,?
1580,Imagine what Toronto's condo industry would be like if private sector construction developers were  as stupid  and criminally incompetent as the government is in building anything.,?
1581,Its factual  read the constitution...,?
1582,You're an idiot. I've been to PR a couple of times AND I voted for Trump. The great thing about both Texas and Florida is that people helped each other. FEMA and other government agencies did their job but a huge part of relief came from people helping out their neighbors. We haven't seen that in PR.,?
1583,That kind of "blame the victim" jihadist apologist drivel is the classic signature of a good little dhimmi that believes that everything will be OK as along as he pays his jizya tax...,?
1584,Unless you're paying out of pocket for your health care  then someone is also paying for your insurance subsidy and it's not just you. If you have insurance through your employer  why should they have to subsidize your insurance?,?
1585,Charge the moron.  FORMALLY charge the moron. We've spent years  and thousands  trying to offset the longstanding damage of bullies. Trying to reverse the trend. This twit implies that bullying builds character!? For what?! For a few days in the limelight again after his drug-riddled career is fading from centre stage. Enough. Alleged 'actors' are people who make millions standing where someone tells them to stand and saying what someone else again tells them to say. Your average parrot has more talent and more intelligence than most alleged 'actors'.  And this guy thinks he's a voice we should hear. Switch off Kimmel. Bury Perry in legal challenges and issues. Move on to common sense.,?
1586,Amurica  huck ya. Freedom  huck ya. Big Trucks  huck ya. Fake tits  huck ya. Assault rifles   (ummmmmmmm) ya maybe not so much really.  Time for a rewrite Uncle Sam.,?
1587,If those are valid components of the pact the I see your point.   I'm not sure you can understand all the trade offs an international treaty involves.    I know I can't know the background in detail.  Anybody can point to a negotiated settlement and complain that they don't like all components.   That's why it's negotiated  not a command from an oaf like Trump or any other leader.   The hope is in the concept that we are mutually effected by the climate health of the globe.   It's indisputable fact that the developed nations have a hugely disproportionate consumption of the globes natural resource and the impact of releasing carbon in processing.    With power comes responsibility and accountability.,?
1588,snopes is alt-left.  Try an unbiased source...    http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=alt-left,?

1590,Went right over your head  didn't it.,?
1591,This was a ranked ballot and unless all the votes involved were for Bernier the result would be the same. Scheer would still win.,?
1592,Calling Trump an idiot is much too charitable and kind.  Trump is pridefully and willfully ignorant about just about every subject a President needs to know about.  I really wish he was just an idiot.,?
1593,The Deal most probably involves the workers working twice as long for half the pay.  Under a Left Admin the Media would be up in arms. But today  all see Trump as savior.  When would the workers learn that whether Left or Right it is their destiny to be shafted. With high minimum wage of the Left  the jobs disappear. With low wages of the Right  the incomes disappear. A lose-lose.  The businessman always wins. Grin and bear it.,?
1594,Are we pushing to make automatic weapons legal again in Washington?  Or are you just ignorant of the law?  Be careful when you are trying to take away someone's Civil Rights.,?
1595,Sure  we all criticize people for taking positions we don't agree with.  Laraque did ... and explained his reasons.  All Schelter- said was that he's stupid.,?
1596,But  dammit  the man can virtue signal!,?
1597,You say that every time.... and then you hit your thumb with the hammer  every time. Pathetic....,?
1598,That's about the best description of Trump I've seen yet  a narcissist with an ego so big that he truly is not capable of keeping his mouth shut.,?
1599,My guess is Sally herself  is not above suspicion! The Justice Department doesn't just work for the corrupt Democrat Party  or for the Obama's to harass their enemies. Rot in HELL Ms Yates!,?
1600,ATVs are super safe. It takes some special skills to crash one.,?
1601,A day late and a dollar short.  And then to slam the CEO of Merck Pharmaceuticals for quitting his post on Trump's manufacturing council over Trump's initial response show just how much of racist bigot he is.   Deflect to Obama all you want. Trump is still a racist bigot and he is currently the POTUS not Obama.,?
1602,Better build a bomb shelter like they did in the 50's; the Russians are coming! The Russians are coming!  Oh I'm sorry  the Mexican's are coming too!  Build that wall! lol  aloha and have a wonderful Kamehameha Day,?
1603,Its called "exploration" for a reason people. Everybody relax.,?
1604,Yeah  only the best  brightest and most fit are qualified to take a bullet in stupid  useless wars that Obama said he'd get us out of...but never did  of course. But  you can keep your...oh  never mind  that one fell through  too. He has a Nobel prize  though! Glad we popped that zit!,?
1605,An idiot  they appear now and again here on this comment section.,?
1606,Stupid trival soundbite campaigning.  Why can;t we have a campaign on the actual issues  on the economic policies.  Heck the NDP promised to add 4 cents a litre tax to gas today - why is not that headlines????,?
1607,Yeah  and Bill Clinton only adores and respects for women. Hitlery's a pig for being with Bill. Her husband has used and abused more women than anyone  including Trump could ever have. THAT doesn't seem to bother the socialists though.,?
1608,Jackson! your press release astounds me !! there is great reference to some areas where things have started to happen and rightly so BUT the big thing that everybody is up in arms about is zuma and state capture ??? there is absolutely nothing mentioned about this ??? How come??? One can only assume that you and the ANC are now standing up to protect zuma?? And then you go on that government will collapse if he is voted out !! HUH since when is the running of the country dependent on one man and why do you have a duty president ?? your argument so full of rubbish and nonsense that it defies even the basic common sense test. PLEASE IGNORE COMPLETELY WHAT THIS CLOWN HAS JUST SAID!!,?
1609,The best approach is NOT to say "JT bad  JT very bad".   That was the whole point of the article...don't focus on the teflon man.  The best approach  IMHO  is to say something to the effect of: "Here is what they promised; here is what they actually did.  Do you really want more of this bait-and-switch?  Here's what we will do.  You may like it  or you may not  but at least you can trust us to follow through on our promises."  I wouldn't even mind:  "They fooled us once; shame on them.  If they fool us again  shame on us."  but such raw truth in advertising would probably hit a nerve.,?
1610,klastri>  I think  now I only think that George Soros has a hand in all of the protests  but again I may be wrong.  Is the ACLU and DEMs paying the ANTIfa????,?
1611,Really? Which part is BS? The part that makes the Trumpster out to be either a complete idiot  or totally compromised by the Russians?  Or is it fake news because you don't agree with it  because doing so would make you question your own intelligence for voting for the most incompetent president in modern history  and maybe ever?,?
1612,Sorry I don't have an hour to spend on this site,?
1613,who tells you this crap-- it is as bad as cigarettes physically and given it is a drug it can have serious (I have treated it) mental and emotional impacts-- short or long term.  Yes alcohol is bad! It has huge impacts  but so does weed!,?
1614,Grab him by the pussy,?
1615,It's fine that you're proud of being a bigot  a racist and a xenophobe  but no serious adult wants that in the Presidency representing our country.  There are simply not enough Klan member types to get trump elected.  In 6 weeks  he'll be ancient history - a bad memory  just like Palin...,?
1616,' Trouble is Trump installed them in the White House.  …or were you not paying attention? . . How to resist Trump  …something for everybody   …practical actions everyone can join in on.  Complete and comprehensive manual available here:  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DzOz3Y6D8g_MNXHNMJYAz1b41_cn535aU5UsN7Lj8X8/preview#,?
1617,That's because there is no such place.  You're just a dunce suburbanite!,?
1618,"The lady doth protest too much  methinks." It amazes me that people still reject these reports out of hand after Comey's firing and Trump's leakage.  The first reports were from "unnamed" officials and Trump came out afterwards proving them true.  I am astounded that the same people still reject these reports when it became obvious that Fox News was doing the exact thing they were criticizing "leftist  "liberal" "fake news" media of.  It seems they function upon a completely subjective standard that anything they don't see personally isn't real (or else still believe Fox News is reliable).,?
1619,They are too stupid to know their own rules and some of them are even more stupid for considering letting illegals vote. They should all be recalled.,?
1620,I can't imagine having a open and respectful conversation with someone who thinks like you. Broad brush insults and close mined opinions.  Boring and ignorant.,?
1621,As long as the Feds prevent monopolies (think Amazon  Facebook  AT&T  Google  Microsoft  ATT&T & Dell - the last three the Feds uses exclusively itself)  good. Maybe something like a limit on the number of states any single business can operate in? Consumers need to do more to look after themselves instead of letting the nanny state take care of them like toddles. Have you seen some of the warning labels on products? Look at the warning labels on curling irons sometime. Or hair dryers. We need tort reform as well to cut down on frivolous lawsuits by con-artists looking for a big payout.,?
1622,Bring on the bots! More leisure time for all! Guaranteed income for all!,?
1623,Stop spouting rubbish. Previous article mentioned the cost to retrofit at Marco Polo was around $4 500 per unit.   And learn to do math  building built in 1971 makes it only 46 years old. You're the problem with America.,?
1624,Who said he was innocent  cretin?,?
1625,there is no definition of trophy caribou in any f and g literature. fact. it is subjective  which was my original point. all these people screaming about trophy hunting are absolutely the most ignorant on the issue.,?
1626,Thanks you bum Obama.  Get out and let the real men try to clean up your messes.,?
1627,It's a good thing to be cohesive and work on the 'mind' of what you're supposed to be doing.    I hope  and expect  that the coaching staff also understands that an athlete needs rest and down time both mentally and physically.   That can be hard to find if you extend your season into late December and January.    I really don't understand football's physical stress (I never played)  but head injuries and blown out knees  are hard to miss.   I'm loving the emotion and energy of coach Taggert and assume he knows how to protect the long term health of our players.   It's a tough game  but an athlete has to live with consequences to their body for the rest of their life.  Again  I like and trust coach Taggert to do the right thing.,?
1628,Lil Wayne is worth $150M. Gubner Walker ought to show up at his dressing room with basket of Alaska's finest marijuana  kiss his ass  and sell him a couple shares in the gas line boondoggle.,?
1629,And just who thinks its a great idea to be overrun with illegal felons? Step up and name yourself so we know who among us is the most incredibly stupid.,?
1630,We can start by cutting the Legislator's COLA payments  staffing  and salaries.  No pay once the legislature exceeds 90 days.  No pay for special sessions.  If they can't live on their exorbitant salaries for 90 days then they deserve to be fired.  No Juneau leg should get COLA for living in their own home.,?
1631,Bravo  Lou.,?
1632,McMaster is either a fool  or he condones American Nazis and white supremacy kooks.  Either way  he is not ready to be truthful and he is not suitable to be anywhere near the White House.  Resign now in shame and that would help MAGA.,?
1633,Done but not dead. And that horror Chelsea is now gonna run for the Senate. KILL THEM ALL,?
1634,What a stupid question!  Well  actually the question is okay  the choices for answers are stupid!,?
1635,...all show and No Go for Kim! kinda like our Politicians "All Talk and No Action". He's laughing at  us by just watching the news. He loves the chaos he's created in the MSM. He's got the liberal left in a tissy. Haaaaaaaaa! "Oh No! Trump's  provoking Kim Jong Un he's going to use his nukes on us".  No! He's NOT! Watch  at the last minute you can bet  he'll pull back. I don't think for one minute Kim Jong Un is  that stupid. Why? This will ultimately mean the total annilhilation of  his Nuclear arsenal and the end of his regime.  He's just there to cause FEAR. That's is All !  Which reminds me of another dictator who  called the US' bluff. IMUA!,?
1636,They trying to look tough now  but when these two royal hawaiians get to Halawa their lives gonna change.  Drastically.,?
1637,Threatening bodily harm  now you are really making up lies and sound like a paranoid nut job. You also sound like maybe you are smoking that weed stuff you defamed me of using.  The only threat of bodily harm is coming from Kim and your beloved president Trump.  Wake up and get off whatever you are on . Candy okole guys like you live in their rat holes and poke their head out only when the lights are out and no one can see you.   Stay in your hole until you learn how to play nicely because we don't tolerate candy arse punks!,?
1638,Just draining the swamp of the scum....,?
1639,I started to correct you  it's CMD  but then I realized you're mentally handicapped and it's a miracle you learned how to type at all.,?
1640,perhaps tomorrow Jennifer will take a good look at the Democrat party and its leaders actions that already fit well with her statements of what might be..!!..they are already there using the IRS against certain Americans...the lawless US justice system they have currently in place choosing to  or not to subject certain Americans to the forces of the laws...,?
1641,Laugh yourself silly  Al.  Mueller has his own problems running an investigation on a President for colluding with the Russians while trying to cover his own butt. Why did he not make his knowledge of Russian interference in our Uranium Industry known to the Congress who opposed the deal. The Russians were bribing American executives in an attempt to corner the world Uranium industry.  He should have resigned in protest of the Obama approval of the deal.   Manafort was Trump’s campaign chief for a brief time but who wasn’t?   Manafort also was the point man who worked the Russian side of the Uranium deal with the two Podesta Brothers.  John Podesta was in charge of Hillary’s campaign.  The Obama Administration gagged Mueller’s confidential informant who set up these crooked deals.   Sessions just ungagged him.  Stay tuned for the real fun!       None of this was supposed to happen but Hillary lost and now the house of cards she built is collapsing on them all.   On you too  Al.,?
1642,Fallon is a liar in the Clinton tradition.,?
1643,Excellent Mike  those were tough times and only the tough survived. Great memories.,?
1644,The rest of the "full story" is:  "Another witness told police that Bolt said he started the fires and rode away on his bicycle along the bike path.  "On Monday afternoon  police with the Gang and Crime Suppression Unit found Bolt walking up to the driveway behind Lowe's from the St. Vrain Greenway. He had a maroon Specialized hybrid-style bicycle and he walked with a limp because he has a broken right ankle.  "Josh said that he was riding his bicycle last night when he noticed the smoke and stopped by Issac (sic) Walton Park and told the people there that he saw smoke and the police would be coming " an officer wrote in the report. "He told them this in case they had warrants and wanted to leave."  "Police arrested Bolt after a witness positively identified him in a photo lineup.  "In an unrelated arson case  police continue to search for a person who torched seven vehicles and one dumpster in early July."  They should check stolen bicycle reports  while they're at it.,?
1645,Just like Bruce Lee  Steven Seagal and Jackie Chan movies learned people how to fight...,?
1646,notice how phony lib trolls like shore try to lecture but never debate your points?? typical fascist liberals  they're way or nothing,?
1647,compared to left wing  the right are geniuses    the left are brain washed sheep of stupidity,?
1648,they are more civilized than most and more than canada loser.. but left wing losers like you think government first is being such when its the opposite,?
1649,Yes she is  the same way that DiCaprio got his for his fur coat and grunt and groan display in what for sure was one  of the world's WORST movies...I still regret spending the five bucks I paid to see that idiocy.,?
1650,I've been to Japan a number of times and they know how to build and run rail.    Our rail is poorly planned and poorly managed up until this point.   It's not an alternative    That's just another lie perpetuated bt the pro rail brigade.     If I live in Mililani and my express bus direct to town is cancelled and will now funnel me to the rail  that's not an alternative anymore is it?,?
1651,Nah  he's a clueless buffoon.,?
1652,Here she goes again...why are the ignorant and ill-informed always the loudest and with a "pulpit"?,?
1653,Republicans have shown themselves to be idiotic by going with the town butcher to perform brain surgery.  How is that working out for you republican?  Glad those democrats don't run Government.  Hell  we might have a balanced budget by now.  lol,?
1654,Mueller is as dirty as they come.  Complete scum and all of Washington knows he is scum  especially Senator Graham.     This whole Russia thing is completely fraudulent and all of Washington knows it and many of us know it.  The whole thing was planned.  It's obvious.   https://youtu.be/hlpb3ZXTun8,?
1655,Cultural appropriation is a ridiculous notion.  Sane people should all agree to pay no attention.,?
1656,You're welcome.,?
1657,"The solicitation of public comment by the Board of Education runs the risk of feeling like so many de rigueur “public engagement” exercises of the modern era  where stakeholders are consulted as a courtesy  and responses are interpreted to support whatever the decision-makers have already decided."  Exactly  but  unfortunately "community input" mostly comes from special interest groups  in this case  the HSTA.,?
1658,What connects them?   They are all scam operations run by dishonest hustlers and grifters.,?
1659,Shameful for the Scouts. The den leader made a dumb and illegal decision.  The Scouts are a good organization  but they have waited too long to integrate both sexes.  Marble said all those things since she is a racist. She got caught. Lol.,?
1660,Trudeau and his group wanted the deal done in the dark away from public scrutiny and to make sure the money was judgement-proof from any lawsuit that Khadr's victims might launch.   Trudeau had a choice - to do the right thing and let the courts decide what if any payment Khadr should receive.   Ralph Goodale in trying to explain the duplicitous deal made a complete fool of himself.,?
1661,. Grifters got to grift.  None of them would exist without people who fall for the first bright shiny object they come across.,?
1662,Actually several school boards already have especially those near the border.,?
1663,and so it begins-the dumpster issues a statement that hes against the hatred and violence and we must 'come together as one' BULLSHIT you little orange Hitler-these are YOUR people and they're doing exactly what you encouraged them to do-your army of brown shirts are on the move-and the bloodshed is on YOUR hands,?
1664,Stupid is that stupid does....,?
1665,Damn Obama- couldn't take our guns so your taking our glaciers  huh?  Does  Donald Dump know about this?,?
1666,She must have been an absolute moron. I bet she fails to notice when to stop pouring hot tea  even after it's burning a hole in the top of her foot  too. She goes to the shoe store every week for new shoes because she can't find her old ones (that she's still wearing) and wonders why each week she needs a larger shoe size (so the new ones will slip over the old ones).,?
1667,I'm not sure if the author understands the purpose of a town hall. As I understand it  they provide a forum for constituents and their elected representatives to ask and answer questions  and exchange political views. That is exactly what happened at the Senator's town hall. Although the audience was engaged and occasionally vocal in expressing its opinion  the Senator reacted with grace and good humor. He was able to answer all the questions.  I was surprised at how uniform in opinion the audience appeared. My belief is that the near total absence of conservative voices from the event reflects a sea change in the political opinions of many Alaskans of diverse political backgrounds. Simply put  the vast majority of us disagree with the policies of the GOP  as set forth by Trump and endorsed by Senator Sullivan. Now the Senator knows that. If he loses his job in 2020  he can look back at the town hall to understand the reason why.,?
1668,Gen x'er here.  Interest rates haven't been double digits for close to thirty years.....for most of us that wasn't in our adult/working lifetime  or for only the first couple of years for the oldest of our cohort.  But I agree with t with you on our generation's economic troubles. We've had our share  to be sure.,?
1669,Jules Bailey is still best alternative to Wheeler. #NeverTed,?
1670,That's terrible  because no taxi driver has ever had a criminal history  thanks for your keen insight!,?
1671,I am against racism and all it's forms  your initial comment puts anyone that supports the President as a racist. By offering that dichotomy either against us or with us you fail to acknowledge that Antifa was justified in using violence. I charge that you are being intellectually dishonest in your position. If all good people would ignore the racist pigs and leave them to the dust bin we would not be here now would we. They demonstrated because they knew that Antifa would show up for a fight and they would get plenty of free publicity.,?
1672,No this guy is much worse  just a warmongering liar.,?
1673,Here we go... Stupid driver no 3 of the day. When are these dingleberrys going to get the memo about driving stupid drunk.,?
1674,It's disappointing and cliché to see Ethan want to raise taxes with a budget surplus. God forbid money be saved or credited to taxpayers. I'm also not convinced that throwing money at "agencies" will "help" the local homeless community. A muni payroll homeless "coordinator" has no incentive to reduce homelessness - performing their job effectively puts them out of a job.,?
1675,He's a self-loathing leftist who hates white capitalism and clings to racism to make his point ... soooo obvious,?
1676,But their money spends as well as US dollars..,?
1677,I actually believe in freedom for all (even those I disagree with). You belive that those you disagree with should be forced to submit to your point of view.  Funny that I'm the un-American one here. Funnier still that we probably both agree that morally this baker was wrong (you do too don't you?) but only one of us doesn't believe in his freedom.,?
1678,I don't believe you have back channel info on anything.  As my dear old mum used to say: You sound like a big "I am.",?
1679,Well  I suggest you go sign yourself up or encourage a close friend or family member take a shot. Hope it works out for you/them.,?
1680,Like most people in Ottawa  Chris  you don't understand Western Canada. The NDP vote is what a Western NDP election usually is -- a protest vote. Note that except for a few pockets  the party that people don't vote for are the federal Liberals. It's not because of some ideological stance  it's that the NDP and Conservatives are the only parties that actually listen to Westerners.,?
1681,Ja well no fine  opaque transparency and clarity all round ,?
1682,And the mother of all racists spittles his hate once again.,?
1683,Blacks are renowned for low IQ!,?
1684,I understand that they weren't getting any revenue  but how is that the fault of anyone but their own.  why not let people keep what they were allowed to upload for free  then charge for any extra from there... how dare they just take everyone's pictures away that we were ALLOWED to upload and host for FREE!!!  I think this is absolutely ridiculous.  It's comparable to going to the grocery store and someone at their little booth offering free samples of something and I take one to taste and after I've swallowed and ready to digest they attack me with the Heimlich to take it back because they decided that they needed money instead.  Photobucket ... you are greedy  end of story!,?
1685,Reading this comment  my first thought was "recoveringhomeroid can't take a joke"!  But then I realized s/he not only can take a joke but is going to vote for one.,?
1686,"Glenn Oshiro wasn't making this up on his own  he was satirizing the president-elect's choice of locker room banter. If Glenn Oshiro's post makes you uneasy  please address complaints to the president-elect..."  One wonders how many bigoted  racist  and misogynistic actors will use the "Trump made me do it defense"?  Sloughing toward Gomorrah...,?
1687,your a chicom nut bag communist piece of stupidity  go back and take some more brain washing orders from your masters idiot,?
1688,Sullivan is an ass. And so are his defenders.,?
1689,When people who are eligible today become ineligible later due to this bill's effect  I hope we both agree that those individuals would be losing their access to Medicaid.  Not to be "that guy " but OP technically says "without medicaid access" (and not "without medicaid" as in getting rid of Medicaid).,?
1690,Apparently  you did not get Fr. Martin's message.....,?
1691,Japan should have finished what they started in  the 1930's. Then china would be no more.  Take no crap from them and never cave to thier gutless threats. Trump will destroy those useless commies.,?
1692,Riel was a criminal & a murderer. NOT a martyr!,?
1693,Republicans hate this Ufixit trend. They will outlaw it within 2 yrs.,?
1694,On January 20th  2017  DT ordered all regulatory powers of all federal agencies frozen. * On January 20th  2017  DT ordered the National Parks Service to stop using social media after RTing factual  side by side photos of the crowds for the 2009 and 2017 inaugurations. * On January 20th  2017  roughly 230 protestors were arrested in DC and face unprecedented felony riot charges. Among them were legal observers  journalists  and medics. * On January 20th  2017  a member of the International Workers of the World was shot in the stomach at an anti-fascist protest in Seattle. He remains in critical condition. * On January 21st  2017  DT brought a group of 40 cheerleaders to a meeting with the CIA to cheer for him during a speech that consisted almost entirely of framing himself as the victim of dishonest press.,?
1695,This is a stupid article attacking Catholics  who are a popular target these days because Catholics are pro-adoption and recommend not killing babies  and offer pregnant mothers alternatives instead.,?
1696,Most of the homeless are like that on every island  litter and trash every where they go. Problem on the other islands is that most of the homeless are from the mainland and more keep coming ☹️,?
1697,Aw yes  that oft-used claim by conservatives that liberals are "smug".  I remember fondly how smug you conservatives were when that weasel Harper was in the PMO not taking questions and being contemptuous of Parliament. The the election happened and it wiped the smug off your smug little faces.  Yes  we're the majority in this country.  Always have been.  That's why gay marriage is legal. Liberals made it so  not you.  I will laugh at people like you  until I'm in my grave. Because you suck.,?
1698,what planet of stupid are you on? if the lunatic in NK fires a missle and hits north america   you dam better be sending ours over there to finish them off for good,?
1699,If you are so confident of your opinion  which you clearly are having now repeated yourself several times  with I'm sure  more to come - then why are you not confident enough to use your real identity? I'm not buying your comment  sorry. And without evidence  who knows where your opinion emanates from?,?
1700,Free Trade/NAFTA? The keys to our prosperity for 29 years. It's the Americans complaining about it nowadays. That doesn't bug me much. And in 1988  Liberals and NDPers were almost teary-eyed as they predicted that Canada would become a de facto 53rd state - some even talking about troops crossing the border. Well  once the Liberals got into power  the Chretien government broadened free trade to the NAFTA agreement. And even if the NDP had won the last election  they wouldn't have touched NAFTA because it's worth too much. We are going to be starting talks with the Americans in August (I think). Let's be ready for anything they "throw at us." Go Canada Go!,?
1701,True.....for once UR right. But the thing is  and here is the thing: On his worst day; he makes your best day look bad. REAL bad. And he's a lonely  overbearing  pretentious twit!   So what does that make U?,?
1702,Just how much rent are these featured tenants actually paying now?   And how much will they have to pay if they stay? Seems like essential fact  did I miss something?,?
1703,Bernie Sanders Supporters .............YOU WERE SOLD OUT BY SANDERS to Clinton..According to Sanders everything he said against clinton that you agreed with he now has rescinded .......someone bought you from him  you were pimped out......Don't you love being a captive slave and forced  political prostitute manipulated to be bought and sold to the highest bidder? Sanders turned out to be just another lying hypocritical jerk.......he LIED to you about everything.....,?
1704,@99Bandit  One man's opinion is another man's hate speech,?
1705,So when all the studies show that texting and talking on cells while driving has greatly contributed to the increase vehicular accidents and deaths  Colorado chooses vice over virtue..... Ah  the liberal mind.,?
1706,Unless ... unless ... we use the FAT KIDS as BOMBS .... BRILLIANT!!,?
1707,OMG isn't that the truth. The GOP are the worlds biggest hypocrites and those that follow them blindly are just plain ignorant and uneducated.,?
1708,So why aren't they in favor of readily sharing PUBLICLY available information to do a comprehensive roll comparison. Not social security numbers in part or whole  not any info that is not currently already available.... Why the "resistance"? They are  in fact  hiding that illegals can and regularly have! The operation in Virginia proved that the majority of 60 attempts were not questioned! Check CA  WA  OR  IL  and NY and there you will find the chief culprits of fraud.  That  continual lack of truthful practices and confronting the question of being transparent is why DEMOCRACY is in question.,?
1709,Parents as in 2 people raising him?   I often doubt it  but who knows.   It wouldn't be the first time 2 of 2 are dumb and dumber.  But other sad and  frustrating (to me) scenarios can be the case  too.,?
1710,All the triggered MAGA snowflakes gonna pour in here to bash some immigrants.,?
1711,The libertarians are anti-woman sexists! They want rape to be legal & they want women to pay for their own tampax. That's practically fascism! Triggered!,?
1712,Angela mcanulty you need to rot bitch,?

1714,Why are you assuming that only people than live in the GTA buy houses in the GTA?? Geez people!!,?
1715,It is more than 600 km north of Thunder Bay......in the middle of nowhere with nothing to do. Not sustainable.,?
1716,Everyone should hate sodomy. Christ hates it. He destroyed five cities because of it. The saints and the magisterium hated and condemned it as an abomination  a sin that cries to heaven for vengeance. In Catholic nations people retarded sodomy with revulsion and Catholic governments punished sodomites with the death penalty.,?
1717,It is hoped that the one thing that they have in common is an early death.,?
1718,Obviously you aren't familiar with Uber's business model.  They don't seek to barely undercut taxis  but instead they seek to be cheaper than OWNING a car.  I've recently moved to Dallas and the same reliably $25 Uber trip to the airport is $70 in a cab.,?
1719,“Take their money  drink their liquor  and organize against ’em!”,?
1720,Ultra conservative claptrap bought sink  line  and hooker.,?
1721,"Why would a woman who accused Trump of attempted rape ever go out with him?"  Simply put  Harth is a feckless idiot. If Trump truly did these things to her or forced his hand to her crotch in the restaurant she should have lifted the salad fork from table and nestled it somewhere between Trump's chin and cartilage covering the larynx. In addition  what kind of coward was this boyfriend Houraney  the true testament to this couple of carpetbaggers is how money was more important than attempted rape  cheating and all the other things Mr.Trump did to make Harth feel 'traumatized'.  If Trump did half the things this article says he did then I blame morons like Harth and Houraney for allowing a person  a mere mortal to manipulate and control their lives to the extent they claim  poor  poor little lambs.,?
1722,I think we need to be careful of the old pupule about the Jews killing Jesus. Jesus and all his disciples were jews. It would be like saying that it was those evil Americans that killed Lincoln because Booth was an American.,?
1723,Too bad we won't be seeing Connor McDavid in one of them...The NHL is so stupid...The US team would have had a good chance...what a way to sell the game.,?
1724,Of course you do...... and this mentality is what led to the secrecy behind Adscam,?
1725,Some of these comments are amusing. Here we have the chinese guy whos country has a history of documented human rights violations..... but trump is the problem. But you trip over yourselves to welcome the communist dictatator  and you dont see the hypocrisy of it all. How pathetic.,?
1726,Jealous that a black woman can rake in $500k  while you can't?,?
1727,F*ck cancer.  I'm so sorry.  Just isn't fair.  I'm glad meditation has helped.  I hope treatment can hold the cancer at bay for a long time.,?
1728,Another fact you don't mention Khadr's  life was saved the day he killed Speers  he was laying on the ground bleeding out and the US Medics saved his sorry ass.  That should be enough payment  thank you very much.   No money not a penny should be given to Khadr he should be kissing the ground he was allowed to come back to.,?
1729,Dumb arse's.... use all the type and pics you like.............both the tax hike (state income tax) and or the cut to the PDF hurts ALL ALASKANS.  While the fat cats among us simply think  oh well  its just a small bite out of the pie  no big deal  most Alaskans will feel these actions directly. These will be the genocide of the less fortunate among us. While their payments will be less than those making more  they will pay in other ways  such as paying more products  from gas to groceries because those merchants will raise their prices to off set their additional personal cost.  Cut more!,?
1730,I guarantee the world governments will see much more in money in carbon TAX than the American Petroleum Institute does in profits.  I guess it all comes down to who you trust more.  I guarantee the American Petroleum industry isn't interested in ruling the world.  I can't say that for the EU NWO.  Ask yourself this.  If the world really is in grave danger from man made climate change  then that would be a very extreme situation.  I think you would agree that extreme situations require extreme measures.  I don't see extreme measures being taken by anyone.  Why aren't they taking away our cars?  Why aren't they taking away our electricity?  Aren't these the types of measures you would take if you truly thought the world was in danger?  You need to look no further than the father of "climate change" Al Gore.  He's not living his life like the world is in danger.  He lives in a mansion and flies in private jets.  Doesn't sound like he is very concerned so why should anyone else be?,?
1731,News flash: No one  including the Clintons and Obamas and Bushes and Reagans and Roosevelts and Lincolns and Jacksons and Washingtons  has experience in national politics until they actually do it. Unless you’re in favor of a permanent ruling class.,?
1732,OMG Vancouver sucks.,?
1733,The flip flop man is at it again he just call the guy crazy a couple of days ago now  he is calling him smart.  Trump is crazy the man needs to step down. All of his supporters need to wake up. Trump loves dictators cause he wants to be one. Also where is his taxes! LOCK HIM UP!,?
1734,People of this type need PR folks.  In this case  the first thing they'll do is take away his phone  and tell him to quit reacting and being so defensive.  Defensiveness is a sign of insecurity  and we  the American public  do not need to witness that.,?
1735,Some people are lazy  inconsiderate slobs... I have neighbors who leave their garbage out 24/7.,?
1736,Had he been smart  Few could have shot a black man and walked away scot free.,?
1737,The people that litter and breed fat little litterbugs. Whichever ones those are.,?
1738,Finally some press mentioning the first losing season in a long time. Ganot also has a losing conference record at 8-9. Skeptics all too justified in questioning Ganot's recruiting and coaching ability as this year was his first true team. We all know UH MBB can do so much better and have better recruits and be more competitive and its hardly heresy to say that out loud. If no one complained about Chow he would still be here and now with the change to Rolo we are back on track. Ganot already got turned down by a 4 star recruit this year (and a whole bunch of good players last year) and the boards are empty with other offers or top recruits who have made visits. Ganot goes 0-7 against above average teams who have RPIs of 150 or better. If the predictions had been more conservative and UH picked to finish 5th or 6th after finishing first the cheerleaders wouldn't have much to cheer about.,?
1739,Well  seems like simple criteria-original  well researched.  A lot of people watch reality TV...doesn't mean it's good.,?
1740,I dunno  I kind of think "try rape  you’d like it." to a sexual assault survivor is a bit worse than "same goes for the Harper".  I've known women who have been encouraged to be raped  killed  laughing when their pets died  saying "you live at <address>  I'm coming to rape you" and it goes on and on. I've not known many men who have been told worse.  Walk a mile in their shoes and then judge.,?
1741,When it becomes heresy to even consider thinking about maybe perhaps beginning to question a subject  then that subject is NOT science: it is rabid religion. Faked data and a powerful propaganda machine have convinced our ignorant government representatives to fund this silly obsession.,?
1742,I'm sure they discussed orphans too. As in "If anybody asks what we were talking about  it was orphans",?
1743,where did you see charismatic as a bundy trait? if he had been charismatic   his rag tag group would have received more than a barrel of lube  from the "outside" when they called others "to arms". as far as an uprising goes - it was pathetic.,?
1744,They were all White Idiots   who are making America Great Again. LOL,?
1745,Attempting to normalize Hussein Obama is idiotic. He's a con man and a buffoon. Nothing else  it's who he is  it's what he is.,?
1746,How does a portable ATM not come with GPS tracking to help thwart such a brazen theft when everyone using it is walking around with the same technology in their pockets?,?
1747,if dumb old chump went looking for a bankster  tax manipulator  fraudster  a cancer on humanity's financial affairs  he could not have picked a better candidate to fit the bill.,?
1748,Keep trying to revise history and justify slavery  you racist bigot.,?
1749,You should get over your Clinton butt-hurt  or it's going to be a long 8 years.,?
1750,typical left wing loser  live with less or we will come after you fascist mentality   and yet you get to vote  thats the real problem ,?
1751,What do you expect? His sociopathic kids trophy hunt endangered animals. This family is a cancer on humanity.,?
1752,[citation needed],?
1753,Nothing this clown puts forward is ever going to pass now. It is completely over for this crap show. This ends in impeachment  resignation or the 25th Amendment. This will be beautiful to watch. The crash and burn of the most un-American president ever.,?
1754,Dolan looks like he just passed gas eating the corned beef.,?
1755,That's exactly what's wrong with this way of thinking. It's not unlike what is going on Russia where people think all homosexuals are pedophiles.  Sexuality is a spectrum and it doesn't always have to do with sexual ACTIVITY. The fact that you immediately equate transgender people with being perverted and predatory shows your ignorance. It's insulting  and low.  This isn't a debate about wether or not we should allow sexual predators into bathrooms  it's about accepting that some people actually ARE transgender and have the right to live a lifestyle that matches their sexual identity. This is a debate about the government not having the right to look down people's pants and decide where they belong. It's about individual freedom and civil liberty.   Your boys don't sound transgender  and children of the same gender are just as capable of any sort of sexual assault. Your logic would state every child should have an individual bathroom if that's your concern.,?
1756,You were foolish to experiment. If you have bears that live around you  remove them. They do not belong there.,?
1757,Walker is an idiot.  Calling the Assembly to blame the Legislature.  How lame.  Why not have a backbone and owe up to his mistakes?  Why didn't he spend time explaining why he won't significantly cut state government or put an end to his economically unfeasible and wasteful gas line fantasy project?  Walker can't be recalled soon enough.,?
1758,I'm told  by politicians and drug users    we're going to win this war on drugs with legalization,?
1759,yessireee  that paliwoda guy is never going to get over the election. why  look at these letters just pouring in day after day....you would think he had something else to do.,?
1760,They all want out before the storm and are coordinating with their buddies.   That's all that's going on.  Secret society nonsense.   The real criminals are the idiots crying "Wolf".,?
1761,wow you truly are a nut job left wing idiot. the oil sands are own by consordiums from all over the world idiot.. they provide huge high paying jobs  profits for pension plans  taxes for government  man you really need serious help for your stupidity,?
1762,If - IF - the Rox hold on to the #2 wild card spot  they will play the D-backs in Arizona.,?
1763,You're a black-hearted witch with  a B.,?
1764,Yep.  I've been a big supporter of Trevor last year and this  and was hoping he'd get the start this year to see if he would grow and blossom into a solid starting QB.  For 2 games it looked good.  But from week 3-on it's been a regression.  As of 2 weeks ago I'd seen enough to change my mind on him getting any better.    Worse yet  his weaknesses are a bad fit for this team's weaknesses.  A physical  scrambling QB might be able to mitigate our pass protection problems some  but those are not Trevor's strengths. Neither is quick read or quick release.  It's just turning into a bad fit.  He doesn't balance out the team's weaknesses  he compounds them.    I hate saying that  but it's just becoming more and more clear.  And it gets worse as teams gameplan to exploit them.  It's just time to try someone else. I just wish they'd made the change last week  with 8 days to prepare for the next game  rather than just 5 now.,?
1765,The small amount of people who signed this petition are obviously completely uninformed about Tulsi or are Dem Estab shills.  Complete idiots. 🙄,?
1766,Like the Teachers Union? 1 in 18 could be too many. Bashing yourself  part of the public employees contract.  "The couple left the university and moved to Anchorage  Alaska...She was also a student at Arizona State University  where it was claimed she was a "party-animal."  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Kay_Letourneau,?
1767,"What I did point out is that ALL of OUR pre-historic ancestors were complete morons."  Please define the term "moron".,?
1768,Gosh  why would anyone ever think you to be a racist??!!??  Go Pepe Go  right buddy?,?
1769,What a hypocrite and disappointment Trudeau is.  An entitled rich boy.,?
1770,LOL at this thought - "When will Republicans stop this game of "chicken" and get rid of this fool??" !!!   Just think-then it would be President Pence.  Now that would be really funny. Talk about Shock and Awe!   Oh my!,?
1771,I don't care how much Trump makes. I only care about how much I keep. Make America Le$$ Broke Again.,?
1772,Jeffy  I know reading is not fundamental to Trumpkins  lots of big words and such.  I please see below a link with graphics that show our current immigrant vetting process.  When you dream up or even if Trump dreams up a method of making this process more severe or costly  please post.  It's about a $4K process now  only really well funded Terrorist can afford it  ie. the Saudi Guys funded by bin Laden who actually did damage to us.  There has never been a terrorist attack on the US from any person from the 7 countries that Trump singled out.  https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2015/11/20/infographic-screening-process-refugee-entry-united-states,?
1773,The scumbags opposing Trump have made a grave miscalculation with this particular stratagem.  If real people did leak Trump's (perfectly legitimate) choice  there are only so many who it could be.  Hopefully they will be identified and charged.  Meanwhile  the blowhard idiots trying to make this look bad on Trump are revealed as utterly spiteful and destructive.,?
1774,Yeah those Leftist Marxist Anti-Fa's Boy  are they are scum,?
1775,They are a both loosers.,?
1776,This is utterly ridiculous censorship when you can't use the word r.e.t.a.r.d.e.d in context.  This paper is a true piece of g.a.r.b.a.g.e.,?
1777,Good idea. Can't help but feel that the rent on such a building would be a prohibiting factor for most small shops though.,?
1778,Ritter was pond scum. I assume there was a bribe or sexual favor with that pardon.,?
1779,I wonder if republicans  especially mitch-my only goal is to make him a one term president-mcconnell is secretly wishing they were dealing with BO.  I mean it was so easy to disrespect and obstruct him; like him or not  he never really fought back  fought dirty bu was class and dignity through it all. And now here they are eating their young  45 is publicly disrespecting/belittling mcconnell even as mitch fights to give him what he wants.  Karma?,?
1780,the ignorance your people like you is as usual sick. she like trump is doing just fine and doing good work for the benefit of the usa.,?
1781,Is that what dailykos and mother jones told you to believe today?,?
1782,wow more of the usual nonsense  the President is using his authority as mandated by law   get over it,?
1783,Attitudes must change  huh.  Right on  quit sucking up to them.,?
1784,Not good enough you PR morons.,?
1785,7th inning  bases loaded  nobody out  1 run already in on a bases-loaded BB  and....squat.  Pearce Ks  Tulowitzki hits into a 5-4-3 dp  3 outs  inning over.  Yeah  Your Js won  hardly deserving  they weren't good  but Oak was worse.  No idea what Davis is doing trying to steal 3rd in the 1st inning.  Pure stupidity.  May have cost his team the game.,?
1786,Trump is great feel sorry for the guy....he knows what's going on and will try to mitigate 50 years of stupidity,?
1787,The Donkeys lost today  they don't care as long as they got their "protest" on TV. The game is secondary. Pathetic.,?
1788,Trump. Trump. Trump. Stuck on stupid.  Another dumb Hawaiian?,?
1789,Yes JT  just plow ahead with the same insane policies that destroyed Ontario's economy...the stupidity of this man knows no bounds.,?
1790,lol Sheepie .. yeah right .. if Hillary had won and the CIA and FBI and NSA was saying that Russia had helped her  you'd be calling for an armed insurrection to kick her out and install Trump in her place .. you're so blindly partisan it'd be laughable if it wasn't so pathetic,?
1791,Why don't you offer him a room at your place  silly old Peggy?,?
1792,proof that looking good is not enough to be a leader  going into their third year already  and zilch  less talk more action please,?
1793,It's how you identify that matters.,?
1794,Ditto here. RFK in 1964 Senatorial race and 1968. Part of me died with him.,?
1795,Fuck you!!!! He got it off himself and I know it for a fact stop calling him a fool or I'll show you what pain feels like,?
1796,Yup  Detective GotIt  that proves it  without a doubt. Dang  I shouldn't have given away this totally obscure secret that students at universities write essays that are graded. My mistake.,?
1797,...and the parties  responsible for the mess  remain "at large".  Pensions/pay intact.  Sounds like what happened on Wall Street.     Everything's all better now.  Move along nothing to see. /s,?
1798,Beautifully written  but full of bs and nonsense. Far  hard right extremists" would like their children to get a good education at a lower cost just like all people that care about the future of our country. Is that too much to ask?,?
1799,Your extreme environmentalist anti oil blather is nothing more than nauseating non-nonsensical over the top hypocritical hype. Yes BP screwed up  so did Exxon  and Joe Hazelton. And the company leaders should be publicly flogged  and put in prison. Now move on Sarah  go back to your teepee in the woods  and get over it already!!,?
1800,It`s to their credit they didn`t vet it?..,?
1801,What the hell are you talking about?,?
1802,Boomers are despicable.,?
1803,You're just jealous  anonymous-commenter-who-has-something-to hide. If I was going to shoot someone I'd have to have gun.  And I don't have a gun because I'm not a coward afraid of  my shadow. Or a devotee of The Lyin' King and the reprehensible GOP.  To dumb it down for you  I'm not stupid. There. That sums it up nicely "AtheO.",?
1804,I guess I'm a dinosaur but this whole debate makes me groan and roll my eyes.  Talk about first world problems!,?
1805,I wonder what the pro-pesticiders will do when the last bee is killed from neonics ...  The argument that we must spray the life out of our planet because the population in some regions is exploding is nonsense!!  The Earth is a closed loop  and it will become one vast Easter Island  unable to sustain life.     We might as well lace drinking water now with birth control drugs ... pro-pesticiders don't think that synthetic estrogens do anything  anyway  and maybe the population will stop growing ...,?
1806,Yuck...  I suppose if all of this pandering (by Canadians of all political stripes) is being done to keep Canada out of Trumps gun-sight  it may be worth it  but I somehow doubt it will always last  or work.  And while Mulroney sang  there is historical precedent (president? hahaha) for it  and there was apparently a charity component to it  lets' draw the line there. I don't want to hear of Sophie singing (again  ever  anywhere)...please.,?
1807,Mr. DeMarben.   In the future please include information that specifies how these state funded exploration efforts will ultimately culminate in the sale of oil with subsequent state revenues.   Please provide additional information including how the oil will be sent to market (e.g. existing pipelines) and who is committed to purchase this "new" oil. Thanks.,?
1808,We are everywhere Eric - You probably don't even know we are there.,?
1809,Meh on Kaepernick - certainly better than QB on the roster  but if he's not a LONG-TERM solution  then I don't care. He's not taking this team to the playoffs.  Regarding Joseph...have to wait it out. There's no advantage to firing him  at least at this point. It's pathetic how far they've fallen after it looked like we have huge coaching advantages in Weeks 1 and 2.,?
1810,I largely agree  but there is an argument that in SA  with out legacy of apartheid spatial planning (the working poor live on the outskirts  a liong and expesnsive commute away from where the work is)  public transport is a public good.  Marianne Merten in another piece tries to suggest that electricity is a public good - THAT I totally disagree with (neither is LP gas  nor petrol  nor diesel a public good!),?
1811,Can we count the druggies in; the executive board room;  behind the bank desk;  owners of  the local  store; politicians of both parties (can they look worse?).  We need to stop thinking only of street drugs.  Drugs are rampant through our society.   You and I have already talked about the Wall Street drugs for instance and we both know drugs have been in the board room since we had alcohol cabinets in the CEO offices in the Rat Pack era.   Power avoids the camera's. the 'the Harvey Feinstein class'  only add drugs to the sex.  I'm actually pretty libertarian about drugs.  It's the hypocrisy of shaming those who use street drugs versus 'approved' prescription drugs that seems unfair.  At least Kesey produced writings that are recognized as outstanding contributions to our national trove of literature.   Not many folks can lay claim to that.,?
1812,Which video  the one where the cops are seen punching poor Dr. Dao  or the one of him being dragged out - UNCONSCIOUS ??? Ronin006  you are obviously one of these self righteous citizens that regards himself as perfect. You probably think it's ok to beat your wife and kids if they misbehave  beat your dogs until they're screaming because they defecated in the wrong spot  and believes cops are justified in shooting a jaywalker !! I believe in the Webster dictionary  you'd be the definition of FASCIST   !!!,?
1813,The government opened the first liquor store in Nunavut 2 days ago. Does Trudeau think this will help heal the past?,?
1814,You must be new around here.  No subject can be discussed in the Trump Era without "squabbling over which party did what " especially when the underlying message is that Trump exists because of ignorance.,?
1815,ericnorstog  IF  and I say IF  I was God  and when you come before me for final judgement  I would cut off your male sex organ  and if you are a woman  I would stitch up your pusey.,?
1816,It's time to change the 2nd Amendment.,?
1817,Like you  you mean? You're as trollish as they come. Actually--and I know this will be news to you--the fact that someone doesn't agree with you doesn't make them a troll  it makes them informed.,?
1818,Believing in transubstantiation "because the Pope says so" is just as stupid as believing the earth is four thousand years old "because the Bible says so." Both are simply political self-interest couched in supernatural blather.,?
1819,Thank you for your comment  but I disagree. Yes  it's the role of the legislature to appropriate  and I understand that you believe they haven't appropriated enough; however  it's the job of the Administration to wisely spend those funds in the best manner.   Do you honestly think this stretch of road doesn't require maximum AST coverage? Art very well sums up in the below comment how a poor leader budgets their resources: cut where it will hurt the public the most  and then people (like you JW907) will complain to the legislature that there's not enough funding. Your elected official caves-in and appropriates more cash.....I like to call that the 'snowball effect' as it  the state's budget  keeps rolling downhill and getting larger and larger...,?
1820,Thank you   Science duck.  Life can sometimes become dire  for months at a time.  Entertainment becomes serious business  as with the issue of the future of the United States.  As a noted author wrote  "Things Fall Apart" (which see).  Each of us gets caught in the mortality trap  sooner or later  and then we have to deal with it.  At this time  lightning has struck  not me  but someone close to me.  I offer up prayer  but of course one's friends sometimes take up all one's spare time.  I like to joke around  but all around us  as anyone can see  is chaos and death. We deal with tragedy  sometimes. No joking. Hope I don't spoil anyone's party.  While we live  let's laugh!,?
1821,The people that elected Trump are out in force in the ADN comment section. They are labelling anything they disagree with as "uncivil". I've had 3 comments that "didn't meet the civility threshold"...all because I used the terms racists  white supremacists and Nazis. They were all rejected because the self-proclaimed racists  white supremacists and Nazis didn't like to be called racists  white supremacists and Nazis. ADN...your civil comments section is a mockery.,?
1822,Whatever happened to that federal investigation of the Kealoha's anyway?,?
1823,I'm surprised by the "bare ass" testimony.  Does she not wear underwear?,?
1824,Canadian health care system outperforms Germany’s in seven measures examined: mortality amenable to health care  two of three measures of cancer survival  one of three measures of in-hospital mortality  and all three measures of primary care performance.  We do study these things.  Its not as clear as you suggest.,?
1825,Agreed!  It not only grandstands the fact that Springfield has an identity crisis  -not knowing who they are  it's placed on an exit where no-one would have a clue that they entered a place called 'Springfield'.  Ill conceived.,?
1826,When you build a stadium  you need to plan for people to do dumb stuff like sit on railings after consuming drinks. It's not that hard to idiot-proof a stadium  and now the stadium will pay big bucks for their negligence.,?
1827,How about FUCK NO. If anything Canada should learn from America's example and start smartening up before this country is overrun by Muslims and Chinese who don't want to learn English.,?
1828,You must be high to really believe that. Obama wasn't even the president when ithe collapse happened. You'd have a bit more credibility if you believed Bill Clinton caused it. It could be argued that many of his administration's legislation regarding loan practices remained during the Bush years and were contributing factors.,?
1829,Just look at how nasty comments have gotten and tell me Trump supporters shouldn't be tracked as potential terrorists. They're ignorant  armed to the teeth and looking for an excuse. They are not going away when Clinton is elected President of the United States.,?
1830,Horrendous? I think her choices are quite fetching considering what she donned in the 90's.,?
1831,Dual citizenship should be banned. Either you are  Canadian or you are not. One foot in and one foot out is not a good practise.,?
1832,Trudeau  go crawl back in the hole you came from. Quit being such a brown nosing suck to all women  especially the muslims,?
1833,Bike taxes were common in the 70's - you had to register and attach a number (was a plate then a sticker) to identify and prove ownership if stolen. Wasn't free  was 10 bucks or so which in today's economy is more like $30,?
1834,No Ben and Jerry for me.....,?
1835,Maybe the solution is to bring in drinking water  and simply pipe in untreated water for laundry and other such purposes. It is uneconomic to operate a water treatment plant for a community of 300  when you need at least 2 (main and backup) qualified operators to keep monitoring the system.,?
1836,Why isn't Hussein brought up on charges for cooking the books and breaking immigration laws.  Ah crap he be black,?
1837,Brown is a moron.,?
1838,He slashed at someone with a knife and went after a cop with a hammer. Hammers are used as deadly weapons. Too bad the friend didn't shoot him first.,?
1839,What's ridiculous is women claiming to have any understanding whatsoever of what masculinity is or means to a man. Shall we call it womansplaining?  That's what's ridiculous.,?
1840,Only one way to handle a terrorist.  Kill the SOB.,?
1841,BUT  the nation  or at least what appears to be a very loud  vast and diverse majority of the nation  (including GOP leaders)  coalesced and united AGAINST Trump.  Interesting Trump would let the nation unite against him.  Especially on this issue.  It doesn't just go away.  It may be a new political gut ckeck.  Kinda stupid  actually.  What does this portend?,?
1842,up front....lol.  The only thing that he can be up front about is that he is a P**** grabbin' liar!  aloha,?
1843,Its time you farmed out non wanted Nation guys to the Marlies... Nobody wants your garbage around the league.,?
1844,This woman is like that idiot dad...  now an idiot mom.  Quit politicizing your son's death you fool.  Dems will chew you and spit you out like they did with Weinstein..,?
1845,roll another one  wow just wow,?
1846,What an idiotic comment.   Do you consider the fact that $15 / hour in Toronto is not the same as $15 / hour in North Bay. Wages in smaller communities are generally lower because the cost of living is less. This is gong to have a negative affect on smaller communities.  Apparently we have a Toronto centric crowd here  hat cannot conceive of living anywhere else.,?
1847,War shouldn't be the first answer but with Republicans it usually is. I wonder how many in the National Guard thought they'd be going to Iraq and Afghanistan? Not many I would think since they hadn't been used that way before. Thanks  GW. No  Davis  I'm not saying our soldiers are stupid. I'm saying our leaders are.,?
1848,Annihilate means kill them all  not carpet bomb  bozo.,?
1849,The dotard moron is the biggest fraud of all time!   Trump vilified China all during his campaign for president.   After he becomes president - he goes over to China to lick the bottom of the dictator's shoes and blames America for the reason they 'rape' us.    Donald Trump calls most Americans his enemy.  He condemns all Democrats - most Republicans.  The First Amendment  the NFL  etc.  But he LOVES LOVES LOVES evil dictators.   Big 'tough' negotiator.  He came back from China with no deal and a brown nose!,?
1850,Getting rid of Ward for this season is a mistake.,?
1851,Stupid stupid stupid.. These guys just don't know how to shut up.. Now it is the lawyer  and he just opened up a WHOLE NEW can of worms.  Donald Trump Jr DID NOT have Secret Service protection at that time. Nor did Trump Towers. None of those guys did. Candidate Trump  his spouse and child just started receiving their personal detail protection shortly before  and the only time the SS would have had anything to do with Donald Trump Jr is if Mr Trump was near by... And the President has claimed he wasn't.  Lawyers.. Good ones  know to never offer any information that isn't asked of them or their clients.. EVER.. It is kind of the 1st rule of Defense.,?
1852,éh?,?
1853,Another fine waste of tax payer's dollars by Democrats. Only people getting rich out of this will be lawyers on your dime. And oh yeah  two Democratic State AGs will get free advertising and name recognition for future political runs and law firm name recognition. It never ceases to amaze me how straight up stupid Democratic Voters are.,?
1854,Treasonous Buffoon strikes again.  The rich spoiled brat hasn't a brain functioning at all.  Time for revolution to end this reign of the Republican Terrorist Traitor Party fouling the entire governing system to the point of treason with a foreign enemy.,?
1855,The only way its works is for the voter to vote for one or at tops two candidates. period.,?
1856,A RINO becoming a liberal is welcome ? Not if you're a conservative. What an ignorant piece. Not surprising but.............it's the Pitts......,?
1857,DeVos is an ignorant and subversive disgrace to her office.,?
1858,I don't have as much time as you so go look for it.  Google.,?
1859,It's hard to imagine anything more pathetic.,?
1860,Alaska is getting 100% Medicaid expansion reimbursement through 2017. Then it drops to 90% and stays there forever  unless the GOP succeeds in changing it.,?
1861,He has a DB Plan?  I see he has a DC plan and a LIRA.  The article does state Marcus does not have a pension plan.,?
1862,I agree with this editorial. But there is a fairly obvious double standard at work here. We have a free trade agreement with another major human rights abusing Middle Eastern regime which uses extreme force against millions of people under its control. I'm referring to Israel  of course. The Canada-Israel FTA does not even require goods coming out of occupied Palestine from Israeli settlements to be labeled as such  an omission that violates international law. So long as we continue to coddle Israel and run interference for its brutal occupation of Palestine  we don't have much moral authority when it comes to criticizing any other state.,?
1863,No doubt getting your butt kicked in the process.,?
1864,Jason Kenney is a disgusting individual.,?
1865,You have no idea what you are saying - all I can think of is you have either experienced Chum salmon or the chef destroyed the salmon you ate.  That said  anyone that pays over $6 / lb is a fool.,?
1866,"It's really annoying how those damn social democracies in Scandinavia keep outperforming everybody at everything"  your exact words above. You seems to not have very firm political morals and principals jumping and moving as the debate changes. This is an article by Ivo on the conference just ended in Durban and their scheme for the world's poor etc. He takes it apart and you somehow have meandered everywhere (especially into your socialist vs capitalist topic  are you not tired of it by now?) except answering specifically his points  good or bad. Your last line sums up you confusion. So USA coal killls 200k people a year (zero facts/figurs/explanations etc) and presumably the other coal countries (bigger and smaller plus SA) coal does not kill people?. Stick to articles subject and keep consistent.  How many people does SA's coal industry kill per year and what are you doing abvout it?,?
1867,Think I'll get me a Karelian bear dog...keep those dang moose at bay!,?
1868,Suckstobeyou: sounds like ur a jealous phyco path. Get a life! Abusive boy friend hahahaha good one! Don't blame someone else for someone else's fuck ups!!!!,?
1869,Well  turns out I was wrong  the Dallas shooter wasn't BLM. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_shooting_of_Dallas_police_officers As for the riots  they tend to call themselves anarchists  but are the same idiots as the antifa fools.,?
1870,And a hypocrite  I would add.,?
1871,MR. BRETT  THIS WAS THE MOST BORING AND UNINFORMATIVE PIECE CB HAS EVER POSTED. WHY WOULD I BUY THIS GARBAGE? BRETT IS DESPARATE TO CREATE SOME SENSATIONAL PIECE AND TOTALLY LOST HIS WAY. BRETT  YOU SORELY NEED A TRIP TO THE ARIZONA MEMORIAL AND LISTEN.  THE PEACE KEEPING MISSION STARTS WITH A VILLAGE AND THE WILLINGNESS FOR OPEN DIALOG. YOU ARE THE PROBLEM  UNABLE TO CHANGE A MINDSET THAT ENCOURAGES FRICTION.  TIME FOR PROFESSIONAL INVESTIGATIVE REPORTING  COME BACK WHEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING WORTH READING.  HERES SOME INFO FOR YOU - TELSI GOT YOUR GOVERNMENTS BLESSINGS TO CONDUCT A FACT FINDING VISIT!,?
1872,It's old news . . .  Eugene schools have been doing it for the last 12 years. Not one school in the Midwestern league is double the size of NB.,?
1873,More like Beetlejuice  a rude and crude parasite with no discernible moral values whose biggest fan is himself.,?
1874,Poloz has no control whatsoever  over 10 year GoC yields...believe me... The overnite rate and the Loonie (to a degree) Meanwhile regarding higher rates... a little belt tightening has to happen sooner or later. Hopefully starting with Federal Provincial and Municipal governments. Cheap money has turned more than just many Canadian businesses into complete idiots....,?
1875,The "powers that be" include your sector too  Steven. The way the cruise  industry lobbies to remove head taxes acceptable all over the world but not here  for instance. It's called big money and its disproportionate power over a small population such as ours. Their vertical-integrating and extortionate actions in compelling independent vendors to give them a large cut of the action is indicative of the predatory nature of both them and the oil industry model of gross exploitation. It was at 35% on Juneau even 20 years ago. I don't find your posts amusing at all. Rather  I consider them tendentious in their lack of a larger awareness of the world  a lack of worldview you repeat in all of them. And they contribute to Alaska's going down the drain. Your certitude and what I perceive as a lack of imagination undermines your cant. I'm sure you're a nice person other than that. BTW  what do you think about this? C'mon  your turn to "humor" me. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCL2d8lLYXw,?
1876,How about we lay $1 000 on the table about my residency.  Put up or shut up.,?
1877,I like looking at McConnell's face in the pic. The face of ineptitude  of hackdom  of the impoverished Trump tenure (however brief).,?
1878,Thank you Kenneth Wilson for the rest of the story.,?
1879,He also pulled his dick out a few times lol but really,?
1880,Tiny digits Drumpf  Dr. Strange-glove  a satanic blustering  outrageous fabricator of  lies  blatantly untrustworthy  and the personification of the boy who called wolf   leader of the free world (Ha!) is going to get us all killed.  It's unfortunate  because Seoul is my favourite city in the world.,?
1881,Don't want him to shoot your mother do ya?,?
1882,You're just irritated that no one believes a word your buffoon says (except you).,?
1883,Most conservative Americans are marginally literate  do not understand the USA constitution  and are  as a result  extremely gullible to a skilled conman like Trump.   Labeling the mass media as "elitist" is an admission of how ignorant your view is regarding the role of the FREE press. Trump is a "fake" president and you are a sucker for supporting this idiot and his attempt at making the USA a dictatorship. Not on my watch.,?
1884,It would be a good idea to mention that after an attack like this  the head of the animal should be sent in for analysis  to see if the rabies virus is present.  The "after the bite" injections are intra-abdominal & quite painful & if not necessary can be avoided.,?
1885,Hopefully these scumbags never get to set foot on the streets of Denver again.  Prison seems like an appropriate place for them.,?
1886,People need to stop apologizing to morons,?
1887,That is ridiculous.,?
1888,I'm for anything that gets rid of Texans...,?
1889,When asked if they were going to screw over other stores  Chambers avoided the question and essentially stated that because they can and because she's a stupid  beeotch they're going to concentrate exclusively on marijuana stores.,?
1890,Too bad ... Always talking trash.,?
1891,All democrats are liars and they all prove their stupidity by believing fake news.,?
1892,What a moron.,?
1893,And of course the irony is that he's the one who is "privileged"  having had a fortune handed to him and grown up in a bubble.,?
1894,May these miserable thieving A-holes justice be swift  merciless & devastating! To steal from the poorest of the poor to fund a tacky tasteless arranged wedding leaves a special place in Hindu hell for them all!,?
1895,Knee-jerk criticism of Trudeau over this is ridiculous. For one thing  Brazeau was a token Indigenous appointment by the Harper regime. And he was a Conservative -- supporting the government that was antithetical to Indigenous and most other people's interests.  If you want to criticize Trudeau on the First Nations file -- and I do -- call him out for trampling on land rights in promoting pipelines and mining  failing to remedy water dangers on reserves and failing to deal nation to nation.  Beating Brazeau in a boxing ring was one of the few good things he did in that campaign.,?
1896,Here in Richmond BC  about one birth a day in our local hospital is to a non resident.  Last year all but four were to mothers of Chinese nationality. We have illegal birthing hotels set up in the City for the sole purpose of providing pre and post natal care  and helping of course with the paperwork.   Mothers pay the hospital about $7000 for a regular delivery  and about 12 000 for a C-section. No doubt middle-man fees add more to that.  Because of Canada's ten year renewable visitors visas  parents can stay and raise their children here.,?
1897,Trinidad  you are correct except that these people are convicted prisoners.  So the State at it's discretion may house these individuals as they see fit.  Like you  I do not agree with the States policy of paying for incarceration at private venues.  That is wrong. The only good thing about it is that these people should have had counsel and a trial if they chose to have one.  These people have had due process of the law. They should include a remain in Hawaii clause as part of any sentencing plea agreement made with the government.  I want them brought home.... it is the right thing to do.  I do see your point.  The long line fishing industry runs a state funded and sanction prison at pier 18-21 and 36-38.  These men are illegally in the United States but they are imprisoned by the state and kept to work as slave labor (human trafficking victims) to serve the wishes of the Hawaii Long Line Association.  No trial  no medical  no spiritual counseling.  Smuggling humans for profit.,?
1898,How pathetic.  Now repubs lie and tell us that trump won the people's vote.  Is that you Hair Twitler?  "Most" of us voted for Hillary.  Quit pretending otherwise  liar.  I see that you changed your screen name once more.  Banned again  were you?,?
1899,The Leaside where we raised our Family exists on a map but is an alien world from what we knew. Monster additions to family homes and people prepared to pay $2 million plus for a 35X120 ft lot bear no similarity to our former neighbours. Upwardly mobile career obsessed it is no longer a warm family neighbourhood but status oriented wealth comparing social aspirants.,?
1900,Gee whiz   Charlie.  That would be like Ali Baba and his forty thieves getting run outta town only to be replaced by Caligula.,?
1901,Embraer's entire existence is based on Government support. The Brazilian Air Force (read Government) fully funded the KC-390 transport plane. 1.5 billion and counting.  Embraer has no risk on the contract. If you look at their promotional material on the upgraded E-2 jets how they have transferred all this new technology that came from the KC-390.,?
1902,I know what you mean!  It's kinda like how Trump's campaign was organized and run by Russians and Russian operatives  not Americans and how Trump just retweets the fake news and misinformation his KGB betters feed him to the detriment of this nation's health.  The patterns in current events are so unexpected sometimes!,?
1903,This morning: Donald J. Trump‏Verified account @realDonaldTrump  6h6 hours ago  Crazy Joe Scarborough and dumb as a rock Mika are not bad people  but their low rated show is dominated by their NBC bosses. Too bad!  Donald is obsessive-compulsive in addition to his narcissism and psychosis. He just can't calm his troubled mind.  Donald J. Trump‏Verified account @realDonaldTrump  6h6 hours ago  I am extremely pleased to see that @CNN has finally been exposed as #FakeNews and garbage journalism. It's about time!  You just can't give it up  can you Donald? You really need to get some professional mental health therapy. If you truly consider Fox and Infowars as real news  you need help. At least do something to get get the wads out of your panties.,?
1904,Not just uneducated  wilfully ignorant  which equates to stupid in my book. Frankly  I don't care what happens to them. Hopefully survival of the fittest will kick in at some point and relieve the planet of the burden of these morons. I can't wait.,?
1905,this is so unbelievably unreal.  we must be that stupid...we keep falling for the same old baloney over and over.  this whole community is so going to profit off of something very demographically specific like a track meet.  even after we start ponying up all those hidden expenses  we're all going to benefit.   baloney - and the oh  we this and that   is just beginning.,?
1906,When your swing normally looks like an octopus falling out of a tree  it's difficult to tell when something is wrong.,?
1907,Tell you what.....direct all Liberal fundraising money  political donations  AND contributions given to the TrueDope Foundation and your daddy's statue to reduce your idiotic deficit and we might be able to think about not calling you the stupidest goof in Canada...... even though you are.  This is simply getting ridiculous how the failed drama teacher tries to justify something so unethical. It makes your skin crawl trying to picture how this egomaniac thinks Canadians will agree to this.,?
1908,As usual you've proved yourself a complete idiot  with tenure to a minor university that hires left overs,?
1909,Trump adviser Steve Bannon profited from a business relationship with Weinstein before he slammed Democrats for taking donations from the movie mogul. Just watch as the right wing blasts Bannon for sidling up next to a pervert. Make that two perverts  counting the sexual predator Trump.,?
1910,540 000 barrels of oil a day and we are paying them to pump it.  Tough to take.,?
1911,Three complete idiots  now of the streets.,?
1912,I was at the “star chamber” proceedings. I have transcripts of the two day hearings. It was not a contested case hearing. The hearings officer was the Chair of the Hawaii State Ethics Commission. It was a classic Kangaroo court. I requested representation for myself and another employee of the school through the Attorney General’s Office. The proceedings were interrupted both days through organized efforts to intimidate witnesses. When the first incident was brought to the attention of the Chair  Leslie Kondo said  “Just for the record  I mean  I’m not here to defend Mr. Gomes  but just for the record  this is a public hearing by law.” The Chair allowed the Mr. Gomes to remain. The following day  Mr. Gomes sat right behind William Boyd as he was being questioned. As William Boyd answered the questions  Mr. Gomes kept whispering  “liar!” This incident again was brought to the attention of the Chair. She again refused to ask him to leave the proceedings.,?
1913,Good grief - Waterloo used to be a respected institution but a Professor of Spectacles?  You couldn't make up this garbage.,?
1914,Damn Dieter  You are batting a thousand Baby!! Keep it up.l,?
1915,What a great opportunity for a local girl to be molested by our SprayONBack Gorilla of a president. Perhaps Trump will GRAB HER BY THE PUSSY! J.k. Congradulations Mrs Waldron. Please use this platform to adress real issues :). I wish you luck  and stay away from the oval office!,?
1916,"Her “husband” raped many women: ask them." This trash is worthy of a flag.,?
1917," ... until then it is a parasite "  ===  Wow.,?
1918,One to hold the tray of coffee and donuts?,?
1919,Heart breaking to hear about this young man  My condolences to the family. This young man was depending on adults to officiate this run  where is the common sense that goes with that responsibility ?  The bears instinct is to chase  prey so placing so many on a trail to RUN in bear country is beyond Idiocy !  Leave Nature in the Bush and people espeacilly green horns in the city!,?
1920,Would you prefer they do the Mandan dance?  Notice I didn't say "silly" out of respect for their culture.,?
1921,"America...almost single handedly defeated Nazism". I think the  uh  entire rest of the world would tend to disagree with that assessment. Nobody claims that the US didn't help  but the notion that we were even the main contributor to victory in WWII was invented during the jingoistic early days of the cold war  and has been constantly  consistently  and thoroughly discredited ever since.,?
1922,amela I am talking about last year when the coaches go on a recruiting trip during the season to get good recruits to come here   we lost a few better recruits than these ones a week ago but because of the long delay these better recruits went to other schools to play  that's what I was talking about should have explained it better in my first comment.,?
1923,Since there are no known situations of this that have happened in Anchorage  why has this become another Anch Baptist Temple/AK Family Action target?  This gets worse everytime this "FOOL" or this bunch starts another petition.  I'm sorry  but I have absolutely no use for this bigoted group.,?
1924,stupid is as stupid does.....and trump is.........,?
1925,This is an example of how stupid liberals have made the entire country. It's a harmless sign. If it truly motivates sexual assaults  then how many has it caused? Let's all be offended........,?
1926,Dems in DC = so many dirty  sick mfers  that is why they have no agenda to improve our country  only want to lower us  ala Barack the clown.,?
1927,America first?   Winning?   He should fire himself.,?
1928,But the right keeps telling us that any and all criticism of Bozo is just because "sore losers" need a "safe space" and  anyway  "he won the election".    According to what passes to their thought process  anyone  no matter how awful  inexperienced  unqualified and incompetent  who happens to get selected by the EC  should be something that is tolerated for 4 years. Well  at least if they are a Republican.    I may have voted for Hillary  but if the EC selected her instead  and she did even 1/10th of what Bozo is doing  I'd be calling for impeachment of her as well.,?
1929,You are an uneducated embarrassment to Alaska.,?
1930,Still in denial and nothing but seeing the negative in people ... what a real treat you are.,?
1931,If by "triggered" you mean finding amusement in a book written by a sore loser  then I guess so.,?
1932,Muslims are the worst Islamophobics of all . Ancient hatreds and wars of extermination between Kurds  Shiite  Sunni  Wahhabi  Druze and other Islamic sects are worse than anything expressed in the west  even by Trump.,?
1933,Hi  Mother Theresa. Oh  that's right  you won't live in abject poverty to promote your beliefs  hypocrite. You just annoy people on the internet.,?
1934,First thing I would cut is ties with the lobbyist! Some are x legislators influencing  conspiring  existing legislators to vote for the oil companies maybe with the promise they to would become lobbyist!! Remember some of the legislators that the F.B.I. arrested admitted on tape that they would keep voting for oil companies agenda with the promise of becoming lobbyist!!! When is this shit going to stop!!! If we didn't have all this corruption Alaska could be 100 billion times richer and drill our own oil  but that's why  big oil controls our legislators!!!!!,?
1935,Oscar at dmv denied us one.  Saying it was offensive yet allows naked. Im confused. I see horrible ones yet the one wanted was not offensive. I also applied for plates for an old boss and they said those were offensive yet we saw them in another vehicle a few months later. Our dmv decision makers are just plain stupid.,?
1936,Kick the running dog Chinese Imperialists out! Free Tibet!,?
1937,I should be surprised by this lack of basic respect  but I'm not.  It is endemic  it seems  to those under 30.  Even those OVER 30 and who should know better  but don't seem to care.  This is no different than the controversy with Kaepernik:  Self-centeredness  narcissism  idolatry of self.,?
1938,Donald Trump is measuring drapes for the Oval Office  rumor has it that he called Joe Miller for tips....,?
1939,An eagle soars high  a bit of advice..... don't mess around with wolves.. your a dipshit deluxe and not really worth time.. what an IDIOT!,?
1940,Not really  it jumps into unethical controls that the faithful have demonstrated their faith by not keeping these rather stupid ideas of celibate men...,?
1941,psst  bud look in the mirror and read what you posted!   Hate  insults etc the childish stupidity of a true  DB.. lets see how long before your post is taken down!,?
1942,If only all conservatives be such clowns but sadly most conservatives are complete hypocrites.,?
1943,Good for You!,?
1944,As are those of the SJW industry....,?
1945,IHS runs the only level 2 trauma center in the state  with good outcomes.  Why hasn't the private market seen fit to do that?,?
1946,I didn't dodge the draft. Shoot the traitor.,?
1947,NFL what a bunch of anti-american haters.  Sorry this country and our hard earned dollars made you so rich that you feel like you have to shove our faces in your BS protest.  Guess what?  I like cops  our veterans  our country  our forefathers  our way of life better than I like any of you losers.  Go F yourself,?
1948,Blowjob Bradley!,?
1949,The accused will now be automatically guilty  no trial for the accused will be necessary so lets just go directly to the sentencing hearing.,?
1950,Have you not yet discerned that opinion is simply...opinion?  Again  there have been many peer reviewed  journal-published estimations of AGW consensus. There have been even more blog-site and popular (amongst some) media  imagined refutations of these estimations. At some point you need to reconcile your apparent assertion that there exists no scientific consensus with the fact that there is no scientific body in the world that rejects AGW theory. You might additionally ponder why you are so committed to denial of that consensus.  Consider learning something about climate science. Upon doing so  you will understand why that consensus exists.,?
1951,Then apparently it's boneheaded to place two confrontational groups together with inadequate safety measures in place.,?
1952,Oh please!  Get over yourself along with your arrogant  petty perceptions of regional disparity and injustice... with your comment  you blatantly typify the selfish stereotype of an arrogant and out-of-touch lotus-lander.  The fact is that BC has done far more to hinder and obstruct the economy of Canada than the other way around.  It's borderline treasonous  especially given the fact that were BC to have a huge earthquake  along with a huge hit to its economy  I doubt that the rest of Canada would ever be quite so isolationist  unsupportive and uncooperative in terms of helping fellow British Columbians to rebuild and get their economy back on track.  Too bad the selfish lotus-landers can't see fit to reciprocate!,?
1953,I like the approach of compassion rather that segregation. What if there were showers and laundry facilities?,?
1954,That jerk should lose his business. Then he can beg for his coffee money like the loser he is.,?
1955,Simon and Garfunkel had it right in their classic song:  Sounds of Silence many years ago.,?
1956,What kind of person gives away something they borrowed. Self entitled egoists  that's who.   Your friend is a jerk and Atwood was rude to "ask for the hat". You  on the other hand  are  just looking for your 15 min on the coattails of another author.,?
1957,Exactly Malumba - when will Trump produce his evidence???    Trump can't make claims like this and not show any evidence.,?
1958,600 years since a Pope has resigned  and Benedict - who is no fan of change in the Church - resigns  with mental capacity intact  and we're supposed to believe it's just another day in the Vatican?  And then both he and the new Pope talk about a "gay mafia " and we're supposed to ignore that?  You don't need to be a conspiracy theorist to connect the dots.,?
1959,So she is Canadian living in Beijing and practising their religion. Now all of a sudden it's the Canadian governments fault? Has she ever lived here?,?
1960,Regarding your final paragraph:- My understanding is that the Mass translation did indeed go through a process of 'consultation' - but that most of the opinion and advice which was given  was in fact ignored; the poor translation was pushed through regardless. Like Governments and Businesses  Churches often promise 'consultation' processes. But they rarely pay attention to the results.,?
1961,Another white hipster caught stealing. Haha!  He was probably throwing a party for someone. Got the meat and now for the present.,?
1962,"What now"?  Simple  Alaska is in a recession of which will get worse despite any actions Trump may take.  Jobs will be seriously decimated by dumping this volume of permits into an allready declining economy and oil will not return to the anomalous highs we had for nearly 1/2 a decade.  Get ready for the boom and bust mining town cycle of cabs soon to come.  This was a bad decision which will lead to disary in the cab service and ultimately destroy a great number of Alaskan jobs while denying service availibty in the end.  This is NOT the time for making such drastic changes to transportation regulation.  This is beyond being described as bad decision making.,?
1963,I heard the ghost of Timothy McVeigh and Lea Harvey Oswald are headed to DC. Glad I don't live there.,?
1964,I was told by a driver today that the fare would be $2 on October 1 for senior and the disabled.  No mention was made of single-ride fares or passes for that matter.  BTW  I'm disabled but have never heard of an ADA identification card.,?
1965,Maybe I missed it  but did Kim Jong Orange try that stupid  juvenile "handshake" of his with Vlad?,?
1966,Great work getting more scum off the streets.,?
1967,Fascism today is a far left thing... Thugs...,?
1968,Yes  he would have said anything. Why  he might have even falsely admitted guilt.,?
1969,Where were you when your four and six-year-old daughters were being raped over a two-week period?,?
1970,"Anyone who thinks that sitting in a church will make you a christian  must also think that sitting in a garage can make you a car" Walk the walk or shut up; the only thing stinkier than a thief is a proud hypocrite.,?
1971,Stay out of Canada TRUMP!  You and your whole family are a joke and embarrassment!,?
1972,Most are not even of the horse barn,?
1973,Translation: Lie your asses off. Make shit up.,?
1974,Not true.   Not a single prisoner in the Arizona Tent City died for lack of health care or nutrition.,?
1975,Justice. For. Leroy.,?
1976,& they all SUCK!!!!!!,?
1977,They wanted dope.,?
1978,Work with the legislature? The legislature that has stuck its fingers in its ears and sung  la la la la for the last two years? Sorry  the lack of leadership is in the Republican majority. They have stonewalled every attempt to get them to deal with our fiscal problems.,?
1979,I'm glad to see this project well underway  with about one third of the funding already taken care of. It has significance for me  as I attended kindergarten  as did so many others  in the room behind the lower windows that you see on the left in the photo. When I was a bit older  I recall seeing Governor Mark Hatfield speak there at a Memorial Day observance. We had a parade as well that day I think.  I always thought it was a special building each time I passed. It used to have a silver painted artillery shell on each side of the entry steps  which appealed to many young boys in our "BattleBoy" years. I hope they restore those. But it is not far from being 100 years old and its age and deferred maintenance are apparent. Fixing it up will add to the old time atmosphere and heritage of downtown Cottage Grove as well as provide a nice venue for community activities.  http://www.cottagegrove.org/community/page/armory https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51dljcS_r7Y,?
1980,Annie  did you know that in certain parts of India it is considered a great insult to ask someone you are meeting for the first time where they are from? The reason being that such a question immediately introduces prejudice and pigeon holes a person. They prefer to ask 'where are you going?'  The Church could learn from such wisdom. It would s absolutely consumed by the past.,?
1981,Sessions hates marijuana even more than he hates African Americans. He jokingly told someone years ago that he "thought the KKK was OK until he found out they smoked pot."  More disturbing garbage from the worst administration in our country's history.,?
1982,Interestingly enough  the budget also proposes rescinding the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act  which gives those states 35% revenue sharing (offshore).,?
1983,I think he needs spelling lessons as well.,?
1984,people at trumps rallys fill the stadiums  Clinton....crickets. she lied herself into a lost election. liar  liar  nasty pantsuit on fire.,?
1985,The crowd would go absolutely nutso bonkers frothing at the mouth rabid crazy!!!,?
1986,No use  too many devout Jack-A$$es in this state will still vote in stupid as stupid will stare right into their face and offer them a free lunch plate to vote (D)onkey!,?
1987,DEFLECTION ALERT   wow you lib trolls never live in the story   well when your party is nothing but crooks and incompetence i guess you have nothing to stand on,?
1988,Haberdashery?,?
1989,Don't be so silly Kon man  what you wrote is here for all to see:  "And yet he handily defeated incumbent Begich." "And he easily defeated a lifelong Alaskan  incumbent Senator Begich  hmm........."  For you to deny writing that is noting but a poor attempt to change the subject  after you lost the  argument. Get over it.,?
1990,Demonstrates again that the Trump campaign is not ready for prime time.  I know it's fun to stoke conspiracy theories  but somehow the people who are "incompetent" and "losers" (i.e. the Clinton campaign) figured it out.  We are seeing time and time again that the Republicans managed to blow a great opportunity to mount a winning campaign when they nominated Trump.  Instead  they got a whining campaign.,?
1991,Who has time for this crap.  GET A JOB!  LONG LIVE TRUMP!!!!!,?
1992,Absolute rubbish. http://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=727&t=6,?
1993,If your only reference to historical events are those depicted by Disney and Hollywood in general then many were probably confused that the characters weren't sparkly clean  with perfect teeth and hair. The reality of course was quite different  but in revisionist history even the clothes and appearance aren't safe.,?
1994,The Senate should keep Senator Tokuda in her position.  She's done a great job  looking after all of us.  I wish she were our State Senator.  We'd definitely vote for her.,?
1995,Be careful when drinking the Kool Aid...many fools like you have lost because of it.,?
1996,Mr. Brooks.   Grassroots....always the beginning of a cause that needs to be taken seriously.  This March all began from just 2 people....Mother and Daughter....and what say you?,?
1997,Sending Sludge to China will not run them  you have to be the biggest idiots on this whole planet/,?
1998,So you will drive more then 100 k from your recharge station.  Don't dumb as in dead dummy.,?
1999,You support Trump...an avowed racist. Why?,?
2000,"...cement his autocratic rule over the country and  in the view of many experts  erode Turkey's democratic institutions."  Anyone surprised that Trump backs this guy?,?
2001,I don't think he has a clue what NAFTA is.,?
2002,As long as Trump throws gay people under the bus and promises churches they can do whatever they want? No  Utahns don't.,?
2003,Do you tell whites to stop killing other whites?  Because that's who kills white folks.  If not  why not?,?
2004,Michael Bennet supports Antifa  which is on the DHS terror watch list.,?
2005,your boy trumpet is so obnoxious as to defy understanding,?
2006,It's not up to the opposition parties to investigate these events  they hold their own anyway.,?
2007,NO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CHARGE ? TOTAL GARBAGE! THIS SCUM HAS BEEN BREEZED THROUGH AGAIN,?
2008,Coderre was a senior minister in the Chretien Government during the sponsorship scandal.   Do I need to say more.,?
2009,You claiming it's racist  now that is racist,?
2010,Or  maybe they are thinking that it's great that their grandkids can read and write (because  when they were kids during Bastista's days  they couldn't).  Or  maybe they're just thankful that Auntie Rosalita got her hip replacement.  She would have died before Castro took over.    Stuff like that.,?
2011,incompetent crooks.,?
2012,Completely disagree with you  Lana.  No one can be "censored" unless they allow it. Further  if she "neutered" either of these two people  it was with exact legal proof of her position (whatever subject you're talking about here; don't know).  She is one of the most brilliant minds in Hawai'i.  Moku o Keawe needs leadership  and what has Bo Kahui done besides his La'i Opua (which Mililani helped him achieve  btw)? Mililani Trask's record and accomplishments in her continued fight for our lahui for over (40 years!) defies superlatives. There is no way Bo Kahui can be as effective as Mililani Trask as an OHA Trustee.  Need to huli OHA  and she has the knowledge  experience  and substance to do it.  Frankly  we need to get all the sitting Trustees out!,?
2013,Now there is a pair of mugshots!  https://oregoncrimenews.com/cottage-grove-woman-arrested-after-leading-police-on-chase-through-eugene-springfield-which-culminated-in-3-car-crash-at-busy-intersection/  "No fool like an old fool!" comes to mind!,?
2014,Butts was the architect of the energy clown show in Ontario and Wynne has pushed forward with the same policies of waste  incompetence  and insider deals. Now Butts is Trudeau's right hand man and he has his sights on sewering the rest of Canada with the same smug short-sighted stupidity. McGuinty  Wynne  Butts  they couldn't care less with $200K/year pensions coming their way  the "green" energy disaster is hurting the poorest in Ontario while punishing job creators. The Ontario liberals are a national disgrace and Trudeau is about to double down on the same policies based on shameless self-righteous ignorance of a naive idealist with an unearned sense of entitlement to taxpayers wallets.,?
2015,He has WAY better judgement than crooked Hillary,?
2016,Where's Ken Jacobus when you need him. I always liked reading about him taking on the gvmt.,?
2017,Jive.  I had 185 gallons of water onboard my Morgan 44.  World Series earthquake. The advertiser continues to promote stupidity.,?
2018,Everyone stops to watch a train wreck.,?
2019,Boy  Joe Dick  are you ever ignorant. If you'd known any history of Canada's progressive left  you know that most of their leaders were ordained ministers or rabbis. Far from trying to shut down religious practice  they tried to bring religious practice into government. Where do you think the idea of universal healthcare comes from? Or welfare? Unemployment insurance? Old Age pensions? Even universal education comes from religious people and not from secular capitalists.  Your ignorance seems to know no bounds. It's leftwing progressives who are calling for accommodation. Don't be obtuse. And it's the rabid Right who are calling for their banishment.  You need to learn a little history before you comment again.,?
2020,My thoughts exactly. I don't want his garbage comments coming to me at all times of the day and night.,?
2021,Good.  The NRA and tRump deserve each other.  Blam  blam  blam.  Shoot 'em up  bang 'em up.,?
2022,Trump either thinks he is untouchable as president or is dumb as a bag of rocks.,?
2023,I'm neither a dermatologist nor a pitcher. But there are clear differences between an oarsman and a pitcher. I don't think a callous is any better than a blister. A pitcher needs 'feel' or 'touch' on the ball to generate the spin necessary to move a ball around the strike zone. Without movement  he's dead (for evidence  look at Marco Estrada's recent resumé). A callous will likely be less painful  but the issue with Sanchez's blister isn't pain - it's touch. An oarsman (correct me here if I'm wrong) doesn't need touch. There's nothing delicate nor pinpoint about repeatedly reaching forward and pulling back. That's no slight to rowing which has great athletes. But callouses  especially on finger tips  are likely no help to a big league pitcher.,?
2024,Everything about this is ridiculous.   Most kindly said  it is idiotic!   Ward Air should find a new CFO who has common sense  before he suggests cutting the budget for the company maintenance of their airplanes.,?
2025,"It would cause some revenue loss of to the illegals and the business that have grown to support them. "   They are not illegals. they are undocumented. Oh wait  wrong argument  wrong topic. sorry.,?
2026,Forget that.  Show me to the porn!,?
2027,For plain baffle gab  this is a contender. The suggestion of 'keeping  daylight savings time year- round' is a logical absurdity. In the centuries preceding the daylight savings idea  they weren't keeping daylight savings year- round  they just weren't doing it!  BTW: a lot of this stuff sounds like a cut and paste from Wiki that someone read me off their i-phone. Ya  we know that diminished daylight affects people. Saying that in 100 words instead of five is not hard.     So lets return to our sheep. It should be called 'daylight rationing.'  In Canada  in summer there is no need to ration daylight. In June the sun is up for hours while we're still in bed  and most of us are back at home when it gets dark towards ten.    But by November  there is not enough sunlight to have much more than 8 hours of it.  So who or rather  which part of the work day has priority?  If the clock didn't change little kids would be walking to school in pitch dark.  That's why the AM has priority,?
2028,Leftarded women are racist & misogynists as well especially when talking about conservative women. Hell Liberals are pretty racist and xenophobic them selves when dealing with anyone that has a different opinion than they do. Canada is the DNC's wet dream. no wonder there's so many pedophiles on Canadian soil.,?
2029,and then you woke up.  !!!   BMW - The brand of choice of egomaniacs  and "useful idiots".    Premium scrapola.,?
2030,And I'm tired of being libeled. People are tired of you two  as well.,?
2031,What? Dude  go eat your morning weed salad! LOL Last I recall  Obama was licking Putin's Boots! I sure didn't see Trump licking Putin's Boots when they met this year. Care to show how exactly the Russians rigged the election? Maybe you're going to tell us the Russians hacked the DieBold voting machines the entire Electoral College used and they all voted in favor for Trump? LOL,?
2032,Don't kid yourself GOPers.  Republicans will trample each other  to lick Trump's boots.  That green-eyed monster knows no bounds.,?
2033,I just want equal justice  CAELew.  While most of the things Green/HL attempted to steal are "priceless"  and there were hundreds of items  let just say conservatively they were worth  oh  $500 million.  If Green/Hobby paid a $3 million fine  that would be  what  six tenths of one percent fine based on the value stolen.  So  someone who steal $120 worth of things from one of his stores should only pay 72 cents as a fine plus return what was stolen. (someone really should check my math).    Elagabalus raises the point of the problem of corporations as people when you cannot hold a corporation accountable in the same way an individual is held accountable.  Fine someone with hundreds of millions $3 million - such suffering!  Or fine a multibillion corporation billions of dollars - what do they care  it is a cost of doing business.  Notice those financial institutions who paid billions in fines are still in business?  The wealthy are the new "divine right" kings.  Money is power.,?
2034,Wow!  The left have been played  again.  Your desperation is making you weak and susceptible to Internet trolling.  Middle class America is watching the smug  elitist  hateful liberals make complete fools of themselves.    Denial  Anger  Bargaining  <--- you are here  Depression  Acceptance,?
2035,The utterly useless UN condemns something. They sit there in their Geneva based ivory tower sinecures pontificating their belly buttons achieving absolutely nothing. What a pathetic bunch of lazy good for nothing layabouts these people are.,?
2036,Oh Loretta Lynch got a good last name lynch mob. Free trips from D C lets see Sally the Jewel  Gina the Maggot McCarthy  Barrack Hussein Obama Kenya jigger. Obama wants new law you can not say Eskimo because it is slang word  on the news the other. What else can these 4 jerks screw up.,?
2037,So is Canada about killing someone that leaves Islam? Is Canada about muslims marching on AL QUDS day chanting to kill jews? Is Canada about Imams telling the mosque to go kill Jews? Is Canada about Imams telling new syrians to kill infidels? Is Canada about Female Genital mutilation ? Is Canada about muslim men defending their right to have sex with 9 yrs olds? Is Canada about honor killings? Is Canada about Sharia law. ?  Is Canada about Imams suggesting we all wear burqas so we don't get raped? Your comment suggests we should all accept this behaviour from muslims Be sheep. be ok with this ---Sharia-ism - like communism and Nazism - destroys the rights of all people.  .https://youtu.be/Lc6GVg3GfuI ps this is the video of the man defending his right to have sex with 9 yr old adults.,?
2038,Geeez  you're thick  Rhyner.  It's the CHILDREN and their accepting parents that were interviewed by Oprah.  You're afraid of what transgender children have to say about their own sexuality?  Haha,?
2039,You pretend to miss the OP's point don't you?,?
2040,Foolish non smokers thinking they can shape how its sold or consumed. Black market will flourish under the Ontario Liberal plan. Big Fail. Most consumers will continue to buy from Mom & Pop growers. Marijuana is not just a product but a Culture. Instead of making large amounts of taxes without any costs to the tax payer  I predict the Ontario government will lose money and fail in there approach to legalization. Voters should remember who signed off with this plan.,?
2041,If it were me  I wouldnt mind  but only if they were 20 something year old nurses who havn't gotten fat and ugly yet.... Pump it up with formeldahyde and take it for one last ride. =P,?
2042,Dear Bill and Byron  Its great that as lawyers you want to have this conversation with Alaska natives about their inherent rights that the corporate governess you lead has denied them.    Why don't you expand the conversation to all Alaskans that have had their individual rights denied under your corporate governess.  Alaskans are entitled to their individual sovereign rights that your federal franchise managers and the bar association have perverted.  Let me know when the STATE OF ALASKA is ready to offer real justice to the Alaska peoples.  Real respect of individual rights.   Not corporate rules  but the provisions of the Alaska Constitution.  When will the courts protect people rather than serve the interests of the bankers?,?
2043,The NDP claims that they will eliminate corporate and union funding from BC Politics.  Until that happens  they'll take contributions from anywhere they can  including a foreign union.  Hypocrites.,?
2044,Don't be such a hypocrite Bob.  You had faith in authority when Barack Hussein Obama and Eric Holder were running guns to the Mexican drug cartels.,?
2045,Its another failure of our education system.  Unfortunately  half the country does NOT understand or appreciate our free enterprise system-- which creates more Opportunity for All. They don't appreciate our sovereignty; or our Constitution. Instead  they're so ignorant  they want to copy every tiny socialist country  failed socialist countries etc.!  Its so pathetic to the point---they don't deserve to live in the U.S.,?
2046,Tina that is a poor excuse and he if he was grabbing pussies I doubt you were in the pool of choices.,?
2047,Your Mother’s Woodstock? ...Sad. Deplorable really. You can only hope this is the onset of senility rather than merely Liberal delusion. FYI there are so many who can’t bring themselves to pronounce Shrill-ary’s name either. Substituting “LIAR” is so much better.,?
2048,according to the survey that says "82% of black respondents support NFL players rights to kneel" - guess what? Guess what? This group of blacks is either - racist  anti-American  or just plain unintelligent enough to comprehend loyalty to our great country. Memo #1 to black folks - since you are such big proponents of democracy - YOU ARE THE MINORITY - which means that you don't get your way every time you whine and complain about BS racial oppression. Memo #2 to black folks: you are really pissing everybody else in America off with your racist aggression  violence against whites  asians  and hispanics  looting of tennis shoe stores during a natural disaster  burning up perfectly innocent businesses in your 'hoods. Memo #3 to black folks: GROW THE F---K UP,?
2049,A person of privilege & influence might serve everyone best by advocating for one candidate or another  but Meryl Streep viciously  inappropriately attacked Trump. She is one of the most talented  actresses  but her mean-spirited diatribe diminished her stature in my view. What was her purpose? She seemed like a street gang member screaming at someone from another gang. Disgusting.,?
2050,I thought your side thinks old white men are liars. Please stop being so erratic.,?

2052,anyone who sees 'wild steelhead' for sale or on any restaurant menu needs to inform those involved that this is not a sustainable resource and their involvement is going to lead to the extinction of this species.  the tribes know this but green backs are the one and only thing they think about.,?
2053,Excrement like Paul Manafort and Rick Gates just as a beginning. Trump will go down with all of his supporters.,?
2054,Ugly  combative  divisive  full of pseudo facts and distortions  probably the worst speech ever given by a US president.  yeaccchhh.,?
2055,Like his late dead daddy  JT must be anti-semitic.  He has remained silent to the Montreal guy who says we should punch Zionist Jews in the face.  If he promises to really do it  I would go to Montreal and he can punch me.  Guess I could punch him back.,?
2056,Obviously South Africans are incapable of such complex tasks. Best left to the lily white Russians.,?

2058,' No  the public isn't compelled to take on risk for private enterprise.  That's simply unAmerican. .,?
2059,The Clown is Bannon if he expects us to believe that the formaer head of the alt-right press isn't somewhat aligned with the fascists at Charlottesville. Also  he and Trump are nuts if they think they can fix the North Korea problem while simultaneously attacking the Chinese  the very people whose pressure is so sorely needed.,?
2060,Thanks. The article is about the Colorado Governor's race.....not his ethnicity  but the election to replace The HICK. Nobody can TOUCH Polis' $$$$$!,?
2061,Impeachment? Don't be daft. He's fulfilling his mandate.,?
2062,Health care is the economy stupid.,?
2063,Well the parents are stupid as hell.  They are responsible for this accident the same as if they kept bleach or rat poison on the laundry room floor.  Perhaps they should find a better place to store their loaded weapons other then in the toy box.   .,?

2068,Plainly ANSEP would be a good investor for Wrangell. With luck other educational organizations would build nearby or at the old pulp mill site. Its especially good for marine science  diving  learning beach landings  sailing and even carpentry if students were to build an old town like Skagway's for tourists to wander about.  I would think Wrangell City merchants would have satellite stores there. And finally someone could produce a Wrangell Dark Ale and microbrewing could be taught as well as marketing and business.   The area facilities are ripe for educational and commercial investment. The best site in S.E. Alaska in fact. Funny that it takes ANSEP to get it started.,?
2069,If your mentally ill presidential imposter were correct  then why did the generals and the military ignore his idiotic tweet?   Trumplethinskin will be shown the door  one way or another. You're in a small minority of Trump KKKoolaid drinkers who were conned and don't see it yet. But Republicans are waking up and realizing a mad man is in the Whitehouse.   Oh.. tRump's tweet you quote has been proved incorrect. Just another lie to distract his poorly educated voters from the reality of a failed (and most likely illegitimate) presidency.,?
2070,one crazy old lunatic doesn't make a war  most of those who voted for trump knew damn well that he's a bedbug; they won't be surprised when he's shitcanned,?

2075,The political honesty to say "not all Muslims are terrorists but all terrorists are Muslims?"  Yeah  I'd love to hear it too.,?
2076,I hope the G&M editors are not so stupid they think the cost of the wall is a determining factor in it being built or in the requirement that it be built.. I guess they don't really understand how Trump got elected and that he was elected on a platform.,?
2077,Bill Clinton was a transparent sexist pig. You can't argue with that.,?
2078,Dear MSW  President Obama has a message for you:  “Gov. Romney  I’m glad that you recognize that al Qaeda is a threat ” Obama said  “because a few months ago when you were asked what’s the biggest geopolitical threat facing America  you said Russia.”  “The 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because the Cold War’s been over for 20 years ” Obama said.,?
2079,You could live without a TV. TV is how we got here  dumb deplorable people sitting in front of the TV  watching an inane reality TV show about a rich businessman and thinking there was some reality in the TV.  Take a shelter dog for a walk  read a book  play a sport with your friends  take a hike in a national or state park  go to the bar and talk politics and religion over beer  visit the art museum. Life is better without an idiot box.,?
2080,Why in the world would you drink tap water anyway 😝,?
2081,As a lot of people are less and less aware of their surroundings when driving or parking in  they need more essential "Luxury" additions like automatic parking aids  sensors in all directions so they don't hit something around them  automatic brake sensors as they are not aware of vehicles in front of them slowing down rapidly  night time vision display as some are night blind and so on. One only wonders how so many people where able to drive without all this 2 decades ago safely and with sometimes less accidents then recently...,?
2082,A shot of Goo Aid for yout and poch. Nice work! Open Up!,?
2083,This person is still someone's son  and let's remember it's for driving violation!! Hes not out robbing people or stealing people's shit!  this person made a mistake because he was scared to go to jail  arnt most people? I agree that it was COMPLETLY dumb and irresponsible of him to do but again he was driving  thats it...what a peice of crap right...and as far as everything eles! There was some stuff that was exaggerated like when he was picked up anf arrested it said he made physical contact with the officer by pushing him out of the way and that is COMPLETLY made up!! He didint touch the officer untill he got tackled  and detained!!!,?
2084,The Republican clown car rolls on. The election of that orange buffoon has shown them the American people are far dumber then they could have ever believed  now for Governor Katie Perry  House member  Honey Boo Boo and President Willie Robertson.  America you deserve this  your ignorance and excess or criminal and it is fitting you suffer the fate of your own stupidity.,?
2085,A new guard - don't you mean a new idiot at large.  I trust the media far more than lying Trump. Nothing out of his twitter account or mouth can be trusted,?

2087,I hear crickets. It must be springtime in Ward 1.,?
2088,What is really garbage is your comments on Veterans. You aren't even worth my time to have a discussion with.,?
2089,"The irony is we tried to protect our forests from fire and we created a situation where they're much more susceptible and the fires are more damaging."  Let-her-burn!  Seriously  the U.S. Forest Service and most Canadian provinces have struggled with the fire management practice of trying to focus only on fighting fires that are directly endangering property and lives. However  this has continually been challenged by some groups  governments and forest industries  with some good reason.  Many fire fighting crew deaths (especially in the U.S.) have occured during attempts to  fight/control wildfires which posed no immediate danger to property or civilian lives!  To some every fire is a bad thing  to mother nature it is regeneration.,?
2090,How long is the red guard going to run this piece of trash,?
2091,The Left hate on Left White Women in race for the Georgian Governor's Race: "One of the main mantras of the chant was #trustblackwomen" http://www.opslens.com/2017/08/14/when-the-left-eats-its-own-white-female-gov-candidate-shouted-down-in-georgia/  I expect no less from your Racist Party! lol  BLM  Barry  Jesse  Al  Fredericka and Holy women Ms. Nadal and Ms. Brazille should be Proud of themselves. The New m.o. of the Democratic Party  anti-Whites! You got duped crafted by the Democratic Racist Tools,?
2092,The gun didn't choose to massacre a church full of Christians. A maggot chose to do that  whose mind was filled with hate  perhaps by swimming in a cultural sewer created by the left over the past several decades. The interesting angle  which you're ignoring  is that the leftwing media will ignore or severely downplay this creep's hatred of Christians. Now  if he had attacked a mosque  that would be an entirely different story  wouldn't it? Or if he had yelled "Allawah Akbar." C'mon  be honest.,?
2093,clearly you are one of the lunatic liberals  you cant refute or debate my notion that government is the problem thus proving you are the reject and stupid to boot!,?
2094,Isn't it fascinating to see this story wrongfully given such prominence in the news cycle even as the world and civilization itself metaphorically burns as these depraved acts of cultural   political  economic  and ecological arson are perpetuated by functional barbarians like Donald J Trump and the pathology and capital crimes of his Trumpist traitors to the US Constitution  the enemies of the Enlightenment  the expressions of contempt for reason  their departures from basic elemental sanity  their attacks and zealous extreme-and-regressive ideological undermining of progress  and their odious loathing of basic integrity and human decency itself. Let's triage the news and talk about what actually matters. Let's talk about these illegitimate monsters and their wrongful occupation and subversion of not just our liberal democracy  but the entire system of civilization for the West. They are not just the enemies of America  they are the enemies of mankind and their reign terror must end.,?
2095,Stupid beyond Believe!!,?
2096,The division we play in is weak so the real test comes in the playoffs.  We all miss Dave S. who is far the betetr coach.,?
2097,I didn't vote for Mr. Trump.  Like it or not  he IS our president.  One thing his election made abundantly clear:  How rabid Progressives and the agenda-driven media have become.   For example: Only 3 percent of reports about President Trump airing on NBC and CBS nightly news were positive (nonpartisan press research firm Media Tenor). This article is another example.  Global travel "politicized"? As if it never was before?  Trump caused another "stir" in a long line of "stirs".  Only difference here:  How another  sudden  "politicized" non-story regurgitates itself  ad nauseam  from a hostile corporate-owned press.    A huge segment American government leadership doesn't want better relations with Russia. Ask yourself why?  Russia never attacked the U.S.  Same goes for China  Iraq  Iran.  Look at US-Iranian history. We started their nuclear program...and how many countries have WE bombed?  An American "deep state" exists and its interests diverge from those of the citizenry.,?
2098,Fake new got the entire election wrong and Trump won. Perhaps the left wing media should stop  in-breading  shut up and listen to the people for a while!   It's at a point that big media has positioned  itself as opposition.   Truly is anybody surprised their credibility is one lower than a cockroach.,?
2099,Newman  when you say "they can fix it"  by "they" I hope you meant the government not CRA.,?
2100,Showing your age there.,?
2101,there is very much a thing called stupidity and you live in it sins   clearly one of the ALT LEFT WINGERS here...,?
2102,I only want to pay for having the budget fixed. Don't waste time on other items that truly can wait another year! It is going to be hard  but must be done. Cut to right-size the government. That's not easy...can Alaska truly support three 4-year universities? I hate to say  probably not. Choose one to be the 4-year school and let the others provide AA's. That is a hard choice. There are others that will cut the budget. Once it's right-sized  then look at using the earnings reserve of the Permanent Fund. Then look at broad-based taxes. I personally like sales tax. That allows visitors to Alaska to help maintain our infrastructure.,?
2103,We need to start killing anyone bringing illegal hard drugs into the United States  they are killing the youth of America  they are terrorist and deserve DEATH. They are DISTROYING our country and they are not American citizens  I say kill them for murdering our children and family's.,?
2104,Typical Liberal response:  "Conservatives are too dumb to bother debating."  If the only response that is ever given is "the debate is settled"  then why should we ever bother trying to debate?,?
2105,Legislators are worthless as tits on a boat hog!,?
2106,I'm absolutely certain that it wasn't the leaders out there pounding on police cars. However  trump invited a pedophile maniac  ted nugent  to the White House. What's your point?,?
2107,It would be a real problem if all were D's.  And the D's need to heed the agony of the GOP as one day it will be their turn.  The pendulum swings.  In the balanced world neither D's nor R's have a lock on governing  there is the best practices and policies taken from each side of the philosophy spectrum.  The D's don't have much of a bench these days; it they did Hillary would  be getting a far tougher fight than is playing out.  If  for example  Sam Nunn were to be in the race Hillary and Bernie would likely be fighting it out for the bottom or Vice.,?
2108,"foreign leaders who believe sanctions should only be eased if Moscow complies with the West’s conditions"  LOL!  There are very few who believe that independently of pressure from the Obama administration.,?
2109,Your party started spouting hate and division decades ago.  Now you say "let's all get along".  Hypocritical crap.  Guess what  you reap what you sow.,?
2110,Of course. you're right.  It's definitely a civil right issue.  Republicans want to deny rights to groups they find icky.  It's the idiotic icky test for bigots.,?
2111,When the market is hot and prices are climbing  as they have been for a few years now  people want to get in on the action and make some money so everyone has been buying up all the homes...that is why the inventory is low. Now we have reached the peak of the mountain and we are going down the other side...prices are falling. As it continues  people will start to lose money on the homes they have bought and panic will start to set in. With each passing month more money will be lost on their home so they will want to sell before they lose too much. As the homes start to sell  the inventory will grow.,?
2112,Also  I think we need a premium reduction  never mind  just holding the current rates.,?
2113,The American military-industrial complex will kill anyone  any time  to put an emphasis on their ideology. They have dropped bombs on children before and they will do it again. A human life is a human life. It doesn't matter about age  race  or gender.,?

2116,alt left wing losers cant resist   the oil companies have contributed billions and billions to our wealth   economy ans social causes!  the idea that the sky has not falled on our environment there is something ignorant left wingers need to understand for once.. but heck its the globe and they cant let a single edition going without letting brain washed sheep like you spewing your ignorance,?
2117,Your "If either the buyer or the seller does not want to enter into that contract for whatever reason then I believe they have the right to refuse." means that you support those who say "no Dogs of Jews" or "Whites Only" and similar expressions of bigotry. You demonstrate out of your own mouth your wholehearted support of racism  sexism  antisemitism and all other forms of bigotry. As I said previously  your claim of being a Christian is a complete and utter sham.,?
2118,Obama sold Washington to Wall Street.,?
2119,Oh  I agree - I voted too - I used parliamentarian rules and voted my truth. Here's the kicker - it's not going to make a whit of difference until the people wake up to what's really going on with our political elites.  Bored with Clinton is denial to who they are - there's nothing boring about them - why they just eliminated another 3 people in the last month willing to testify about them... Gee... now I'm bored.,?
2120,Ummm...Hello???  McFly??? Anyone home???  What is conveniently missing is the context in which the president made that statement.  Obviously he was being facetious in this instance if one were to watch the video clip when he said that.  But  of course it is all the libtard left can do  is to keep spinning and spinning and spinning.    Even the idiot Shumer speaks without knowing all the facts.  Again  nothing knew.  Libtards rely on emotion and factless information.,?

2126,Bill  I believe Clinton has a 100% rating from both PP and NARAL. Nothing else can be inferred from that. We have sex ed out the wazoo at our government schools. Folks cannot claim ignorance  but they will claim convenience in order to justify aborting a life.  We on the Conservative spectrum don't believe government has most of the answers. In fact  we believe they have very few. Yes  it is necessary to help those who CAN"T help themselves  but not those who WON"T help themselves. All the things you enumerate are not the purview of our Federal Government. It's not a checkered record - It's a different way how we expect people to act to do as much for themselves as possible and not depending on a crutch from BIG GOV"T.,?

2129,It's also an industry town that doesn't have the tourism or eco friendly aspects of Cordova  Seward  Homer or many other small Alaskan towns on the coast. Why screw up yet another swathe of the state by running a dangerous gas pipeline through Denali National Park and under Cook Inlet?

2134,Hmmmm...really?  Did the article state that statistic (although I'll readily admit that I don't know what a CDOR or an OJW is)?  I just find it statistically unbelievable that there were only 57 charges since 2013...given that there were 8 700 denials in one year.,?
2135,Mortgage qualification standards in Canada have always been high.  The government dealt with the potential for higher risk CMHC borrowers to default in a correction by submitting these buyers to a stress test a year ago.  Demanding a stress test for all buyers is overkill.,?
2136,Yes  Trump is just a big cry baby.................. many spoiled rich children are.  He just hasn't matured much in the past 70 years,?
2137,Trump makes a historic visit to Saudi Arabia and what does the FakeNews .com cover?  Melania's hair!  Good job SA for publishing trash.  Trashy paper  but appropriate for a Dem Party newsletter.  Look at all the BoZos just eating it up like scavengers. It would be sad if it wasn't so funny.,?

2139,Since we live in the "boonies"  halfway between Vancouver and Calgary  it is Canada Post that delivers our Amazon orders. Which means we can track the parcels online. If the starting point is back East it can take one week — since we always order past the C$ 35 point and choose free shipping.  Lately we noticed that a lot of items originate out of Richmond BC  get here in two days i.e. way earlier than the projected arrival. But you're right  try that with a letter and it will be a joke. BTW when Margaret grumbles about the "features" back East (weather  congestion etc. etc.) I send her an email signing off with "Living in the beautiful Okanagan Valley"  she doesn't really appreciate that. That's quite understandable  I spent my first thirty years in Canada with home bases in Southern Ontario. LOL,?

2142,It's pretty easy Bill Hooper. When he says  and I quote direct from the Don's lips "There are many fine people on both sides". He has clearly taken the stance that marchers for White Supremacy and the KKK have fine people. That makes him a pathetic racist.,?

2146,Of course these people are mad!  They've been told for almost thirty years  by idiots like Rush Limbaugh  Sean Hannity and Fox News  et. al.  that the courts are illegitimate (Liberal activist judges!! Liberal activist judges!!)  the elections are illegitimate (Election fraud  election fraud!!!)  that the media is out to get them (Liberal media!!! Liberal media!!) and that half of America hates America (Democrats are islamunazisocialists!!!). All the while the Republican Party stood by in tacit approval of the de-legitimization of institutions vital to democracy in hopes of garnering a few extra votes from the Palin-American contingent.   And here we are. Was it worth it  Republican Party? The monster you've created is now out of control and threatening to bring us all down. Palin-Americans are now supremely paranoid and feeling backed into a corner like wild animals. And you never know what a wild animal will do when backed into a corner. Good luck turning it off  jerks.,?
2147,I really wonder about an economic system that depends on "investors" who were stupid enough to not foresee the shambles that is the Trump administration. I assumed that the Trump Bump in the stock market after the election was due to wealthy people anticipating massive tax cuts under Trump - an expectation that was reasonable  even if it amounted to atrocious public policy and a guarantee of long-term failure. But if these people actually believed - contrary to the overwhelming evidence - that Trump was going to be a competent President then they are idiots. That should frighten everyone.,?

2149,Madonna  Kathy Griffin  and now this Depp are just marginally-talented (at best) entertainers who make these kinds of stupid statements for the publicity.  And it works.,?
2150,But this issue should have been addressed  resolved a long time ago  especially when lay people started to replace clerics and nuns  religious at these institutions. Why  did lay people wait so long? Why didn't they discuss better contacts (that included better pension benefits) when they first applied for the job -- with a view to reaching an agreement? Why work -- at the outset  on day one -- for any institution (with exemptions) that abrogates all laws and responsibilities that safeguard providing adequate and fair pension benefits to its employees? Indeed  in this case  the study of the abnormal is the best way to understand the normal. The abnormal in this job application scenario thought of one thing exclusively -- getting a job  without thinking of retirement benefits  pensions. Talk about exploiting silence in the hiring process!! I hope the Court resolves it for their sakes who (naively  stupidly  innocently?) only half knew what they were getting into.,?

2154,If increasing turnout requires increasing the number of ignorant or apathetic voters - or both- I prefer not to increase turnout.,?
2155,I agree with your idea. We should spread out the low income housing so they are not all bunched up together. We should put up a few projects in Kahala. It will be good for the low income people to be sourrounded by higher standards so they can strive to achieve the same.  Put a few low income housing projects in Kailua. With all of the exposure to tourists  maybe they can develop some new services.  Turtle Bay has a lot of space. we can probably fit 2 large units up there  one on each side of the compound.  And KoOlina and Kapolei  a few large low income housing places out there.  You are correct. Low income people need to be surrounded with more high income earners so they can have good examples in life.,?

2157,Truthfully  if his value goes to the 300-400 million dollar value  there is no way this team should ever approach that figure. Only a select few can do that deal with the Dodgers probably getting it done as Nolan can play at home.   This team will be competitive for the next few years while Arenado and the young pitching window is open...whether they make a world series is based on how well put together the others teams are and how they gel. I would have sworn the Mets were setup for a multi year World Series run like the Giants were based on their top tier pitching...who knew they were all made of paper and none could stay healthy...a certain amount of it is luck no matter how much you spend(aka Dodgers).,?
2158,UAA isn't Stanford.  But maybe if we shut down the sports programs we wouldn't have these jock problems.,?

2160,Another Obama level plant has been called on the carpet and fired by President Trump!! The Obama administration Drug Czar  Michael P. Botticelli in place since March 2014 has stood still and lined his pockets with taxpayer monies while the opioid and heroin situation has moved from a local to a national crisis under his watch. His inaction alone is indicative to gutting this office and starting from scratch. How can Governor Christie do any worse?  Last week President Trump called the Obama level Surgeon General Vitek H. Murthy to the White House and fired him. He is to be replaced by rear admiral Sylvia Trent-Adams an outstanding nursing graduate of Hampton University. These two positions headed up by Governor Christie and admiral Trent-Adams coupled with the New VA Chief are uniquely in place to fight this drug that has festered under Obama who has himself questionable drug episodes in his life...  President Trump is draining the swamp one person at a time.... Outstanding....,?

In fact  their recent correspondence specifically asks HART to provide an alternative that stops the elevated heavy rail at Middle Street and provides other avenues for connecting to later stops. Although the agreement may reference the ability of FTA to require reimbursement  no one is able to point to any examples where the FTA successfully recouped the full amount granted for a transit project.

2165,The problem of course is mental health treatment actually makes people psychotic and prevents their recovery  scientifically speaking  and furthermore it has no effect on mind control victims like Esteban Santiago. The United States has a big problem with torturing  mind controlling  dosing citizens with radiation  and mental illness inducing drugs- over 1 million victims of government mind control to date all denied justice: www.estebansantiago.us has details on today's mind control program. Details on the farce mental health treatment system on the site too.  Got to learn to focus on the problem: stopping government from remotely interrogating and putting voices in peoples heads. Got to focus on the other issue of poverty  crap school system across the board  lack of housing  lack of ability to self enrich and live in peace without enslavement to capitalism and forced employment.,?

2183,The market won't react as quickly as it did during the most recent housing bubble burst because rental properties have been accumulated by fewer parties.  I think it was just yesterday the paper ran a story about a single company now owning 82 000 single family rental homes.  This kind of consolidation will allow these entities to maintain artificially elevated rental prices due to their sheer size  insulating their investment at the renters cost.,?

2193,foolish politicians. I would be surprised if changes arise. They will just bull this through. They have the support of unions (against the 'rich' ie middle class mostly). To give these changes credibility they have to start increasing taxes against the truly rich (themselves). No more family trusts  start with inheritance taxes so the ultra rich get to pay their 'fair share'.  Increase taxes on the pensions of civil servants and no 'fee splitting' of these pensions anymore (this has been excused from the new changes!!). Notice how quiet Morneau and Trudeau have been about changes to family trusts? Their arrogance is sensational. Very   very disappointing duo.,?

2201,However Trump cannot fire the FBI director because he was continuing to investigate Trump and staff members and any illegal collusion with Russian officials.  Flynn was already caught lying about his Russian ties.  If a case can be made  with Comey's testimony  that Trump fired Comey to end/stifle the Trump / Russian investigation  that is an impeachable offense.  Presidents of the US are given incredible power  however like Nixon  the line is drawn when they act like scheming dictators.,?

2206,THEROCK17  you're not calling Trump on his shell game. He will make a few protectionist moves and grandstand about them while cutting ENORMOUS amounts of taxes on the wealthy  gutting healthcare for the lower classes if he can  and doing nothing really to help the income gap (including leaving free trade as is).  Trump is part of an uber-rich elite that runs the world  dude  and he has sold product made by people making only cents on the hour. Not sure how you can buy Trump as champion of the little guy. That's just a line. That champion's name is Bernie Sanders  a man with a life-time of work dedicated to the underdog. Trump will not stymy free trade. He knows it benefits the rich enormously. Watch  NAFTA won't go anywhere. You're on a side that's tricking you.,?

2210,Our Congress sucks. Term limits are a necessity  if we hope to save our nation from the constant ineptitude of our "public servants" who only serve themselves. Do us a favor and retire.

Good people who have just fallen on hard times and then you have this s puka who lies to make himself feel better.,?
2214,This is the stupidest thing ever. When we can't afford to spend more money these people spend more. If they want to go to their office  fly to Juneau as they already have offices there. We also need to make a limit as to the number of times they fly back and forth to Juneau. This crap of flying home on weekends has to stop. If you don't like it don't run for office.,?

2217,"There is no “blank page” to stare you down; there is a series of notes to follow. An outline is a far more powerful motivator than a timer."  Established authors do a disservice to beginners when they tell them they must outline.  I never could.  If I'd believed what Mr Smith says  I might have quit before I really got started.  I start with a character in his/her normal situation then create an event that propels that character into a conflict.  Then I see how it works out.  I'm often halfway or even two-thirds the way through a novel before I know how it's going to end.  And it doesn't take me a year to write one.  At a thousand words a day  working most days  I can produce a novel in four months -- and that includes revisions and polishing.  I've sold nineteen novels  to publishers large and small  and ghosted three more for other people  to be published under their names.  I'm not rich and famous  but George R.R. Martin did call one of my books "a tremendous amount of fun.",?
2218,“I expect the new President to work with leadership in Congress and political parties to engage in the promise for the people  of the people and by the people. That would be all people  not just some.”  Two thoughts from Abraham Lincoln come to mind here:   Abe said  “Government of the people  by the people and for the people shall not perish from the Earth.”   Well  under Obama it disappeared for a while. For the last eight years  we’ve had a people of the government  for the government and by the government.   Abe also said  “You can fool all of the people some of the time and some of the people all of the time  but you can’t fool all the people all of the time.”   Those who can be fooled vote for Democrats.,?

I Pine-Sol for the days when it was safe to use the restrooms without fear on the nefarious fecal. . The state should enlist the Protectors to commence Potty Patrols forthwith.  The empowerment of Potty Protectors is our only defense against restroom desecration.,?
2226,Hey you still can't get over the fact that Hillary lost. You and all the other posters who though they knew something. Just admit it you were wrong.,?
2227,your post just plain stupid as usual!,?
2228,Their attempts to control the 'news' worked so poorly and as a result the polls and the talking heads all were blindsided by what actually happened they are struggling to regain some kind of relevance.  If Trump keeps on Tweeting they are going to be so outraged!,?
2229,Yes 300 millions Americans with a gun culture and your failed ilk think putting people in prison will help. The irony is Chicago with the strongest gun laws in America has a horrific record of violence and incarceration of blacks.  Perhaps if the ragging left in  Hollywood would stop exploiting family values   sex and  gun violence in 3/4 of it movies America could start to heal.  But nope  you and your ilk start waving the left wing flag. What a joke !,?
2230,Isn't it disgusting? These people commenting  and the Liberals clearly don't know how to use a dictionary. None of this makes any sense. Everyone wants to protect the religion of Islam  and they care nothing about the muslims. That's exactly what I see here.,?
2231,You mean like China? They are kicking America's ass in technology. What they don't have they copy or steal. And you buy it to complain about Canada.,?
2232,I have regard for everyone  even so-called angry bums  but my regard also extends to people who don't want to be afraid on the streets of our city. The people you refer to as bums have a right to exist and as far as I'm concerned they may go wherever they like  but they must not be allowed to infringe on others' rights to peacefully travel where they will. As a society  we seem to have lost our regard for the rights of common citizens.,?

2240,Not so fast my friend.  Depends on the type of battery used for solar use.  Most batteries used are still of the lead acid flood type where water is added occasionally.  Like when charging a car's lead acid battery  proper ventilation is advised.  Then you have sealed gel batteries with an internal absorbing material for gasses.  In any case  as long as you're using lead acid type batteries  you have to be careful. You're not dealing with flashlight or small lithium batteries you use for laptops or toothbrush use. Google for different types and capacities.,?
2241,So what do you do to make a living? The profit motive is what provides jobs  feeds families  and provides the extras in life that we all desire. Greed motive is a lot different than the profit motive. I'm sure when you sell your home  if you own your own home  you won't be worried about profit at all. You are just going to donate it to the city so they can put some of our homeless people in it. After all  the profit motive corrupts everything right?,?
2242,Dr.  Thank you  that was interesting. Of course I know you're aware that antibiotics were discovered by accident. Mold was used in ancient times to fight infections. Dr. Fleming was looking for something else when he discovered the effects of mold had  on bacteria. But without a strong   immune system any treatment by modern medicine will be palliative at best.  Our own bodies are nearly miraculous at  fighting infections and  healing.  Yes  a doctor can 'set' a broken bone  but he can't make it grow together again.,?

2244,If we are to learn history from a television program  can we also learn philosophy by attending church  or economics by listening to the CBC?   I think we should return to the old rule: If you're young  stupid or ill-educated  shut up and listen to the wise. You may learn something.,?
2245,I have never seen anything more evil in my life. This judge with a badge has made the decision to ruin innocent lives. Worse yet  this idiot actually thinks he is doing good. I've been in the Marine Corps for 24 years and we pride ourselves on professionalism. This is not professional  it is pure evil.

2248,We can no longer afford our  "go-along-to-get-along" legislative body steeped in secrecy  awash in revenues  and seemingly more dedicated to being in power and drawing a check for life than in resolving state issues. Of course they should be fairly compensated; however  that compensation must be linked to productivity.     If they are not going to restrict the number of bills and resolutions allowed per legislator or require a minimum number of co-sponsors then they must deal with all the legislation before them and resolve each piece of legislation by passage  defeat  formal combination with similar legislation or withdrawal by the primary sponsor.  Perhaps each bill or resolution introduced should represent a fraction of their compensation and if that legislation is not resolved as stated above  then their pay will be reduced accordingly.  If they don't want to do the job then they should find another line of work.,?

That is the thing I love about republicans  they go from one extreme  to the other  lol,?
2272,Interesting comment with no knowledge. The dividend is our (the people's) mineral rights. If you own property  you don't own the minerals on it. That's what the dividend is in a nutshell. They don't want to give us what's ours  they need to give up OUR rights. The dividend is not simply a handout  it is rightfully ours.,?

2277,Can somebody explain to me why a piddling little raise in interest rates sows so much panic in the economy? Most of the national corporations operate  on hefty mark ups  so why would an extra one or two percent in the cost of borrowing hurt them that much. Back  in the 1980's the interest rate got close to  20% and they still managed to churn stuff out. I was recently on a trip to China where a shoe manufacturer told me that he only gets paid around $15 by western importers  for a pair of shoes ( and that includes his shipping) Then those same shoes are in the stores for anywhere between $125- and $250   ... more for dress shoes. He does this and still manages to keep his factory running  and pay his staff.  Even when  retailers put their goods on sale at 50% off  they're making fabulous money and the same story must be extrapolated to other industries. So why can't they absorb an increase of a percentage or two without throwing themselves out of  their corporate hi-rise windows?,?
2278,If I work 60 hours a week for 40 years  it's only possible because my stay at home wife makes it so. Because we chose to do that  rather than hire nannies / pay for childcare etc (not that there is anything wrong if you want to do that)  why can I not income share with her? These measures are a serious slap in the face to stay at home parents  and it deeply devalues their work.,?
2279,Yes  it is always true that anything could happen. But I doubt much will happen. One of the few statements by Fr.

2292,Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper on Wednesday said that President Donald Trump’s cavalcade of scandals surrounding the investigation into whether members of his campaign colluded with Russian officials has put the Watergate scandal to shame.,?
2293,The German unions never posed problems of the kind seen in France  even during the "Hartz 4" reforms of welfare and labour laws that you allude to.  The prevailing culture of consensus causes the cost of labour to rise more slowly in Germany than in other Euro zone countries  which undermines the competitiveness of the latter. The logical way out is for France to leave the Euro. Macron is committed to the Euro  which means that his presidency will simply be another five lost years.,?
2294,Dodgers suck. Baseball is always about who has the best tv deal so they can outbid everyone for players.  That's why it's relegated to a parochial position as far as national interest.

2300,The bomber wasn't a soldier of isis  he was just another islamic coward,?
2301,Donald J. Trump is proving he's little more than a naive idiot and a schoolyard bully. Contrast Japan with China:. Shinzo Abe arrived a couple of days after the election to kiss the ring of the capitalist imperial emperor. Xi Jinping won't be bowing to Trump. We can be certain that China will call his bluff. The US is headed for significant inflation within the context of tariff loving protectionism. Do we really need to listen to this mouthpiece for the next four years? The only real consolation is it's certain he's destined to be a lame duck president. No US president has been this brash since at least Lyndon Johnson and  even at that Johnson was a state diplomat when compared to Trump...big ego  huge mouth  and small hands.,?

2305,"Infected restaurant workers often are the source of outbreaks" ------------------------ Perhaps Chipotle has poor sick time policies and not a problem with  kitchen prep work.,?
2306,At least with the wall  Trump knew it was probably the least most important item on his agenda  but needs it built because of his promise to his "base".  In this case  it's more divisiveness  because he knows issues such as this "empower" his administration by raising the ire of the majority of the country  where otherwise he'd be playing to only 37% of the country.    Can't help but wonder where this falls on his agenda of "least" important items.   The majority of the country deserve to know what this administration is doing now  how they have improved screenings  for example  what they have accomplished that actually make a real impact towards improving the security for this country?     So  the way it is messaged  it again looks like agenda before country.  Unfortunately for many Republican lawmakers  they have decided that it's ok to ride on the Trump train where ever it might lead  and put their "base" before country.,?

2311,Dude you are a freaking idiot criminals are going to obtain weapons illegally by theft or stealing or any way they can. if you think that banning guns is the right thing to do you need to go out and and see what it smells like underwater. I am a law-abiding citizen and I carry a gun all the time for someone like me I want to be able to defend myself or defend other people if need be.  you are probably voting for Hillary Clinton and for that I am sorry. I hope one day you wake up and realize that if there's a guy with a gun he's going to shoot you and you going to sit there with your thumb up your ass and won't do anything about it it is our 2nd Amendment right to bear arms. have a great 4th of July,?
2312,The issues surrounding the ethics commissioner is symptomatic of a larger problem in Ottawa  that of a largely spineless senior civil service. The best recent example is the Phenix payroll system. Where is the sense of responsibilities  outrage and urgency to stop the waste of money? To often  we see the federal civil service taking coverage behind practices that ultimately result in diminished rights or development opportunities for Canadians.,?

2315,Der-mot wants an income tax as opposed to just keeping the PDF  that way half of the states citizens would get to keep some their PFD. The other half (the hard working middle class) would get the additional tax and that would amount to the the same as giving up ALL of their PFD. For some reason Der-mot thinks that's fair. What world does he live in? O'yeah a liberal one!,?
2316,Yes  taxes are higher. OTOH  no medical insurance (part of the taxes); No costs for schools  including through universities; no costs for public transportation; etc. etc. etc.  Basically  they minimize their govs  and then have them do the smart things  while making better use of capitalism than China or even America.   All in all  when we look at costs  the swiss and northern EUrope have much high living standards than America due to making smart choices.,?

2319,Watched the exchange and what amazed me was Franken taking much time to lay the libtard progressive agenda in the form of a question.  Sessions did well in answering the questions and setting the issues straight  even when being rudely interrupted by Franken.  Of course  being a libtard  it is no surprise of Franken's behavior....rude.  It was also funny watching Franken stumbling over himself  having no rehearsed script from which to read from  when he was forced to attempt to think of a response to Sessions bombarding him with factual information.  Again  when you confront a libtard with facts  they become dumbfounded and spew out lies and hate.  Just look at the libards here. LOL.  What was also entertaining was watching Hawaii's own Lazy Mazy's questioning of Sessions.  Her questions had no point or direction.  They were flat out weak and it was as if she was quickly given a few facts to regurgitate.  She is clearly out of her league there.  Thanks libtards for voting her in.,?
2320,How better to encourage the next propaganda-driven war sending the poor  the naïve  and the ignorant to their deaths like lemmings for the greater good of another man's wallet then to celebrate a past war.  Beware our pro-Trump lapdog PM who recently endorsed the despicable Trump's illegal and immoral airstrike in the name of Canada's "commitment to peace."  LOL!  Why else do we have troops in Latvia?,?
2321,Hmmm  did Trump get a sex change or don't you know that a male witch is called a warlock? I think the amusing part on this play is the fact that Trump feels persecuted prior to getting prosecuted.  And yet  and yet  he can't keep his mouth shut or let the twittering for a few days.  Actually he is quite pathetic!,?

2323,This is not religious discrimination  this is a douche bag trying to be "special" by way of cultural appropriation.,?
2324,There are very few genuinely "natural" forests left in Cascadia. Given the changes in climate and land use  it even becomes difficult to ascertain what "natural" even means anymore. Even the fragmented  dried out patches of old growth are not really "natural" anymore.   Nobody wants to go back to before Columbus; the wider world in which our ancient forests formed no longer exists. Wild nature needs space to redefine itself  to establish a new equilibrium for the Anthropocene; but it will need our help to find that breathing room  that new balance.  You're half-right that preservation doesn't make any sense if there's nothing to preserve but ultra-flammable  brush-choked  overplanted forestland.  But neither is conventional "forest management" the answer to Cascadia's ecological crisis. The conventional cycle of clear cut  and replant is the reason for the crisis in the first place.   We're not going back to before 1492; but neither can we go back to days of the timber boom.,?

2341,I'm not sure about the "executed" part  but I have to agree that outing spy methods is not in the national interest and it actually harms the ability of these agencies to protect its citizens.  What is missing in all of this is any evidence (whatsoever) that the CIA is using these methods improperly.  If that were the evidence  then perhaps a leak was morally appropriate.  But absent such evidence  this action just harms national security and unnecessarily furthers conspiratorial and paranoid beliefs.,?

2349,Health insurers need to look ahead at where things might be going when setting rates.  If Trump is claiming that he is going to end a subsidy that those companies are relying on  then  yes  they will raise rates  and it has to do with what Trump and the rest of the Rs say they are going to do.,?

2353,Ruth is lying. No one threatened anyone.   She just needs place all of this group blame to make Lee's exclamation of "Hell yea" somehow egregious  so she can justify this petty  childish  stupid revenge rule.

2355,Siemian's HORRIBLE. And it's not just the ridiculous interceptions. He's terrible in literally EVERY facet of the game. Even when the pocket's clean  his throws are rarely on target. If there IS pressure  he doesn't feel it and gets sacked &/or fumbles. But if there ISN'T pressure  he sees ghosts and panics ANYWAY. And he COMPLETELY stares down his primary receiver. And THEN  he throws a crucial 2 point conversion WAY out the back of the end zone  when it would've been better to throw it DIRECTLY to a Chief  like he did numerous OTHER times during the game  & at least they might've accidentally TIP it to a Bronco. When he AIR MAILED it 10 feet over his head  DT had NO chance.  And Joseph? We heard that he was such a red hot coaching commodity  but the FIRST time I heard him try to speak  my heart dropped. And AGAIN  he said that we CAN'T make a QB change if it's a 2 possession game. WTF?! So if a QB throws 6 picks but the D balls out  we can't bench the QB?! These 2 are KILLING us.,?
2356,Actually  it's been proven that a death sentence is more expensive to carry out than a life sentence.  And prisoners themselves say that they prefer execution to a life in prison.,?

Is this man telling me that because I am white and lived through the 'aparheid era' that I have failed as a moral human being? This is absolute rubbish as he knows nothing about me  or for that matter many other white South Africans.

2376,Kim Jong-Eun  North Korean dictator  is a genocidal murderer. A genocidal murderer is one who seeks to annihilate a specific group  defined by inherent characteristics (race  tribe  language  etc.) or belief (political  religious  etc.).   Such regimes must be destroyed as quickly and as completely as possible: all  who are employed by the government are fair targets  especially those in the military and police services of such regimes. They are to be killed on sight  whenever possible.. Every day such regimes exist  they murder.   Those  who stand by  while such murders occur  are complicit. The U.S. and the Russian Federation have been complicit in the murders committed by Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. The U.S.  Russia  China  and the European Union for decades have been complicit in the murders committed by Kim Jong-Eun and his equally genocidal predecessors.  Mr. Trump  at last speaks of action!!! Job #1: Kill Mr Kim  his sister  and any other close relatives!!!!,?

Yes Hawaii is a democratic state so most of government is controlled by democrats.  So what?  What makes you think republicans would not be far worse?  I remember the days when Hawaii was controlled by republicans.   As my mother used to say  try and find an Asian or black member at Oahu Country Club.  Discrimination anyone?  No problem.   And as for the federal budget  yes that is all republicans.  Clinton left the country with a balanced budget but you so called fiscally responsible republicans blew it up and finally left the country with a trillion plus deficit.  What hypocrites you are.

2400,Except if you continue to have a system where I can work in Alaska and make really good wages on the slope before I leave for the outside  I contribute nothing to the coffers.  The gross wages paid in Alaska is known information as employers report all wages to the DOL.  It is not rocket science to cross reference that information and determine who takes the money and leaves.  I relive the results of releasing that information would indicate far more than 20% of all wages paid in Alaska goes outside tax free.,?

2420,What a truly bizarre letter. Increasing jail and prison beds has been a right-wing priority for almost my entire life. Seriously  when was the last time a non-Republican ran for office as a "Law and Order" candidate?  As to the funding woes in our education system  it wasn't liberals who pushed our taxes so low that we can't educate our children. It is a rare right-winger who doesn't love lowering taxes no matter the consequences.  The state of our county  state and nation is far from healthy. However  we have reached this situation because of nearly four-decades of right-wing dominance at the national level that has led to everyone thinking we can do everything on the cheap and that government is always the problem. Frankly  I find things like burning rivers to be more of a problem  but I'm not a right-winger.,?
2421,Mayor Caldwell is indeed the worst Honolulu City and County Mayor has ever had.  But the powerful liberal Democratic party keeps this guy in for another term.    Caldwell tries to convince the over-tax burden of this State of the need to "tax more"  scratch more dollars from our family budget.  There is no compassion for the citizen of this island  period!.     Our only hope is for the City council which will look at his proposal  to show compassion for its citizen.  He now wants to charge every single family home a monthly $10.00 fee for garbage pickup.  He puts a stupid ridiculous reason for the fee - because other homes pay a fee to private garbage pickup that we should pay too.  Nonsense!!!!  Apure baloney nonsense!!.,?
2422,The complete government fools in charge who allow the vagrants to despoil the landscape with their presence  their excrement and their garbage  would have been tarred and feathered in more sane times. Why not arrest and put away those creeps immediately ? Given the riffraff "notice" before they clear them out AFTER they were allowed to produce tons of garbage - what polite stupidity.,?
2423,I'm very confused as to what you are saying exactly because on your Facebook profile  you show a picture from this past Monday picketing while Murkowski was in town.

2429,Starting Assweiler was stupid  committing to Trevor was stupid. Being soft with Lynch's injury was stupid  ending Kelly's season on IR was stupid. Last night it wasn't the line  the line looked a lot better  it was the QB  the defense not being able to carry the team when the offense can't score and it was the coaching. This might be Vance Joseph's only season in Denver  the team looked uninspired. Cut Brock  start Lynch and put Trevor at backup where he belongs  because if we have to put up with a losing season then we should at least give the rookie a shot to see what he can do. I would have rather Lynch and Kelly at 1 and 2 and see what both rookies have. I have no reason to believe that  with the QBs Denver has  that the season can be salvaged. Can't win games if you turn the ball over and can't score TDs  might as well see what the future has if that's going to be the case.,?
2430,I would say redirecting some of the wealth to the bottom would go a long way to making things fairer. Especially via estate taxes because then you aren't depriving someone of wealth they actually earned  just that they were born into. I would say universal healthcare makes it fairer. And I would say universal basic income really makes it fairer.,?

Maybe they do for the folks they like  dunno  I never even name called any officer for doing his job  I was always mad at others and directed it at not at bystanders.

2462,This is a poor piece of legal reporting.  Nowhere does the article explain exactly what the Binkleys are offering for the ADN.  It mentions that they've loaned the publication money (but not how much)  and far down in the article the creditors' attorney alludes to "the current $1 million deal." If that is what the Binkleys are offering  the information should have come much higher in the article  and in the voice of the reporter--implying she has verified the information.  And does a $1 million offer that mean they've loaned $1 million and want to acquire the paper in exchange for that debt?  Are they offering $1 million cash in addition to waiving the debt?  Where does the "good faith" requirement come in?  How could the Binkleys have behaved in bad faith?  I'm not denying that's possible  I'm merely commenting that the article should have explained these things.,?

2464,Here again We the People can't be responsible  we need government to tell us what to do. Is texting dangerous? It would be for me  so I don't do it  I pull off if I have to text. However  watching some texts  I'm amazed at how fast their thumbs work  I didn't think a thumb could move that fast.   Last week there were several letter about congestion  if the traffic is stop and go  and the top speed is 15 20 mph  is texting for many a problem? But if the traffic opens and the speed increases  those texting  I would hope have enough responsibility to put the phone down. We the People have more control over our lives then we think  sometimes. JUST BE RESPONSIBLE.,?

2466,I'm sure the dispensaries will be thrilled if the govt. continues to drag their feet! In this fast growing market producers don't have to pay taxes on their production and huge cash sales volumes can be manipulated to reduce sales taxes. There's a few big players who are obviously generating multi millions of dollars in sales while the govt. drag their feet. I should have ignored the law and jumped in full force a year or two ago! What an opportunity this long drawn out fiasco has created.,?
2467,Finally someone with common sense. Most of the comments aren't worth responding to. Comey is part of 8 years of corruption. I'm not an attorney  but it was really bizarre when Comey went through a litany of actions (all seemingly against the law) about Hillary and her emails  then concluded that no prosecutor would bring charges  which is not even his job to make such a recommendation. It's been downhill since with comments "all across the board".  Loretta Lynch fiasco meeting with Bill  Clinton on the tarmac shows Hilary and Bill feel they are above the law. What I find interesting is how Democrats have no problem with anything the Clintons do. We all are fortunate Hillary lost the election. Now Schumer and the rest want a special prosecutor so it will drag on into the 2018 elections so the media and the Dems can continue to prosecute Trump. And finally  Get used to Trump making decisions as an executive would. He's a breath of fresh air; drain the swamp!,?

2477,What about issuing zoning variances to infill open spaces.  Has the tiny house crowd ever advocated for variances?,?
2478,You're an angry elf ...,?
2479,What does any of this have to do with Trump. It's a stupid investigation. They should be looking into Hillary and the Obama administration for all the illegal doings they have done. Whatever Manaforte did  has nothing to do with Trump. So much hate for Trump that they will do anything to try to impeach him. Really pathetic.,?
2480,Just more fuel for the Trumpster fire. He's an idiot and the idiotic things he does are all there is to talk about.,?
2481,Well  the wedding cake issue is also about expression -- i.e.  free speech; and also about association. The owner of the cake-decorator shop reasonably is concerned about the *association* of the business  and him- or herself  with a cause s/he doesn't support.  So  for example  can a vendor refuse to cater  say a Trump event  because s/he wants nothing to do with Trump? Can a dress-maker refuse to supply dresses for Mrs. Trump -- aware that his or her name will be attached to the Trump "brand"?  So with photographers  graphic artists  and a whole host of folks.,?
2482,Our Prime Minister  an authority in these matters  has stated that Canada has no core identity.  Consequently any attempt to fund Canadian culture is a fruitless endeavour.,?
2483,LOL! Who purported to fire state governors? Your post is ridiculous and your credibility zero.,?
2484,Oh  it definitely does!  The problem is  stupid usually ends up hurting innocent victims as well.,?

2488,You are very sick!,?
2489,Trump is delusional in addition to being a sore loser.  AND he is being beat by a girl.  Karma.,?
2490,You questioning other's intelligence is hilarious.  Anyone stupid enough to buy the NFL protest lie shouldn't try to match smarts with anyone else.  But please  continue to spend yourself into debt to support overpaid children who are stupid enough to bite the hand that feeds them--I make a lot of money on foreclosed houses.  Yours could be next.,?
2491,Uss he went on and on about how wonderful Obama was and how we need for more years of the se with inton  you would have found it undeniably whelming.  Just long enough to day he did?!! How long did you spend in theater?  A day? A week?  I bet you voted for Al Gore. So spare us  please.   While I might disagree with the politics I would be proud a if Begich wad selected to speak. But I have only been here three years. I guess I'm still prod to be.part of this state more than I am a political party.,?
2492,What an ass.,?
2493,Once the worst of the storm had passed  however  the playbook changed entirely  emphasizing a lesson of any major market event: They can present once-in-a-lifetime buying opportunities. -- Since 2008/9 provided once-in-a-lifetime buying opportunities  I don't have to bother waiting for them to show up again in my lifetime.,?
2494,There's a difference between pandering and using thoughtful  intentional language designed to unite. Great rhetoric is a gift. People like Jefferson  Lincoln and FDR inspired people with their words to rise above their selfish interests and find nobility and unity of purpose. Trump's use of language is appalling. He rarely gives the impression that he's put any thought at all into what he says  and his most notable phrases are all caustic.  There's no "Ask not what your country can do for you" in Trump's toolkit. The gist of his tiresome spiels is "Get yours and screw everybody else." Sure  that appeals to a certain segment of perpetually discontented people (who  by the way  are still going to be discontented long after Trump's gone.) But it sure doesn't inspire anybody.  Okay  moving on. Have a nice day.,?
2495,There is hope - the last provincial by-election in Scarborough-Rouge River kicked out the Lieberal MPP.  Can't say to much about the IQ level of Ottawa Vanier that voted the Lieberal's back in.   Can't fix stupid!,?
2496,What a load.   We just sold my parents’ house in Toronto. 14 offers in under one week  all 35% over asking  all but one from mainland China.  These stupid governments have saddled Canadian’s with high taxes  high school debt  housing prices that the average Canadian could not possibly afford  and jobs that are going offshore.  Of course the real-estate association does not want to stop it  they are making a killing.   And they wonder why the general public is unhappy and fed up  leading to Trump. But these same idiots keep telling themselves it won’t happen here  because of some moral superiority. Ya right,?
2497,I absolutely do not sympathize with Tripathi. Issaquah is full of horrible drivers and I'd never ever get into a discussion over a traffic situation that already resolved itself. People in rage will say anything they can think of  so if that was a "blonde woman" the man would still have been in rage  and have said something about her weight  car  whatever he could find. Don't argue with antisocial strangers or you will have to swallow their bitter nonsense. If the man hadn't been white  this article would not exist.,?
2498,Even Sophie got involved  http://www.quebecentreprises.com/aliments-s-trudeau-inc-7ubm/,?
2499,I think it's time to drop NAFTA and completely close the border to shopping in the US.   Maybe the idiot T-Rump will think differently after US businesses suffer a little from the complete removal of CAD$.  We can trade directly with Mexico - we need their Tequila!!  ;o),?
2500,Oliver is the funniest guy on Television at the moment ...and if he can manage to avoid overdosing on Trump I will watch him.   We don't need the comedians to make us laugh or cry about Trump  we can watch the news for that.   SNL should stick to comedy and tone down the politics.. and... who else is sick of Bill Maher? He has become an  angry smug white liberal and every bit the  same type of  bully  he pretends to defend us from..,?
2501,Make America Crap Again. Just how many young black men have been gunned down by the Crips??? Eff You Snoopy,?
2502,What a ridiculous article. This is what the press if focused on?  Might as well read the National Enquirer. Great job DP. Of course your pathetic paper can't afford to do anything but parrot AP or Wapo.,?
2503,obviously a racist. Probably uneducated or worse,?
2504,Shameful behaviour from the audience.    Meanwhile the article repeats this lie:  "a video surfaced in which he boasted about grabbing women’s genitals."  He boasted that famous people like himself *could*  not *did*.,?
2505,This man here is a big fan of sexual assault!,?
2506,What a stoopid comment! Typical Chumpster comments because their brain is dysfunctional they speak through their wrecktum.,?
2507,How the hell would you know what goes on in rural villages  Kearon.  Haven't you lived 99.9% of your life in New York?  Please enlighten us as to when was the first and last time you were in a Native village.  Come on now  be very specific and tell us what your purpose was being in that village.  As always  your ass(umptions) are skewed.,?
2508,Next to leave and be thrown under the dTrump0 endless but effective bus will be Spicer after JOE TRUDEAU calls his cohort in crime dTrump0 to ask "do you remember who you met YESTERDAY?

2510,Regarding: ""I don't remember any other time in our order's history of having such media publicity or high media profile " Bertero told CNS." - While they make a good point that the Knights and Dames of Malta had bright public lights put upon their internal operations -- all to good effect  it is a bit much to think that before 1978  anything like todays media capabilities existed in the previous 850 years of so. That is  it was way easier to avoid scrutiny by the faithful as the faithful had no way to determine what would have been going on behind what they were being told by the leaders of the knights  or even by the Holy See and via the chaplain she assigned to the knights.  - Writing of the chaplain; notice that his 'stirring the pot' does not even merit an allusion. - Is ArchbRaymond  known to be the mass priest to the knights and dames  still the albeit superannuated chaplain?,?
2511,Whats the  difference between OK and AK?  Nothing   Two of the most conservative and overweight  unhealthy populations in America.  These two states are the most denying about global warming. Now they are in to debt  cutting school funding and rewarding Big Oil     Tulsan Kaiser is correct in this article and he is a true oilman  not the dimwits in Juneau lob-"buying" the legislature to protect their own industry.  Kaiser steps to the plate everyday in Tulsa with his billions in philanthropy after he pays his taxes. He builds really big hospitals for free!. There is no oilman like that in Alaska.  Alyeska  BP  Arco give pittance to United Way only to match their employees contributions.  When was the last time Big Oil in Alaska really made a social contribution that made a difference  like Kaiser  Warren  Wade Phillips  in OK.  Alaska just need to grow up.,?
2512,What Constitution? -  Canada's Constitution is joke - it provides no UNALIENABLE rights to its' citizens. The Charter is constantly being overruled and overwritten by whatever politicians "hears voices from above..." - The Constitution should be torn up and re-written. Remove 'God' and remove the ability for politicians to create laws that over ride the Charter. Also remove the special rights for special groups. Equal rights for everyone and always! - Canadians want real rights and freedoms.,?
2513,Top Guns is a reality shooting competition involving some of the best marksmen in the nation.  With only the stress of competition and either fixed or side-moving targets  most of them fail with pistols.  Most people who own pistols couldn't hit the broad side of a barn standing still much less an attacking bear.  A human being has milli-seconds to react to a charge.  A false sense of security is the only result of packing a pistol for "protection" in the wilderness.,?
2514,Trump is a sociopath.  His sycophants make up every excuse imaginable to wave away his mental illness  but it's on display for the entire world to see.  Worst President Ever.  He needs to be removed from office as soon as possible.,?
2515,OK  at first I was feeling bad for those that OD'd on this cr@p  but now it's getting down right stupid. Every news outlet  online  print  radio and TV has been reporting on how dangerous that stuff is. Sorry  but all my sympathy is used up.,?
2516,Gosh  golly  gee  I thought one of the big imperatives from the McCleary decision was to move teacher salary funding from a combination of local levies and state funding to a fully state funded model which this agreement does  to a large extent.  But  but  but  the union doesn't seem happy about this...oh my goodness  what a surprise.  LOL.,?
2517,"just curious what your take on it is."  That is part of the problem - you rarely offer up a meaningful comment.  No not one I have to agree with - but one that is well thought out and a basis in standard finance  accounting and economic terms.  Simply stringing together a collection of random thoughts or demanding that others research the topic for you rarely promotes much of a discussion.  Perfect example:  "Any deep thoughts on what happened to the TSX today ???",?
2518,MSM did not sell us on the Iraq war and WMDs  that was the Bush administration. See how that administration ripped Iraq apart?,?
2519,PS. I would not describe the restaurant royalty outfits as dividend growth stocks in that they do not have regular annual dividend increases. However they do have increases and on occasion more than one in a year. For example BPF.UN has had 18 increases since its IPO in 2002 and PZA has had 13 increases since its IPO in 2005 (both had a dividend cut when the SIFT tax was introduced in 2011 but the distributions changed from being primarily Other Income to eligible dividends).  Although I purchased them primarily for the dividend income there has been reasonably good capital appreciation as well which is a bonus  e.g. ACB on BPF.UN of $14.59 and ACB on PZA of $8.98 in my non-reg account.,?
2520,Did you listen to the part of the video where they say "f#@% white people" as they beat him and cut him with a knife? Don't be stupid.,?
2521,"The bitter barn." What a good moniker for people who only come online to bitch. The story could be about rescued kittens and they'd find something wrong with it.,?
2522,More pandering to special interest groups  minorities and lobbyists......how pathetic of the Liberals to continue to piss our tax dollars away.,?
2523,So Colorado made what... 3 billion dollars last year off of marijuana. Here they are fighting it tooth & nail and more worried about stealing a 1000 dollars from each of us. Step over a dollar  pick up a dime. Idiots,?
2524,I am leasing my panels for ~$60/mo on a 20-year lease. They were installed before residential batteries were available. I chuckle every time the check I write to xcel is only $30 or so.  Solar farms also allow someone who doesn't want to/can't install panels to hook up to a renewable source. There is also windsource if you want to buy renewable energy in a roundabout way.,?
2525,The point is that the driver did NOT stop to render or call for aid. The driver hit him and left him to die. I have had some very scary times when driving at night and suddenly realizing that there was people standing in the middle of the highway. I live in a community where we have four traffic lights and where we got 1million tourists this summer who never seem to look before they step out. We have crossing guards on the downtown streets to help keep them safe but sometimes they step right out even when the guard tells them not to. I have stopped when a man was hit  I wasn’t driving but I could have walked away without helping. Instead I stayed with him until he was loaded into the ambulance and then rode to the hospital in a police car so I could stay with his wife while he was in surgery  that happened in Anchorage in 2001. I have stopped when I have seen dogs run over to see if I could help.  I would like to think I would stop if I hit a person or a animal. I hope I never have to,?

Please tell me. Does anyone know? Mr Prosecutor? Judge? Probation officer? Man you guys are asleep at the wheel. If it had been someone you cared about who was the victim this POS would be serving 5 years in the hole.  Cmon man!!!! Stop coddling these dregs and do your job!!!!!,?
2529,Senator McGuire: What budget cuts did you recommend in the past 10 years?,?
2530,hmmm... as a Hypocrite Hunter  I must say that this story should be front row center up on the Globe's page. Woodbridge Workers: do take the time to read the story a few times over if you need to - it's not all about the Quebec spying thing - "PRESS FREEDOM ON THE DIVERSITY OF OPINIONS TOLERATED" - Write it on the blackboard 50 times if you have to  and stop deleting mine and others comments with such lackluster judicial concern or flagrant suppression of diversity. Like the kid says: diversity is our strength. Make Canada (news) Great Again!,?

2538,I think this project is to widen the road enough to give it shoulders. The hope is that this will somehow create a situation where motorists don't get their knickers in a twist every time they encounter someone riding a bike along there. I expect it will simply increase the speed of the motorists and make the roadway even more deadly.  ODOT did happily take a potful of money from the family of the late Jane Higdon  who was killed eleven years ago on that stretch of road  in order to "study" the situation and propose solutions.  See ORS 811.065  put into place in response to Ms Higdon's death.,?

2542,In many ways this is worse; at least Sandwich Isles had to go through an existing program  codified under the Code of Federal Regulations  with a specific applications process open to all  with an established scoring system and provisions for monitoring.  Further the only reason they got in trouble is that they violated the rules of the program.  These state grant-in -aids are really just political give-aways.  Very little oversight and rules for accountability.  In both cases politics play a huge role.  Now its up to the Governor to release or hold back the grant.  Thanks to this news story exposing this shady deal  hopefully the a Governor facing re-election will elect not to release these funds.,?
2543,let alone the constant stream of side loaders and freight trucks which weigh 10 to 20 times more than some Toyota Corrola with studs.  No the Toyota is doing ALL the damage according to now asphalt expert Cathy Giessel.,?
2544,I don't defend any "violent imbeciles."  quite the contrary.  Are you suggesting that the White Supremicists/White Nationalists should be "allowed" to march and protest for white supremacy without anyone counter-protesting?  If  indeed  the "battle has already been won"  could you please tell the white supremacists/white nationalists and ask them to quit working for their goals of racial supremacy.  BTW: You ascribe the responsibility for violence to the "counter-protesters".......The most specific act of extreme violence was the driving of a car into the crowd of "counter-protesters."  Since many in that crowd were black (I'm guessing not many of the white supremacists/white nationalists were black)  there's little doubt which "side" was guilty of the violence which caused serious injury and death.

2546,Because you dishonestly added that the waivers are "are very difficult to obtain."  That's not true.  If the condition - like many other medical conditions - is properly managed  there's nothing difficult about it.  Your comments are wrong because you add details that make them untrue.,?
2547,Sooooooo? Not everyone is swallowing the crap you're selling?,?
2548,I'd be curious if there was any contradiction between what the people of the area remember and any more impersonal observational data. Also wonder if there is any contradiction between what different people recall as an individual human memory is a notoriously skewed vehicle. The answers may be no to be questions  but I still wonder.,?
2549," A language stays alive because people want to speak and use it".   That is a rather simplistic view. Languages are lost when the conditions for their survival and flourishing no longer exist  e.g. when a society is dominated by another and its social and communication structures are either destroyed  or cannot compete.   What government policies can do is reinforce those social and communication structures.,?

I am a college  educated white woman who has worked and travelled. I have friends of all colors and backgrounds  and I am NOT an ideologue.  The reason I voted for Mr. Trump is because I am tired of you and your elite buddies lying to get elected   and then REFUSING to listen to our concerns while you vote yourselves into prosperity!,?

2572,Republican president Lincoln described our form of government as "of  by  and for the people " yet Republicans are usually the first to erupt in protest if such government is actually proposed (usually by left-wing democrats). As long as we are required by our pay-to-play system to choose the lesser evil from two major (if similar) parties we will be  ipso facto  ruled by evil. We've talked about democracy for hundreds of years. Why not try it? Most government decisions are not NOT crisis in nature  and we COULD make them by majority rule. With off the shelf technology (properly watchdogged by representatives who would no longer be our masters but our servants) we could make decisions with less influence by special interests whose largess  to sympathetic or compliant candidates gives them more influence than the majority. The elite LOVE this partisan hoopla between wings of the corporate war party because no matter whether you vote D or R  the rich win. They own both parties.,?
2573,Now let's hear from a white person posing as a black anti white racist after being in the echo chamber of anti white racism. Cynthia G on YouTube for example though her channel was taken down recently because of 'hate speech' according to YouTube TOS. But there are MANY similar channels where people go on and on and on about whites being inferior race  whites are devils  whites should be raped and die in comment after comment after comment.  Ugly all of it. There's plenty of hate and blame to go around. Some hate just gets excused while other hate doesn't. For me it's all the same. Hate.,?

2582,"It's called OPM. I do it all the time in business. It's called other people's money " Trump said. "There's nothing like doing things with other people's money because it takes the risk -- you get a good chunk out of it and it takes the risk."  Trump is using Americans' tax dollars to pay for an investigation that is nothing but a pathetic and desperate attempt to create a distraction from his train wreck of a presidency and its dalliance with the Russians. Very sad  as he likes to say.,?

2585,At the risk of invoking Godwin's Law  I am surprised to see comments about Mussolini  but none about Speer and the Nazis.  While neo-classicism was a feature of some of the construction in 30s and 40s Germany  it wasn't the only approach.  From Wikipedia:  Nazi ideology took a pluralist attitude to architecture; however  Adolf Hitler himself believed that form should follow function and wrote against "stupid imitations of the past",?

2590,It will soon be at our expense too : I still recall sixteen years ago when we made fun about how corrupt and incompetent Bush and Cheney were. ............. Then the WTC was destroyed  and then they lied their gullible nation into invading Iraq  then the American bodies started piling up ......... and fewer people were laughing. ............. Then their stupid Republican policies destroyed the world economy ........ and not even Canadians were laughing.,?
2591,Why is Donald so concerned with what the Russian's think? He needs to know the entire world is laughing at him. The Russian's and everyone else find it amusing how Donald pushes his nose around Europe  and how this pathetic little man is crumbling..,?
2592,Is that on a flash card  cause obviously your to stupid to think of it yourself. Your about as much of a conservative as Trump. Hell I was a conservative before you could spell it. Still am  not one of those fakes like you who just came out from under the house when Donald Trump and his racist crap made you think it was safe.,?
2593,Name one government agency that is efficient. My faith in government at any level is diminishing rapidly. Government has little in the way of accountability and is grossly inefficient.  People seem to feel powerless if the percentage of voter turnout is any indication. Lobbyists run this state and this country. The single difference with the Alaska economy is shipping. We have to ship most commodities into the state. But for that what is the difference except for greed. I suggest you watch the documentary "Inside Job". You'll get the idea.,?
2594,"there are no liberals with intelligence."

2595,PERS retirement payments--about 350 million dollars in Lane County alone each year are a benefit to all.  Retirees are not burying it in the backyard.  They spend most of it.  Here.  To create jobs and help fund the "private sector" economy.  Remember  the majority of the fund's capital comes from investment earnings.  Not as much as everyone would like in recent years  but still the majority.  I am delighted PERS retirees are spending the majority of their pension here.  I look at it as another tax rebate.  Speaking of rebates....  I don't see it as fair to ditch a contractual compensation agreement  while at the same time voting yourself constitutionally protected tax rebates  which chronically starve the state budget.  Oregon has a lot of resources available to meet its obligations and it must find a way to meet this one-- for several more decades.,?
2596,' Trump is a buffoon.,?
2597,She has PRINCIPLES? blah blah blah  her principle is to not acknowledge the results of a democratic elections to be a sore loser to be a malcontent stewing in the winter of her leftist discontent to be a bad sports to sulk when things don't go her way  some principles ! typical of the anti Trump left,?
2598,Hey another mayor who if you  had made the preparations necessary the heartache that is being felt would be much less.  You and your administrations did nothing in the way of building shelters  stocking food and water etc.  instead you and the rest of Puerto Rico spent money foolishly and went bankrupt!  Of course like all the others like you  you now are crying your left wing nonsense and want the American government to bail out you and yours for your failures.  Go drink some dirty water.  You are a failure.,?

2602,Say what?! Andrew Scheer doesn't hold a public office??? Excuse me  Mr Scheer  but you are the Leader of Her Majesty's Official Opposition. That's a public office. It comes with a significant pay raise  office staff  and the perks of a mansion and the privileges of being a member of the Queen's Privy Council. Scheer doesn't seem to know how parliamentary government works.,?
2603,You must be telepathic. Cats  like all small animals that are potential prey  have an evolutionary tendency not to display signs of injury or discomfort. They appear very stoic. That's why it is a good idea to inspect them closely for signs of abcesses  infected teeth  etc. at regular intervals. All of my cats  at one stage of their lives have had free access to the outdoors  and they all lived to an advanced age.,?

2613,The concept of Trump returning blacks to slavery was all over the internet.  It would have been very easy for a 10 year old to be exposed to this concept.

2623,NO 'that message' is that a person is no longer judged solely on the crime  a person is judged on unrelated information years after the fact. The stupid tweets years after the fact  are irrelevant to this case!,?
2624,Is that comment directed at me? If so  how outrageously funny.  "Unfortunately  Alberta is beginning to build a bit of a reputation for this sort of thing...."

2627,Wow  you're easily brainwashed by a lazy columnist.,?
2628,Shame you don't believe in the constitution.  I understand.  You would prefer big government to make decisions for you.    This would be a problem only if they defend only Neo Nazia and the KKK.  They do not.  They will defend just about anyone.,?
2629,You a fool...,?
2630,If you equate Trump as the prototype Republican  then I completely agree with you.   I probably agree with more Democratic objectives  but I don't agree that all that require federal administration.   Their are corrupted members of both parties and I don't want partisan bias to make me look away from shenanigans of either party.       IMO neither party feels like it sincerely cares for all Americans.    I generally think of D as inclusive and R as exclusive.   Trump found the 'left out' and pulled the votes.   He will make policy that most benefites the already wealthy.   That will be clear soon enough.   We'll see what Democrats do to support private wage earners and new objectives for collective bargaining with private ownership.,?
2631,I agree but I'd avoid a device that fits all. Impairment is also a perception. For example  I have a friend who speaks slowly and deliberately. Some see this as impairment when he's simply not as fast as other people. I once followed a meandering Mercedes on 126 at speeds ranging from 25 to 30 mph. Turned out to be a very elderly man looking for an address who had no idea he was a hazard. Driving defensively with acute awareness is my best hope.,?

2636,And you show your  hypocrisy by showing your hatred for Harper! Sad!,?
2637,I am a democrat. Please don't tell me we are this stupid. Being married to the president does not qualify you to be president. Trump is undoubtedly hoping this will happen as it would be handing him re-election on a silver platter. May be even worse than running Hillary again.,?
2638,Agree Billy boy was dodging the draft and also bad mouthing the USA at the same time and was still elected President.  Trump may have dodged the draft but he did so within the confines of the USA and did it in accordance with the law.,?

2647,LOL...zerohedge? C'mon man! I read that article and it is so full of bs. If everything in the article was true (it ain't) would does that say about Fredo Jr's  Kushner's  and Manfort's judgement that they would be so easily tricked into taking a meeting with these people? LOL...so stupid!....And by the way  what are still doing here? Haven't you moved to Russia yet? Aren't you the guy who publicly stated on here that you trust Putin and the Kremlin over fellow Americans?,?
2648,It is amazing what the liberals to do to try and make sure they control the white house and continue to destroy America.  Another 8 years of liberalism would have certainly did it.  Can you imagine how they would be acting if the shoe was on the other foot and it was conservatives out rioting  protesting  blocking traffic  filing election lawsuits  grasping at straws?,?
2649,Isn't Broncos Pkwy and Jordan a block away from Sheriff station? Not that carjacking and running are smart  but this group of 5 are extra stupid. Hope they enjoy a long jail term (minor included),?
2650,You could call it the Platonic sexual ideal. Same idiocy  different day. Look up both if you don’t believe me. Being modern  by the way  is not a bad thing considering what superstition of the pre-modern era  including in the first century.,?
2651,Why the defensiveness about this report?,?
2652,"The guy is completely bonkers."  Well yes  but that has been apparent for some time now.,?
2653,Which only proves the stupid rabid homophobia of both Russia and it's bosom kin  the Deep South  that except for the revelation of a minor character's possible same sex attraction    it's okay for the female lead to fall in love with a talking buffalo/wolf hybrid.,?

2656,as much s I loathe you  I don't want to see you go to jail for assault  and then pay me thousands of dollars in restitution  old soul. How about we meet at the tough guy gym where we can sign the waivers  get in the ring  and that way you don't have to go to jail right after you get the living crap beat out of you.  I learned a long time ago  when the clown is a shameless hypocrite incapable of manning up  people like you are just as innept in the ring as you are debate.,?
2657,I'm in the UK. I'm wondering why anyone is allowed to start a campfire just about anywhere. Is that really what happens?  Excuse me if I'm wrong  but there should be well-cleared and designated areas for camp fires in National Parks.  Starting a fire outside of these areas should be a criminal offense.   OK  most people have a brain and a good degree of common sense. But do we allow just any idiot to go into the wild and start a fire? Let's face it. As the population increases  so more idiots are born. You only have to go on YouTube to see how dumb some folk can be.  Something has got to change.,?
2658,This egotistical  mentally unstable and incompetent moron that tries to have "his people" run the country from a golf resort will do anything to boost his shattered ego. If people get in the way  well  that's just not his problem.,?
2659,FUCK OFF AUTOPLAY.,?
2660,You obviously do not know me. I can only hope that some day you can weed through all the possibilities  & figure out who your daddy was.,?
2661,i recall recently seeing the flight attendants from a middle eastern airline (perhaps Saudi?) and their uniforms were simply breathtaking. Cream suits  red pillbox hats with a red scarf  and red pumps. Very classy and very memorable. It saddened me to recall the uniforms of our Canadian-based airlines.,?
2662,Trump is an admitted sexual predator.  And Newt's mistress was just named Ambassador to the Vatican by Trump.  And Lisa and Dan confirmed the nomination.  Got that?  An adulteress was just sent to the Vatican as America's ambassador.  Tell me again about Republican 'values'.  Every vote for Trump enabled a pervert.   And you say Republican self-styled 'christians' aren't hypocrites?  Tell me another Republican lie.,?
2663,You sound like a 2 year old in a school yard.  What are waiting for?   $het for hair already threatened us.  If we really that tough  N Korea would already be a parking lot.  This is nothing more than Trumo trying to decoy all of us away from the Russian scandal.  Don't take your eye off the ball.  Trump is knee deep in Kim Chee at home.  Never mind picking on some third world idiot.  Deply Rodman And get it over with.,?
2664,Interesting you say that. During one of Anchorage's recent snow events I flew from Seattle. I knew it had dumped a foot of snow in Anchorage and I was a little worried there might be issues at the airport because of it. However  I was happy when we landed early  and in fact the snow was still coming down hard and visibility was poor as we landed. The airline and airport seemed to act as if it were just another day (which is was). Amazing how efficiently Anchorage airport handles this. Now that was the easy part as it turned out... real problem was out on the roads  looked like a demolition derby on the Glenn...,?
2665,PLEASE JUST LET THEM DIE   THERE IS NO HOPE FOR THEM,?
2666,Yes  we must repent  or the Blessed Mother will rain fire and brimstone upon us  in the God's Mercy!,?
2667,Good for you but it would seem you miss read the piece as it wasn't about students being on the board but rather having the right to vote for board members which to me is like public service union reps sitting across from people they put in office negotiating a raise.  I also have to stand by my implied assertion that faculty could easily influence students to vote their way.,?
2668,My insurance no longer lists OPA as a preferred provider. Because of this I will no longer be using any of their services. This could possibly result in trips outside for treatment...depending on services provided by those outside of the OPA group. Too bad  as this will be a huge inconvenience for my family and too bad for OPA as they are losing a good customer. I believe this issue of health care costs in Alaska will be the determining factor for my choice of retirement States.,?
2669,Never going to happen. Trump doesn't want it  his pick for Interior secretary doesn't want it and neither does the majority of the American public.,?

2672," Nearly half of your nation voted for Donald Trump and you arrogantly dismiss them as gullible."  They voted for a sexist  racist  lying demagogue and the are supposed to be proud of it?,?
2673,I am not sure that the single life--is a vocation--because a person who is single can give it up at any time.  I also do not believe single people would define themselves that way.    Remember---a calling from God does not necessarily have to be a vocation.  As I said all vocations are callings from God  but not all callings from God are vocations.,?
2674,The lying pig  at it again. This man obviously has psychiatric issues. When will Republicans do their job?,?
2675,Trump's an embarrassment to our nation's beloved White House.  Trump has no business bringing up Katrina and attempting to make a stupid comparison.  What?  Is Trump disappointed that more brown skin Puerto Ricans didn't die?  Trump couldn't even hold still while the mayor tried to speak to him.  What a fricking idiot.  Johnny Depp rocks.,?
2676,Just because O'Leary is abrasive and blunt doesn't mean he's anything like Trump.  He would still be owned by his donors  and I can see him being someone who would open to floodgates for mass immigration because it would be "good for the economy".    Remember  the US election was about national sovereignty vs. globalism  which is where a lot of the support for Trump came from.  Without some strong evidence to the contrary I have to assume that O'Leary is a staunch globalist based on his worship of profit above all.,?

2681,The new civil comments seems like a good thing at first glance  but it allows all the idiots to spew forth as long as they spew respectfully. Maybe there should be a minimum IQ score to be allowed to comment.,?
2682,SB 21 exacerbated the budget crisis. It modified the oil tax credit scheme  which is why we are paying out more in tax credits  than we are taking in production taxes.,?
2683,in regards to thd cause of high housing costs I wrote this awhile ago and it stands up well. I have since done further research and found that our home prices are not just the result of out of state demand pushing up prices but are directly related to growing unequal wealth distribution. Stay tuned I plan on discussing this issue  our government  taxes  and the changes in the structure of our economy that has led to this. http://www.civilbeat.org/2014/05/22019-why-the-prices-of-homes-and-everything-else-are-high-in-honolulu/,?

2686,SJW brain washing starts early.,?
2687,Having the Electoral College makes sure all the states have a say.  Yes Clinton leads by about 2.3 million votes nationally.  She leads by 3.4 million votes in California alone  roughly 7.3 million to 3.9 million (and the vote total in CA accounts for almost 9% of the national vote total).  Take away California and Trump won the popular vote.  That is the reason for the Electoral College.  If 38 states want to ratify an amendment to the Constitution to get rid of the Electoral College  so be it.  But then we wouldn't be the United States of America anymore. We would just be regions defined by beliefs and values  with the middle and the southern parts of the country as one large region separating the West Coast and Northeast regions.  We wouldn't need a Senate to represent the states anymore and states could be abolished and just be admin departments for the central government.  Careful what you wish for  it would be chaos with 10 or so candidates each receiving around 10% of the vote.,?
2688,By far the best article I have read related to Charlottesville.  This moron Cantwell deserves every bit of misfortunate that comes his way.,?

2690,Ummmm  in light of recent events  the struggle is still very real for the Queer community ESPECIALLY Queer folks of color and trans women of color. Keeping our spaces safe from assholes like you who don't think safety is a priority for queer people must definitely be written about.  Please sit down and shut the fuck up.,?
2691,"....If more tax-policy changes are made that hurt the industry  investment levels won't increase when oil prices rise  said Moriarty.

Does Karen know what restraint of trade means?   Is she seriously threatening us on behalf of her handlers that if they have to pay a minimum production/severance tax to the owners  the people of Alaska  that they will leave this  or deny others access to it thereby restraining trade?  http://www.utpb.edu/images/default-source/utpb-images/ceed/images/permian-basin-oil-graphs-etc/pbreservescomparison.jpg?sfvrsn=2   We have "the rocks"..and we will be fools to continue to give it away- production tax free   let alone SUBSIDIZED with 700 million (more if the price goes up!!) a year as far ahead as we can see  thanks to SB21`s "loss carry forwards".,?
2692,The media doesn't have to do anything except roll the cameras. There is no need for biased journalism. Trump is more than capable (and proves this every time he opens his mouth and posts a Tweet) of demonstrating that he is unfit to run a country. He is a poor speaker; he loses his temper; he whines and complains;  he has no diplomacy skills; and he has absolutely no understanding of politics. If Trump is really interested in making America great again  then he really should step aside and let someone who knows how to run a country take his place.,?
2693,Representative Wilson's suggested amendments to the budget directly correlated to their 2016 allocations.  Most of them had been raised in 2017 and were double-downed by the Coalition.  Do not be confused by Demot Cole's misdirection.  This Coalition is the Governor's toady and they are working with him to empty the Earnings Reserve and reduce the amount that goes into it (HB 57 Section 7  SB70 Sec. 7 and SB 26). In HB 57 it caps the PFD at $1 000 and sends the remainder to appropriations (government  the Alaska Capital Fund or the General Fund  all mean the same thing).  The Governor has also proposed redirecting money from actual Permanent Fund revenue streams from mineral resources (the source of the fund) directly into the Alaska Capital Fund.,?

2699,Let Darwinism take its course - so that the least stupid shall inherit the earth. It's all about self control  which most obese people lack - it's way too convenient to blame it on some (non-existent) genetic imbalance. Take responsibility for yourself and the garbage you chose to shovel into your mouth. Too lazy to read the labels? Refuse to educate yourself about the effects of White Poison on the body? Overly gullible and believe the corporate marketing hype that tries to sell you cr*p every 30 seconds? Can't haul your carcass off of the couch and actually MOVE? You're on your own - good luck.,?
2700,At last! Hallelujah!!  Too late to keep those hundred of millions the Babbitts flushed down the toilet  the lodge and homes destroyed  but hopefully it will be the end of this stupid bridge project  forever.  "KABATA is an arm of the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities. Five staffers including Dougherty will move to the agency's regional headquarters in Anchorage."  Anyone dense enough to waste years on this project deserves a spot in the unemployment line.   I'm glad to see the dam go as well. Terribly bad idea to put it in such a geologically unstable area.  Mark Neuman proves once again he is a complete idiot. In Big Lake  unfortunately  that's a prerequisite for reelection.,?

2709,"So here's the deal. North Korea today held a parade in honor of Kim Jong Un's grandfather. During this celebration they where to honor the ledership  and show off their military might  which would end with a nuclear testing of their strongest bombs. This testing is against international sanctions they have been put under. So Trump sends a fleet of ships to North Korea with the message of: "Do anything stupid  and we will level you to the ground."  The liberals lose their minds. They said Trump will cause world War 3! It's all over the news. Guess what happens?.... nothing. Kim Jong Un backed off the bomb testing at the last second. Moral of the story  when you act like you have guts  you draw respect.

2714,Recently the Supreme Court declined to hear a case on a broad assault weapons and high capacity magazine ban  which lets the bans stand.  The ruling basically said that assault weapons ARE protected by the Second Amendment  but that since it's in the government's best interest to ban them  the ban is legal.  Can anyone say infringe?  Yeah  you say  boo hoo  the "Second Amendment believers" lost.  No. We all lost.  This case sets precedent and will be used to further ban Constitutionally guaranteed rights.  This decision says that the government can ban ANY Constitutional right as long as the government determines it's in the governments best interests.  Freedom of Speech? Assembly? Due Process?  They are all at risk.  Think about the 2013 NDAA authorizing the government to put American Citizens in secret prisons for life without charges  without trial.  One day you just disappear and are never heard from again.  Well  it's in the government's best interests.  Think about it. WAKE UP.,?
2715,tRump  "all by myself." he must still be in LaLa land. along with the private.,?
2716,And they are of the chosen gender  my boys will be lesser Canadians  blatantly discriminated against for being white males in this Trudeau day and age.,?
2717,Il Duce Trump just brought the entire Republican party out of its closet entitled "conservative" to replace the reality of its "fascism".  Trump is the poster child for the real Republican party found in every closed gathering in the back rooms of America.  All of the governing proposals and intents since the 1930s have been to establish a Fascist State.  The Corporate ancestors of the same era  especially arms manufacturers  jumped into bed with Hitler and Mussolini for the entire war prior to Dec. 7  1941 when they all were required to become U.S. patriots or die.  They took up the fascist banner after the war to reestablish the same in this nation  and succeeded in many ways.  Now  their nominee opens up the closet to show the true nature of the Republican party from stem to stern.  Shannyn expressed it perfectly  Republicans see their mirror image exposed for all to see.,?
2718,Lol... Of course. I shall defer to your personal knowledge of me in this case.,?
2719,With friends like that who needs enemies? The devilish White man has a propensity for violence and bloodshed. Without violence and genocidal murder there would be no United Snakes of AmeriKKKa.,?
2720,LOL...not at all.  I just find it funny anyone thinks Trump is some guy of integrity.  I don't need his tax return to tell me any different; the guy's a scum.,?
2721,Excellent point.  Civil comments...a Portland company...a city not known for tolerating conservatives,?
2722,Or you could pull your panties out of the crack of your butt.. man-up and respect their right to free speech.. just as the blm and antifa claim.. or are you myopic?,?
2723,The republicans are whores  they will destroy the future to satisfy the greed and avarice of their corporate and exploitive supporters at the expense of anyone else. They are delusional  short sighted selfish dimwits.,?
2724,If these people really cared about veterans or patriotism  Donald Trump would not be in the Whitehouse right now.  At this point they'd follow that malevolent pumpkin over the side of a cliff  and so as long as he is tweeting about it they will carry on like they give a damn and not for one second longer.,?
2725,Yes  your comment was judgmental.,?
2726,No good deed goes unpunished. Yet the police do nothing about the idiots with rolling carts and signs peddling their services from the streets of Waikiki or pan handlers at intersections.,?
2727,That tumor can't work quick enough. He is hell bent to destroy Trump like some spoiled brat. You are a loser McCain..... you always have been......one of the worst pilots during the Vietnam era  and the worst phony Conservatives the last 30 years. Represents the state with the worst illegal invasion and dies nothing to stop it.,?
2728,Pitino bought hookers for his recruits at Louisville. You think the sanctions were bad this time? Imagine what the NCAA would do to a small school doing the kind of crap the Pitino seems to regularly pull at whatever school he's coaching at the time.,?
2729,For fucks sake man they aren't left they aren't right and they aren't centrists. They are corrupt  through "legal" bribery".  Criminals without the conviction. ALL of our media is owned by just a few people and they vote money  not republican and not democrat. They keep us divided by getting us to focus on stupid fucking social issues  while they attach manacles to our children.,?
2730,Perhaps you liberal Dimm's wanted them to fly first class...  DEPORT THEM ALL!,?
2731,Sorry Piper  for the past several years the GOP has controlled the Congress  The State houses  and the Supreme Court. Now you know the truth about why we are screwed up. Quit whining and man up.,?
2732,The stupid man  you mean ?  Trump is a Wall Street Billionaire who appointed the CEO of Mobil Exxon as US Secretary of State.  He is the most establishment US President that we have ever seen in our lifetimes.  His brainless  anti-democratic sheep seem to have no qualms that he lost the popular vote in 2016  and even needed Vladimir Putin's help in doing so.  If the US was a real democracy  the 2016 US election would be declared null and void.  The US is an oligarchy  however.,?

2736,Just another Breeder. I'd be much more impressed with an effort to find 3000 shelter dogs homes  instead of formulating a new "trendy" breed...pretty much just to make money. Any mention of what happens to her puppies that don't foster the improvement of her idealized breed?,?

2739,Use barbless hooks.    I always find it disappointing when an experienced (old) fishermen  who has done it for sport and business their whole lives  comes out and says "You know  I've done this for years  but I don't think you should do it anymore because it's just not good for the fish."    "Don't teach your kids or let them enjoy the feeling of safely catching  landing and releasing fish  because I've done plenty of that and now I don't think you should because it's mean to the fish.  How about we take a break from comm fishing so that our Kenai Kings can "safely" return "unharmed.",?
2740,Her attitude is typical of Liberals.  They believe that their way is the right way and that all Canadians should think and act like them  much like any communist government.  The difference is that we have an opportunity to rid ourselves of these condescending  corrupt fools.,?
2741,Such BS dribble.... Trump is our voice  not our master!!!  Your problem is not with Trump  it is with us! Those that were/are protesting the USA Flag disrespect us and do not deserve our support! Trump made us do it... is garbage. 32 players made a BAD choice... apologize or stand up for your convictions  but don't act like a weasel!  If you want to protest... take off the uniform and stand on your own front porch and talk until they stop listening. Don't use the stadium that we paid for or the Broncos organization as a stolen platform for your politics! To disrespect our flag was unforgettable & unforgivable!,?
2742,and THIS is the reason that your gal hillary Lost.  The fact that you view 1/2 of Americans as skunks.....or maybe just call us all Deplorables......and would love to eliminate us from your world speaks all anyone needs to know about you mr crum.  Thankyou for showing us your intolerance so we know for sure we are not welcome into your world.   Pathetic,?

2746,Canada has expressed concern over armoured-vehicle use  well that will work . This follows on the heels of Trudeau asking those crossing our borders illegally to respect the rules. It's one thing to have a PM who runs around the globe spouting greeting card bromides and new age philosophy  it's quite another when it appears that cabinet have bought into this rubbish.,?
2747,A longer article says the owners claim that they need the six loud dogs for their 3.4 acre farm. Imagine how many mastifs a full-size farm must need!,?
2748,the democrats are insane as are the 14 republicans that voted with them..,?
2749,Republican “Leadership” caused the problem. Billions in welfare and tax breaks to the most profitable corporations on earth. $588.2 million already spent studying the Knik Arm Bridge  Juneau Road  Susitna-Watana Dam  and Ambler Road. Who knows how much lost on the LIO. $263 million that the Republican “Leadership” refused to “clawback” from these projects that has not yet been spent  and could be spent on actual asphalt  i.e. needed safety and capacity projects. Republican “Leadership” decimating scholarships  schools and university programs that actually INVEST in our most important resource  Alaska’s kids. Time to elect some real leaders who will work for Alaska and Alaskans  not their Corporate puppeteers  and special interests.,?
2750,Another out of touch  arrogant elitist actor who thinks that playing a business man on TV makes him qualified to run a country! SO SAD!  Even Justin Bieber would make a better leader than O'leary  and has a lot more business sense as well.  O'leary?  Oh weary old fool!,?
2751,"People are addicted to their meat and dairy and they will ignore just about anything to keep eating it.:  Darn those people with their personal preferences!

2752,RD is another who reads "You shall love your neighbor as yourself  unless the neighbor is gay. That neighbor you shall loathe  fear and reject."  He is also of the "gay sex is icky" brigade.,?
2753,Has that happened? Most Muslims believe gays should be killed and young girls get their genitals sliced out. But let's stay focused on eco-terrorism.  Let's just sit around and wait for more spikes go  into logs until someone gets killed. Kind of like Orlando.  Good plan.,?
2754,There will always be incredibly ignorant and selfish people who believe that a powdered form of an endangered species will fix their infirmity. Once these ignorant idiots die off  hopefully the fake medicinal practices attached will die a quick death.,?

2756,The Ontario College of Teachers is a JOKE!!! I have absolutely no respect for them  and I have 3 kids.  Tells you a lot doesn't it.   I personally know someone who's daughter in now in a wheel Chair because they were vaccinated (The Papilloma Virus...vaccination).    My daughter will never get that VACINE.  We will take the risk  He has a right o give his opinion  as long a he does not force it on them.  This idea that just because you are not a Dr. or a Nurse  you are not qualified to give an opinion is a JOKE!!  We re all entitled to our opinions because we have had different experiences.  The Ontario College of Teachers should be ashamed of themselves!!,?

2763,It's sadly true to form for the PC party to oppose Tory's modest user-pay proposal for the Gardiner and DVP without offering any credible alternative.  Mr. Brown's predecessor from the Niagara region was a Ford Nation cars and subways man  against all expert advice.  Now we have another rural PC party leader  weighing in on Toronto's mobility mess.  I get the political calculus: add voters from 905 and the kind of 416 people who support Mammoliti to the bedrock rural base  and the PC's have themselves a government to play with.  But the actual policy stinks.  GTA transportation planning has been dominated by suburban populists for so long that we are now approaching a mobility crisis in our region.  By  opposing Tory's baby step on tolls  Brown has signalled that the Wynne government - with all its many faults - is the only credible choice for any voters who care about the quality of life in the GTA.,?
2764,WOW  what a bunch of bonehead comments. either know whats going on  or just choose to shut up. its pretty simple.,?
2765,I see the problem  you are not good at math.  If your taxes are $1 600 and would drop to $1500 but a measure  passes to keep them at $1 600 then they did not go up.  They stayed the same.  You should look into a senior deferral for your property taxes.,?
2766,Major fear mongering. Seems like an article written to justify the liberals BS climate change strategies. Canada is a tiny fraction in the worlds contributor to "emissions" and global "Carbon" output. The liberals are poised to spend ridiculous amounts of money In an effort to improve Canada's image to the world while doing very little in the grand scheme of things world wide for Climate change. At the expense of its citizens. What a joke. Climate change is naturally occurring! One volcanic eruption trumps all world output of Carbon. Liberals and green peace believers are saying Let's write more articles to make it seem like a carbon tax is needed  and lets attack and blame energy sector before we have feasible alternatives for heating and powering our homes. In the mean time lets buy our oil products from countries that don't come close to producing oil and gas nearly as environmentally ethical as Canada does  oh and Alberta's equalization payments are dirty oil money right?,?

2768,Whatever one may think of he movie as a work of cinematic art doesn't change the fact that millions of Ukrainians were starved as a result of deliberate Soviet policy and the world needs to be to told this story over and over again so that they understand what a massive crime against humanity was perpetrated by the Kremlin then and continues to be denied by the Kremlin now.,?
2769,Medical research is a wholly different subject.  This subject is health insurance. Single payer has been proven to be the nest solution. You conservatives  don't want it for purely ideological reasons. That you want a vastly more expensive system that leaves millions uncovered shows that your ideology is crap.,?
2770,Yes  seeing each other's face is part of communications  but it's not compulsory  nor should it be. Like most things in our society  it's a matter of freedom of choice. We manage to communicate just fine sitting beside each other   or in the dark. This compulsory 'must see the other person's face' thing is sheer bullshit  and an excuse for bigots and misogynists to support the oppression of a small group of Muslim women.,?

2776,Man has always had license to make any claim supported by reality or not.  Whether or not a god exists would not change that ability one  bit.   But lets look at Epicurus false logic.  God being willing to prevent evil but not able to prevent evil would indeed make that god not omnipotent. God being able to prevent evil but not willing to prevent evil does not necessarily make god malevolent.  Nor does willing and able have anything to do with the question then whence comes evil If not capable and unwilling then he would indeed not be called god.    The problem is not in the logic related to the first and last statements but in the middle two statements.  A parent could solve every problem a child would ever face but a wise parent does not solve every problem for their child.  A parent could also be able to and willing to solve every problem for their child but still CHOOSE not to for the same reason.  There are some things a child (or person) must do on their own. Free will.,?

2778,Incredible amount of hatred for fellow Americans that seeps  oozes  leaks and bubbles out of people like you. You demand your rights to free speech and defend the “opinions” of like thinkers  and then take the predictable liberal high ground to bescumber those that disagree with your myopic  one dimensional view of the world.   If you don't watch Fox News  then how have you come to the conclusion that it's not news and idiotic propaganda that perpetrates lies? By listening and believing the other lying  disingenuous  sanctimonious  pietistic  priggish  hypocritical clowns on MSNBC?   I don’t watch Fox News because they’re a major donor to the Clinton Foundation.   And BTW  liking your own posts is like high fiving yourself in the mirror.,?

"I am not going to entertain any idea to write an executive order and take unilateral action " he said.  That's a Governor who respects the Balance of Power.  State Sen.

Try the following  Evan: Google photographs (not drawings or illustrations) of snowflakes  especially magnified photographs of snowflakes. Did you know that no snowflake is alike? Look at their beauty  but especially note their amazing symmetry  design  and construct. What are your thoughts about God when you see a snowflake? And...I would want a reason-created device and prayer if I was experiencing an emergency. Did you know that those devices were revealed to man by God? Oh  one more thing...the arrogance thing is just really a Christian's sheer confidence that God exists and is in control. We become eager to tell others about what we have found  so they can have it too. We tend to think we can make someone believe in God  when really a person has to choose to accept the truth when they are ready. Humans are pretty lucky...the only way to permanently anger God is to completely deny His existence.,?
2816,First  the protests were fabricated by Soros aligned groups. Look at the Gorsuch protest. It's "fill in the blank" hysteria.  Trump  by deferring to his secretaries and advisors  is letting those closer to the frontline on terrorism to make the calls which they believe will be in our national interest.  As for the UN  it is a cesspool of anti Israel thuggery. It is a YUGE waste of our money. Let it occupy some other country's prime real estate. Our foreign aid should only go to countries which wish to be our allies. No aid should go to countries with dictators who will use that money to secure their own power & control.  If you recall 8 years ago  Glenn Beck was describing the Obama Admin. as creating havoc up & down  inside & out  above & below. Trump is doing the same thing  but not toward securing more power to himself. He is putting the Left into a tizzy  AND the general population will begin to tune them out. They are offended by everything he does.  Judge him on what he DOES.,?

Yet when there is an article void of facts which might contradict your arguments  you just pretend they do not exist. In this case you make a bunch of ASSUMPTIONS...with silly comments referencing "sperm donors" and wondering what this says about the woman in the first place. Even suggesting a visit to Planned Parenthood. Maybe she was divorced...maybe her husband of the first two children left her....or died...you have no clue but that does not stop you from ripping her to shreds. Maybe you should try cleaning up your posts before worrying about Eugene. Incredible.,?
2832,"... just because someone agrees with the temporary immigration ban does not make them racist." Earl:XratEd  Thank you for the correction. You are right.  The appropriate term would be "religious bigots."  And  of course  the always applicable "morons.",?
2833,The only thing this twit can do is produce headlines.  He's basically the drunk idiot in the corner hurling threats  all while barely able to stand. So what "Trump say..."?  "Trump says..." is entertainment  at best.,?
2834,It sounds fun laser pointing's called war games Mmmmmmmm,?
2835,This precedes Trump so your argument is invalid.  Also  it wasn't just one guy. Do you even watch football?  And if it's not such a big deal why don't they just stand the hell up instead of bringing politics into an arena it doesn't belong in? Just play f**king football.,?
2836,Cue the Trumpties for the normal dose of ignorant fallacies.,?
2837,Somebody has to say it. Did you fall off the idiot train again?,?
2838,SA:  You are only partially right  some Alaskans would gladly have other Alaskans pay an income tax so that some Alaskans could keep their PFD.,?
2839,Save the planet from nuclear holocaust by starting one? ...idiot.,?
2840,Those in jail can only victimize those already in jail for other crimes.  That works for me.,?
2841,Trump should have a couple felonies too along with the Clintons but ya.. the rich and powerful get away with rape and murder.,?
2842,Excellent decision. Corporations lying to the public in those "No Sales Tax" ads leading up to the November elections will now be countered by common sense.,?
2843,Uh  in order to gerrymander  you first have to win control of the legislature.  The Democrats would be doing it  too  if they could win a damned election.  Voter suppression  my butt.  You can't do much of anything in this country  including apply for welfare  if you don't have ID.,?
2844,You Get What You Give:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL7-CKirWZE,?
2845,The right-wing misogynists on here have proven the writer correct.  There are still many cowardly men in Canada who fear strong women.  Pathetic.,?
2846,It's time to put Trump and Jung in the ring. It sounds like both are hyping a wrestling match.,?
2847,An Alaskan  Pubic is a Trump Bizarro World Clown  put here to try and distract us from Putrumpski as he rampages across America  goring freedom  individual rights and the US Constitution. You know  like a rodeo clown.,?
2848,take his gun away and pee test him.,?
2849,psssst... if you lie on your PFD  you are cheating Alaska.  Talk is cheap Old Man Brown  but for you it is all a lie.,?
2850,Trump is a buffoon. And a traitor. He has absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever. He's disgusting.,?
2851,Silly comment there  Ronda.,?
2852,so there will be no police presence at the parade.  hmmm  what will be the repercussions if the police are needed??  someone gets shot?  someone gets assaulted?  yet the police won't be there.  I wonder who will be the first one crying ...,?
2853,Keep going Lou. The rebuild is over  the roster tweaking starts now...Why wouldn't Tavares want to come here now? Lupul comes off the books and JVR is a UFA next year. They still have cap space for Tavares to come here next year or via a trade  especially if they dump Kadri or they let Bozak walk - I would keep Bozak as the #3 (at the right price) if Tavares is a possibility.,?
2854,I find it absolutely hypocritical that Gov insists on labelling Cannabis as a DRUG! and how DANGEROUS ! IT IS.. when it has been studied to the point of no return ..and there has been little if ANY !! evidence to back that B.S. up..!!  Throwing $36.4 Million on top of the $9.6  totalling $43 million dollars to deter children from indulging.. really?? Jeezuz Justin..!! how stupid do you federal welfare rats think Kid's are these sunny daze..?? I can well imagine which Lobby groups are pokin you in the ribs to push this hype..! Can you say.. Big Pharma ?? or maybe Rock City Tobacco Company..!! You appear to be rather biased when you claim that pot is a Drug..!! but Alcohol is NOT..!! Booze Kills !! Pot heals !! Do some real research...and get educated !! it's fairly cheap to get the fact's except of course unless you are a student.. then you will pay for learning how screwed up society actually is not to mention Corrupt.,?
2855,Fire this twit!,?
2856," “No. I am critical of your client for sticking his hand under my skirt and grabbing my bare ass.”  No panties  eh  Taylor. Did you really appear dressed like that in front of your mother?,?
2857,I hope you kicked him in the knards for asking that...LOL...,?
2858,Not sure why you're getting all triggered by me  I'm just going by what their president and Congressional zealot Democrats supporters are claiming.,?
2859,Stop whining  Art.  You've enjoyed a Cadillac plan.  Most Alaskans would love to have what you've had.  Not to mention the rest of your very generous Tier one benefits.,?
2860,"Why don’t we just close the loophole and send them back to the US?"  America isn't going to take them back. Why should it? If they were in America legally they wouldn't be leaving  in spite of whatever lies the gullible fools on the left believe about their destination always having been Canada.,?
2861,"Kalil says the investigation could take three to six months."  Sounds like the commission is a bit of a make work project.  The event probably took less than 2 hours  how long does it take to review the video or audio and suggest  yes  fellow made an error  don't do such a stupid thing next time?,?
2862,Time for Donald and Bibi to issue statements of condolence to Iran.,?
2863,Yeah  I wouldn't open carry if you paid me to in this state. To many wackos like Ward will get you killed by calling the police.,?
2864,Aussies really are prejudiced. Real bastardos. They hate the Indians  Aborigines  blacks  and Asians. Don't even try to talk to them. Had lots of fun yelling back at them. So many sex perverts that they passed a law forbidding pedophiles from leaving Australia. More Aussie tourists die in Thailand than any other destination. Why?,?
2865,Isnt that special,?
2866,Good day for a liberal if you can't find a victim or an oppressor  become a victim yourself. At least in your own eyes. Because its 2016 and Canada is back.,?
2867,Thanks God this scumbag was not elected President.He would had been a white Obama,?
2868,"It’s impossible for someone to give more than $1 500 per year to a federal party."  The scary thing about our new photogenic PM is that he doesn't actually know anything.  Further  none of his advisers are even capable of googling 'Barry Sherman and Joe Volpe' before letting him speak.  He really is an empty suit.,?
2869,Go away traitor.  Your daddy can't save you from your own stupid ego.  You are a disgrace to the USA.,?
2870,FBI investigations which never resulted in prosecution  concerning independent allegations of subordinates (middle management at Spring Creek) soliciting bribes from vendors  over the phone  which Schmidt failed to take corrective action on. Plaintiffs declined to file charges  as they were  by then  "Out of the trade.". Names  dates  actions available at FBI office in Anchorage. Open that can of worms. I dare anyone!,?
2871,Just for you  Mr Fish.,?
2872,Keep him locked up as long as possible. Due to his medical condition  he may not serve any prison time after conviction.  This is one dangerous guy.,?
2873,now he will be someone's GF in Halawa and will get to experience life on the other side.  He can leave and he can't hide in the big house.  just hope our pathetic judges put this loser away.,?
2874,Why should we have to pay to help idiots use illegal dope. Let them die. That or bring in Durete. He has what it takes to stop this crap.,?
2875,Richard Johnson Esq - you LIKE your own comment again! Hahaha!  Good try in vilifying the messenger. You fail.  Good luck in your silly efforts to do damage control for a very bad Mayor like Caldwell.,?
2876,Just a question.  I've heard of children with names on the non-fly list being held up in getting a boarding pass but these cases were always resolved and they continued on their way.  Are there any significant number of instances where children were not permitted to fly?  There is no doubt a solution but keep in mind that any Canadian specific no-fly list isn't going to fly :>) if the country of landing refuses entry. This isn't just a Canadian decision.,?
2877,"Woman apologizes to Ted Cruz at town hall for calling him a coward online"  I'm from Texas  Cruz IS a coward  and a liar  and I'd tell him to his face with no apology whatsoever. He's just another loudmouthed  ideological  political bum making hay off the American people.,?
2878,The  more I think about it  the more I like this idea.  Tie gun ownership to certifiable and strict adherence to tax law.  CONDITION gun ownership in America to a clear record of observing a fundamental aspect of legal citizenship - the timely and proper payment of taxes  along with all the acts that accompany that LEGAL duty.  In fact  enact a waiting period that INCLUDES ANY UNRESOLVED TAX AUDIT PERIOD (a waiting period which could be ended quickly and simply simply by paying the amount the taxing authority has assessed pre-audit).  Why should anyone who fails to pay taxes be entitled to have a gun.  Isn't the failure to pay taxes a character flaw  and evidence of inability to act legally  that should preclude a person from having a deadly weapon?  The additional benefit would obviously be better tax collection experience.  Maybe this would be a way to enlist gun enthusiasts in the other over-arching interest they seem to have in curbing the National Debt?,?
2879,He doesn't know anything about the issue and his proposal is stupid  therefore it is mindless  ignorant garbage. It is also poisonous. I expect people to actually study an issue before commenting. If they do not  and most do not  their opinions are worthless. Most of the activists in Eugene who are seriously working on this issue will not write for the RG  because it publishes so much crap. We communicate through other channels.,?
2880,Fascism is not limited to right-wing idiots. And communism is not currently burning colleges and cities.,?
2881,Rules are for suckers.,?
2882,Yes  but he does have nice hair!!!,?
2883,You can't really understand U.S. politics without acknowledging that a significant part of the American electorate consists of people who are profoundly bigoted and ignorant. Whether we call them deplorables or hicks or evangelicals  these people should be shamed and marginalized. They are a threat to decent people and to themselves.,?
2884,A rather stupid piece ...,?
2885,Oh Dispatch  you right wing media elitist rag.  The only thing you're good for is fishwrap and cage liner.  FAKE NEWS!  (Removes tongue from cheek),?
2886,FUCK YOU.   I know this will be cut  but as a combat vet in nam  I had to say it.  Alleged Service.  Rot in hell couch potato draft dodger or coward.,?
2887,CNN and BBC is rejected  yet FOX and Brietbart are permitted?!   LOL   Trump is such a coward.,?
2888,Like the Clinton foundation  check all these foundations started by Liberals Loaded with Chinese  Iranian  Syrian millions I bet No wonder they want to open the borders wide open  these politicians are on the take I bet,?
2889,Amy  one doesn't make amends to expand their compassion or assuage their own guilt. It's not about them. It should be about the person the hurt.,?
2890,hey idiot no trump supporters started any violence to shut anyone up you idiot  they were standing up for thier right to hear trump speak over the bs left wingers at rallies to try and stop it.. and trump people dont start fights  they finish them once attacked by the left wing goons..  as for the rest  wow you cant win an argument on the story so now you try and twist policy that has been in the usa for decades as some hate? man you leftards really have to go far when you cant win a debate,?
2891,Yup! Your point?,?
2892,Helen Zille is a complete scum and a big-time racist to begin with. The biggest housing scam of our nation had previously happened directly under her supervision. Now marikana housing scam. Shame on you Helen and DA.,?
2893,The previous 5-6 000 protesters will return with everyone including their uncles.,?
2894,Isn't there some parallel universe where Trump can be elected president of the nation of white supremacists who support him? Of course it would only be fun if those of us here in this universe could watch how things went with him as president but seriously  could there be any funnier spectacle? It's nice to imagine though that there is some parallel universe where ignorant white supremacists are living with the ramifications of a Trump presidency. Couldn't we just let Trump be president of some  state like Oklahoma for shits and giggles?,?
2895,Ya we need this woman like we need cancer.  Another out of touch fool who thinks that the solution is hate.,?
2896,Our own leader should also be under investigation for the ill advised sale of Norsat to China.  So  did Hytera only cough up the $1500 access fee  or was it much more generous contribution to the Trudeau Foundation?,?
2897,The expressions on Huckabee Sanders face as she contorts the truth to defend the Idiot-in-Chief are priceless.,?
2898,"Looks like the case is unraveling."  That was the claim being made a couple of months ago. Maybe it's true...but  maybe it's not.  The only way to get to the truth is by continuing the investigation.  Keep watching  friends  keep watching.,?
2899,Most of these comments seem to support the notion that many Alaskans are financially well off.   "It's good to be the King." -Mel Brooks,?
2900,LOL - all talk  no action.  Too funny.  Paranoia makes people do stupid things.,?
2901,Wente  let me ask you a question. If a space ship full of aliens lands in a city and buys up all the homes with tons of gold and diamonds from their planet (a gold rich planet) and makes all the residents homeless  what would you say then?  That is exactly what is happening in Toronto except in this case it is not aliens but rather foreigners from Asia.,?
2902,If you just heard the audio you would think N. Korea or any other country run by a mentally ill despot.,?
2903,You say "But when that's taken to the next step and they believe others see them as racists for disliking the protests  they are incensed. "  ITS ONLY TRUMP THAT PEOPLE ARE CALLING RACISTS.  HE IS THE ONE CALLING THEM SOBs WHILE BARELY CRITICIZING NAZIS.  TELL THE TRUTH GOD DAMN IT!,?
2904,Tom jensen u should be ashame...saying Dr.Whites in it for the money......who got an 18 percent raise while your employees are busting there ass getting 1 percent....who's the crook here,?
2905,And here I thought Trump was this great leader and organizer and winner! He can't even manage a campaign and the fools want to make him president?,?
2906,Are these some of those Russian pieces of crap that they seem to be building all over Alaska. People don't buy that poorly built Russian houses. You will regret it down the road. Good luck getting them to fix there slapped together houses to.,?
2907,A disgusting piece of sexist trash.,?
2908,Talk about runaway public spending? I guess the Liberals are counting on the budget balancing itself?,?
2909,All "refugees" that I know  personally  were all  economic immigrants  with a fake refugee story(my own country of origin).  One can make their own conclusion on how easy it s to work the system( at least 5-10 years back).  As for  merit based immigration - you can fake a lot of 'experience' or a 'refugee story' when coming from some countries.,?
2910,I've read enough to know that dull-minded foot soldiers of the alt-right have been brainwashed to falsely equate feminism with an attempt to exterminate men and anti-racism with an attempt to exterminate whites when in fact  they are seeking to eliminate white/male privilege.  Since the leaders of the alt-right can't openly argue against human rights  they create the straw man of an existential threat instead.  Not to say there aren't also idiots on the left -- just that none of them are arguing for the extermination of white men.,?
2911,He's a murderer. He's a murderer!!! He's a MURDERER!!!!!,?
2912,There is no place for a bunch of Ku-Ku-Klowns in Canada. In the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century an English three Canadians was a member of the white supremacist organization Anglo-Saxon  WASP equivalent to the United States ("White Anglo-Saxon Protestants").  Four members have been Prime Ministers of Canada   Sir John A. Macdonald (father of « Canadian Federation » of 1867 but not « Father of Canada » which is Sir Samuel de Champlain in 1608 )   Sir John Abbott   Sir Mackenzie Bowell (a past « Grand Master » (?))   and John Diefenbaker.   In 1927 the “Orange” movement gave birth to a more intolerant and racist group  the Canadian Ku Klux Klan  which had its deepest roots in small towns in Saskatchewan because of the "yellow peril"  but also because of the blacks...Jews...Catholics... (The “Ku Ku Nest” in the province campaigned against= teaching French + wearing the religious habit + the presence of crucifixes in schools.),?
2913,Why wouldn't it be?,?
2914,Anna MacKinnon is giving Kelly a real challenge as being the most boneheaded of the bunch in the State Senate.,?
2915,Yes  there are.  But use of more labor intensive and less efficient means could substantially increase the cost of housing.  Likely  you would carp about the dramatic cost increases and claim forestry should be more efficient.,?
2916,Unbelivable stupid people out there!  I have been asking for months. How did russia interfere?!  What was done?  And with all the evidence aginst Hilary  why is she not in prison?,?
2917,What a sad article. Imagine being stuck with this woman's brain........arghhhhh.,?
2918,Fake gun  REAL jail.  Duh...,?

2920,Defending Hillary Clinton only makes you look like a complete jackass. That's not even up for debate.,?
2921,Silly rabbit.   That's not where it starts in most cases like this. It starts with an individual breaking the law. Then police are called. It then proceeds to said individual threatening police after they engage him/her. From there it follows basic police procedure.  It's simple really.   Hundreds of people interact with police officers on a daily basis and make good decisions and wake up the next morning. A few don't.,?
2922,Stop talking like you know what actually happened or is going on. You are making yourself look ridiculous.,?
2923,A "cry from the white nationalist gut"? What a complete load of utter horses**t. What the h*ll is wrong with the left that it has to inject race into everything?,?
2924,That's one man's opinion. Mr Turnip is actually his own  and the Republic party's  worst enemy  and he is just getting started. Democrats just need to follow the Enough Rope strategy. There's no mystery about the election defeat: the electorate is as vain as it is stupid  and was again easily led to sabotage its own well being by the usual suspects playing on their resentments and bigotry. Will they wise up? I don't know  but I won't support a party that makes itself more like the Rupuglicans  promiscuous liars and shameless opportunists.,?
2925,Could it be possible that a few of the gold bars might also land in Duterte's pocket in exchange for his con$iderati0n towards a a fellow-albeit deceased-murderer  thief  and tyrant?,?
2926,"...did not carry purses..." Oh whatdya call em instead "handbags"?,?
2927,Of course the top 5% of the U.S. population owns something like 60% of the countries wealth. The bottom 40? Significantly less than one per cent of the total wealth. Seems like it's actually the middle income brackets that aren't pulling their weight  but one can't demonize them -- there are too many of them  and they vote!,?
2928,DC:  motley beat me to the answer  Good Job Motley.    Also  the trouble is not over yet and will probably never be over because the U of Nike is always conducting business that is lets say  "BORDERLINE".    Next lawsuit  up  should be the  physical ASSAULT and arm breaking of a student by U of Nike   football player Darrin Carrington  aka  "THE JOKER".  They have so far swept this under the carpet  WHY?????,?
2929,I hope she fulfills her role as a token well.,?
2930,Muons???  My arse!  I ain't ever seen no "muons."  If you fall for this  you probably believe in global warming.  This is another Chinese hoax aimed at weakening 'murica.  These so-called "scientists" just grabbed onto this to get more funding for more "research" to give them job security.,?
2931,Timbuktu in Africa is more "sustainable" than Hawaii. Will we ever "get real" here??? not until a natural disaster happens to wake everyone up - like not having electricity for more than a day and a half...."Hawaii - the Clueless State" - on hawaiian time. legislators in Hawaii are afraid to DO anything at all - no matter what the issue - just submit a bill and let it "rot in committee" until everyone forgets about it. pathetic.,?
2932,It beats me how the dregs think so highly of themselves - arrogant and useless to say the least. Then again what else would you expect - been like that since day 1,?
2933,The Magnitsky law will cover all countries  not just Russia. Duterte will also feel its effects.,?
2934,Her message is actually a poison arrow with a note attached. It says  "Die  scum!",?
2935,Believe it or not  voting fraud was at less than 1% before Republicans starting fixing the 'problem' that didn't exist. Just to keep minorities from voting.  I'm more worried about the voting machines being rigged. It's happened before. It would also explain Kentucky electing that moron  Bevin  for governor. They're looking into Arkansas for the same thing.,?
2936,It sounds like they both have their ups and downs  as expected. Nobody really knows how anybody​ is playing yet because they haven't played a pre season game. Practice is practice  games are games. As you know  I hardly ever agree with Kiz  but the reporting on the QBs has been horrible. We really won't know anything til game time.  Very True  always hear that about the Bronco O line every year  one year it might actually turn out to be true. That's the way it goes in camp  every year fresh hope. New coaches  new players  new O system have to wait and see what happens before making judgements in August.,?
2937,that rounding up the homeless/mentally ill  people and then determining where they go ...............scary words and ideas  ...sounds like part of the Nazi agenda .. jews  mentally ill  homosexuals  gypsies    et al.  got  pretty raw deal...,?
2938,I do not know about the other islands but Oahu has been a de facto sanctuary city for many years.  It is amazing how incompetent and foolish these guys on the City Council are. The illegals who are here are in violation of the law and should not be supported.  You will not find this kind of stupid thinking in other countries.,?
2939,The city will do what it wants.  The city attorney will litigate Ms. Michael's issue then file a motion for rule 82 attorney fees when the city prevails.  This is why big government doesn't work.,?
2940,To put this in perspective  imagine a 100 million ton rock. Now imagine that rock sliding down a mountain. Pretty crazy  eh? If that's not mentally graspable  imagine two 50 million ton rocks  one balanced on top the other and the top one is wearing a baseball cap and an orange cape. Now imagine them both sliding down a mountain yelling "Who's ya daddy" all the way. Still not getting it? Okay  imagine 1 000 000 one-hundred-ton rocks and they're all at a Phish concert doing whip-its in the parking lot when one of them says  "Hey dudes! Wanna climb that mountain and swish on down it like we're skiing the Matterhorn?" and all the other rocks say  "Duuuude! Let's do it!" And then they do. No? Still nothing? Okay  imagine...........,?
2941,Well there are plenty of concussions in football.,?
2942,Harris also privatized Hydro and restructured it to make that sale. He got the ball rolling. That's the point. If you criticize Wynne for this you must also criticize Harris.,?
2943,Thank you for the good article!,?
2944,"The photo of U.S. President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Theresa May briefly holding hands as they strolled along the White House colonnade a week ago absolutely delighted the Brexiteers."  It must have made Theresa May's (and every other Woman on the planet) skin crawl to have a sex predator hold her hand like that.  I guess in Politics you have to do what you have to do.,?
2945,son you are a bigot and should apologize to c2000,?

2947,Are you that stupid to suggest i am 17years old because i have a 'y' at the end of my name? What a bunch of idiots. I have been commenting on G&M longer than 7 years  but i suppose you can't  really do math anyways and stick to perverted thoughts.,?
2948,NO Surprise to hear there will be a legislative session after the "cooling off period" slogan parroted top on down.  This "cooling off period" should have been a thorough  intelligent and thoughtful deliberation of this Honolulu Rail project and its MULTILPLIER IMPACTS on Oahu  besides the fiscal black hole.  This session will be a moment of truth for the State Legislature. The public will know who is a statesman who can stand for the public good or who is a politician who will be controlled by powerful forces.  sunk cost fallacy noun [ S ] uk ​ us ​ ECONOMICS  MANAGEMENT   "the idea that a company or organization is more likely to continue with a project if they have already invested a lot of money  time  or effort in it  even when continuing is not the best thing to do:  Economists would point out that the sunk cost fallacy is irrational  and could be described as "throwing good money after bad".,?
2949,You like her charade?  She get's no cheers for playing her rubes like fools.  She only came out against the bill after it was already dead.  You want to give her credit for playing you?,?
2950,I hate to say this...but hearing about those kind of contract numbers makes me think about many of the  long term deals around baseball and how few actually work out...We just need to think about the Cargo and Tulo deals to see the shortcomings.   The way to keep the team strong is to continue to draft and develop and if need be  trade a player that is up for renewal for more top level prospects in the off-season and keep the ball rolling to stay relevant. This was one reason I hated to see the team give up its 1st rounder for Desmond as it was short sighted especially for a guy who did not have crazy stats to make it worth it.   If Blackmon can agree to something similar to the Desmond deal  I'd jump on that but those long term deals worth 100's of millions I'd pass.,?
2951,Kudos to those with the foresight to put these young scientists to work on such collaborative efforts and thank you to our young academicians who are dedicating their lives to research and teaching. We need to learn and understand more about earth's species before they vanish.,?
2952,Like Obama was?   Hypocrite.,?
2953,Now we need to start exporting liberals to these third world toilets  with a no returns policy.,?
2954,Well  lookey there. I provide adefinition in good faith  and you come back with even more overt FUD and long disproven talking points.  As to economics  the sustainability and renewables sector is one of the fastest growing and most profitible set of industries worldwide- creating and capable of creating millions of well paid jobs  and yet is ever hampered by useless hacks and right wing ideologues.,?
2955,Fr. Martin is a disgrace and a Homosexualist priest who needs to start attending his local Courage group.  And maybe seek out a NARTH therapist to heal his disordered same-sex attraction.,?
2956,And what advantage was he OBVIOUSLY playing for?  Continued backing and support of White Supremacists.  NO ONE ELSE.  Going forward  support of Trump  a vote for Trump  argument defending Trump  will be judged through the lens of whether someone is a White Supremacist sympathizer.  Like that individual they are supporting  or voting for  or arguing in defense of.  It's how it is.  What's going to be amazing to me is if ANYONE currently a part of Trump's administration  except Bannon  Gorka and Miller  stick around much longer.  Trump has managed to make what appears to be his anti-non-white racism a defining aspect and issue of his Presidency.  It is a measure of just how unsmart he is.  And  the GOP should recognize it as fast as possible.  It is a mistake and uncovering that reveals a lack of intelligence  and arrogance  and a malignant heart that will truly ruin that party unless gotten rid of.   POTUS is a White Supremacist.  That is what people think.  With good reason.  Stupid.,?
2957,If Murkowski were a toady of her party  she would not have denounced Trump.,?
2958,Come again? Say what?,?

2962,Once again... Trump and the gang: Lying liars who lie.,?
2963,John:  I do NOT need to know these types of people  NOR would I EVER have any association with these types of LOSERS.  I read all about them in the News and Police Reports.    Why do a lot of people Public Shame? Because they are SICK and TIRED of these types of LOSERS making their CHILDREN the VICTIMS............  What is your dog in the fight?  You must be a  friend?????  YOU state  criticizing a missing person is  pretty low.  I will tell you what is LOW.  Leaving your 6 year old daughter for 3 weeks while you go see your SEX OFFENDER boyfriend...............,?
2964,Would somebody please think of the children! Kinder Morgan and China are coming to kill them all!,?
2965,I call BS  this is pothead and company  falsifying the books to sound good. The pothead is about to rape Canadians. Kick this bum to the curb.,?
2966,If these guys would read Trump's book the Art of the Deal they would know that this is just negotiating Trump style.  If they dont realize it then they are dumber than we think.,?
2967,In fact I will be happy not to have a secret ballot held so that the people of this country can see through the scum that is called politicians. An open vote will finally show that talk is cheap because in the end we are talking of people who have nothing else to offer besides being freeloaders and ultimately it comes down to the politics of the stomach. They will not vote him out.,?
2968,This is the biggest trashing Sunny Ways and the LPC have ever taken on this forum. A good sign of things to come. If Sunny Ways was smart he would move the liar right out of cabinet immediately but... he won't. This is akin to the Titanic just after it hit the iceberg  it will take a while for them to figure out how bad the damage is.,?
2969,wow are you really that stupid? yes since over those 40 years we had  all there parties in power,?
2970,dumb ass,?
2971,You're an idiot...,?
2972,Well...here is como_estas  the champion deflector  at it again.  Still obsessed with Clinton  eh  como?  Give it up.  Clinton is LONG LONG gone.  In the past.  Let us now focus no the horror that is Trump.,?
2973,Trannies make up like .00000000000000001% of the population so remind me why we should care what happens to these freaks.,?
2974,POTUS would like to pay a visit to the left coast but the Governors and Mayors cannot guarantee his safety.,?
2975,But Republicans suck and he doesn't need them. At least that's what he's been saying.,?
2976,He will be president for as long as he lives.  Certainly he will be president for 8 years if his health  is good.,?
2977,In Canada  despite improved fuel economy and emissions standards in most vehicles  the growing trend of "consumer preference" for SUV's and light trucks has resulted in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from light trucks more than doubling  from 22 Mt  of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent in 1990 to 50 Mt in 2014  which has more than offset reductions in passenger car emissions from 52 Mt in 1990 to 36 Mt in 2014.  While total Canadian GHG emissions have increased at an average annual growth rate of 0.7% between 1990 and 2014  the transportation sector has increased at an average annual rate of 1.1%. In 2014  a record 65% of new vehicle sales were trucks (the "truck" category includes medium to heavy-duty vans  pick-ups  and SUVs). Each litre of gasoline used produces about 2.3 Kg of CO2  the principle GHG linked to climate change. Vehicles emit other contaminants (VOCs  CO and NOx) known to contribute to air pollution and smog   resulting  in thousands of premature deaths around the world.,?
2978,Patrick was the last person on the School Board to approve of wasteful spending.,?
2979,If it was peaceful from the left then  no. However  that's not the case.  They act like children  whining  with temper tantrums. So in turn  I advocate treating them accordingly. Giving them something to cry about.   Also  it's hard to get hit by a car if you stay out of the damn road.,?
2980,Still haven't read anything on ADN concerning the Clinton Global Initiative and the fact its no longer up and running.  Hmm....she didn't get elected and her foreign donors pulled out?  Damn.....if that ain't crooked I don't know what is!  So march on suckers!  Think if we had elected that dirty scum bag in a pink pant suit.  The pussycats on their heads would have been pretty dirty!!,?
2981,No different than the police returning a drunk his or her car.,?
2982,Dollars to donuts he knows that he can't force through the system of his choice so he is deferring a change to proportional representation until after the next election.  To do so before hand would result in the next election resulting in a minority and a loss of power for the government.,?
2983,Trump Applauds Junior's 'Transparency' In Imbecilic Brief Statement  Trump finally commented by releasing a one sentence statement through an off-camera briefing read by Sarah Huckabee Sanders to the press in which he praised his son's "transparency."  Sanders read  "My son is a high-quality person and I applaud his transparency.”  That was it.  Donald Jr. only released the email chain after knowing the NY Times was about to publish them so that's not the definition of being transparent.  That's called "trying to control the narrative" before damaging information is revealed by the press.  Did the White House staff that prepared this imbecilic statement keep a straight face after they wrote it?,?
2984,"Classic textbook racism" says your buddy  Paul Ryan. But he's still going to vote for him. Ryan votes for racist and you will too. We know it hurts  but it's plain stupid to come on this thread and defend the racist tRump.,?
2985,"According to The Times  the breach did not sit well with White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly who  after being contacted by the Times  “privately erupted at Mr. Cobb.” Whether he also erupted at Dowd is not known."  Fred  Fred  Fred  according to the orginal article  McGahn "privately erupted at Mr. Cobb" while Kelly "sharply reprimanded.",?
2986,This guy deserves NOTHING but to rot in jail forever and a  day!,?
2987,:) funny  I thought Francis was smiling; to me Leo looks as if he is taking it all in! Fascinating how each of us sees things (literally and figuratively) so differently.,?
2988,Cadmus: what choice are you talking about? Judge Carlson has never chosen anything peculiar. And  protecting the anonymity of his husband is done to protect him from the same ignorant and hateful people and their actions that interfered so greatly in Judge Carlson's ability to be an effective judge and face re-election by those hateful people.,?
2989,And they're absolutely correct!,?
2990,Wow  Steve Slott! A known industry hack commenting on an ADN article relating to his bread and butter! One wonders what brings your stinking carcass to our doorstep Steve? I see your slime trail leads across the continent! With all the commenting on Internet forums and articles  how do you find the time to practice poor dentistry? Don't answer Steve  just do us a favor and go sniff somebody else's pants  or better yet  suck start a shotgun.,?
2991,I have quit using Amazon. A lot of the stuff is seconds from China with long delivery times and even with the free prime shipping you pay $89 for membership seems to have added the shipping charge into the purchase price. I don't think this model really works as well as the Amazon puts on. I think all the money is being made buying and selling the company stock.,?
2992,Little Potato's platitudes and pleasantries have no effect on Beijing.  They know they are dealing with a child  and he is too childish to realize it.  China doesn't give a damn what Trudeau thinks  and will only use him  as a useful idiot.  They already do.,?
2993,Hillary  your supporters are either ignorant or evil like you.,?
2994,Liberals are like fish . . . a fresh change at first but pretty soon they start to stink.,?
2995,I am eagerly awaiting Marcus McGee's next column on how stock markets shouldn't be regulated  food safety rules should be thrown aside and driving activity should be unlicensed and unregulated ... because  well  government should just get out of the way and let society develop without rules!,?
2996,eric -your opinion is irrelevant.  Aren't you the one who posed for years as the rabid liberal womyn  jjp58???,?
2997,Am I the only one hearing dog whistles when of all the things Senator Gardner cares to name as worthy of attention just now  not a one of them appears to include the US Territory Puerto Rico's plight and just exactly how they got there  in macroeconomic terms. How is that not a profoundly disturbing omission  Senator? Were you in a rush? Did you simply forget about our priorities for our Federal government? Are you even generally cognizant of what is going on in Puerto Rico today?,?
2998,Trump outed Isreal as the source of the compromised intel he gave to Russia as Netanyahu stands next to him. http://media.crooksandliars.com/2017/05/36345.mp4_high.mp4 The look on Netanyahu's face is priceless. Trump is a vacuous and vapid buffoon. And a traitor.,?
2999,It frightens me to know that Junior Buffoon is walking onto the world stage again.  You just know he is going to do or say something stupid (or both).  Go easy on him Donald.,?
3000,WRONG! Healthcare in not an issue. Insurance is. It IS being insurance companies and we are being mandated by government to buy it. Wall street only becomes a problem when they work hand in hand with government.,?
3001,My question is how did General Kelly get the Secret Service to stand aside while he held a gun to Trump's head to keep him from going off his teleprompter remarks?,?
3002,Brian Griffin quoted Mencken: "The common man's a fool".  Peter Griffin is proof.,?
3003,I live in Arlington and we never go to Seattle. All those precious snowflakes and fags. Ugh.,?
3004,On the other hand  if we were to be graded on a curve  ItsMe would help many of us get better grades.,?
3005,Wikileaks said it wasn't the Russians who leaked evidence. It is well known that hardworking people in the CIA and FBI were horrified when Lyin Hillary wasn't charged with treason and all the other things she could have been charged with.  Let alone the billions they took in in that sham charity from countries buying favors..  Any sane person knows it was a inside leak from caring Americans who had had enough of the corruption and did the right thing by leaking this crap.  Look at the emails - they show corruptions right to Obama. The entire Liberal left is corrupt and we have had enough of their awful lies and deceptions.  Look at Trudeau and his fundraising scam.  Lyin Hillary - You lost because you are a scammer  All of you on the left need to get over it.,?
3006,More bullshit  bunch of scammers. Over priced venue.,?
3007,What a bunch of garbage! I have study the history of the Presidents since JFK  and every man had their downfalls when it came to women  the worse was Bill Clinton  not to include our current knucklehead in office Obama  but the spineless News sources cover it up except for On American News (OAN) Newsmax the key is to learn from this  do not trust any Liberal with a microphone! Not to mention that Billy Bush moved up the Liberal chain of stupid reporters (Net worth $9 million USD)  I am more interested in getting this country back on tract which a good business man will do  Donald Thump has my vote here in Alaska not that Witch that has gotten our troop's killed overseas and she could care less. Just like our current Knucklehead. I want somebody who will surround himself with personnel that will advise him on what to do! He already started with Mike Pence  the other House/Senator's  are worried about their but's in this election. Just my concerns in Alaska! Go Thump/Pence  JakInAlaska,?
3008,Both of them are deranged  and one of them is a criminal  married to a rapist.,?
3009,God speed  detective.,?
3010,Some people worry  like the current owner of the existing lodge  environmental impacts from driving piling  just where in Kachemack Bay are there not piling. Hundreds of dock piling have been placed in the last few years  Homer Harbor  Tutka Bay  Halibut Cove and the list continues. Mr McBride constructed and operated a Bear Viewing lodge near McNeil Bay  no lodge permit was ever issued  The State finally evicted him and burned the structure down. The sockeye salmon mentioned are stocked from Cook Inlet Aquaculture  China Poot has impassable falls thus no native Sockeye in the river. A few people whom enjoy income from existing development are concerned..,?
3011,The story is from the Washington Post...The paper that hired dozens of reports just to stop Trump at all costs....they have lied and spun everything since the beginning and this is just more of their garbage..!!!,?
3012,The Liberals are all good with great intentions and warm hearts - until it comes to money. Say $ and something snaps. The worst are the Ontario Liberals  they are disgusting. Not sure why Trudeau chose that same path knowing fully well how disgusting it is.,?
3013,Useless bums and good for nothings alongside the idiot Chump running our country into the ground.,?
3014,So you support Trump slapping us with an unfair 20% tariff on softwood lumber? You complain about OUR  government being corrupt? Are you on Canada's team? Are you ignorant or just a traitor?,?
3015,There is a huge variation in the ability to find a family doctor by city. I found a family doctor quickly in the GTA  but had no family doctor for years previously.  Timely access (i.e.  less than 3 months) to specialists unfortunately does depend to some extent on social connections in my experience.,?
3016,War using conventional weapons---yes.  Using nuclear weapons----is NOT what she's suggesting.  BTW----The Republicans also voted for this intervention---it began under Bush's presidency.  "The Donald" has no conception of what 'fine stepping' needs to be done as a president.  He thinks that he can run the country as a businessman can.  Worse  he thinks that he can fire people [like congress personal] the way he did on The Apprentice.  He has no idea that he is only ONE branch of the government.  He would have to work with both congress [both houses] and the Supreme Court.  And he doesn't know how to do that---he doesn't have the self-control.,?
3017,Aspirational self-identified gender? Griping about how two marginalized populations i.e. Native Hawaiians and transgender individuals tick the boxes sounds like you are an intolerant racist white male. You are a petty man.,?
3018,I'm tired of this ridiculous Snipe hunt. The commission didn't investigate or dismiss their own co chair who illegally voted in the wrong state. WTF Hundreds of Millions of dollars wasted on this   they could have wasted the money on something that was a lot less of a LIE.,?
3019,There is absolutely no doubt in my mind it's true. None. And we may very well see exactly that before this is all over.,?
3020,The SPLC is a racist white hate group that distributes hit lists to their violent followers. They need to shut down for their hate crimes.,?
3021,Daniel Donkel? Don't you live somewhere besides Alaska?  Why do you want my hard earned money supporting your investment interests?,?
3022,Didn't we go through this with alcohol probation back in early 1920 and 1930's and the government finally learned that they could tax alcohol to help support the government and make money and waste it as we all know. Granted Marijuana won't get us out of this hole (debt) that our Alaska government and the U.S. Government has got us into and the Banks are stupid buy closeing the would be accounts. With more money going into the bank accounts money will make money. And if the business can pay their taxes with "so called" drug money what is a business man or woman to do. Stupid Stupid Stupid !!!!,?
3023,Any destruction of Alaska's Grand Nature by the oil n gas industry means the industry needs higher standards.  The state needs to be the state (tax  regulate  oversight) and quit trying to be a partner.  Public/private partnerships are stupid.  Good read!,?
3024,Rotten to the core. Put them in prison until they perish. They should never have a day of freedom again.,?
3025,Let me guess  you criticized all of Obama's visits in the wake of Sandy too  right?,?
3026,Sounds like more ugly sprawl in the name of progress.  For an already water strapped part of the country.  Hopefully growth will normalize or become slower than average soon in Colorado.,?
3027,Clearly  Colorado has zero standing making law for the country  and that quote references the country. Therein might be why it was determined to be unconstitutional.,?
3028,And who are all those millions of stupid women that voted for Trump in the first place - it was no secret that he had no respect for women?,?
3029,So Hillary as mean to some people? Yes  I can see where that equates to grabbing women by the genitals  uncontrollably kissing them without their permission  using your fame and money to prey on women  trying to get married women to screw you while you yourself are married talking about their "big phony tits and everything " body shaming and otherwise denigrating women publically in general  talking about dating your own daughter and just being a general slime bag. Yeah  I can see that.,?
3030,All the names you could pick for yourself and you choose Foxbimbo?  You were going for staid credibility  right?,?
3031,Hey biden  you were useless in the US so  now you piece of fecal matter are trying to screwdrive Canadians. Put on your cement shoes and take a long walk off a short dock. Take your hag clinton with you.,?
3032,it was a clever statement about the stupidity of archaic terms  with double meanings  but these days you must always be literal in what you write and say so as not to offend the hard of thinking  ergo the columnists who write for this paper,?
3033,I stopped at the incadescently idiotic "toxic testosterone" folderol.  Pity for those unfortunate enough to have continued.  There is so much better out there.  Sheesh!,?
3034,Charlo Green is a very ignorant person who exhibited little common sense in the last two years and her legal issues have nothing to do with her skin color. Get a grip.  Jim Crow My @#$!,?
3035,Is Mr. Cheney running for president on the ballot in your state?  He doesn't seem to be in Alaska.,?
3036,The mom is a scumbag  I remember thinking that after her comments on her other sons murder charges. Lock her up with the rest of the degenerates!,?
3037,Menors comments are nonsensical. how is losing 1.5 B more dire than adding 5 B more to the cost of rail? just said this project should be called the abyss. this project will cost more than 10 B and Menor will still be crying about this 1.5 B probable loss.,?
3038,As yet they have been unsuccessful  but its not for lack of trying. They did manage to pass a ban on guns that look scary to them but it had a sunset clause and the sun set. Aside from the every time some whacko runs out and shoots up a crowded area some bunch of goofs runs out and demands that some or all guns be banned. So yeah  keep peddling your left-winger lie  the truth is known!,?
3039,Layla's got a point. ESL facilities/classes would really help. So would learning English be an understood condition of STAYING in this country. No attendance?  A couple of warnings  some investigation and then...out.,?
3040,Fool$ and there money are soon parted  ....it will be funny to see how many sheeple live in her district.,?
3041,Jim Minnery is an embarrassment to this state.,?
3042,Another fool pipes in.,?
3043,$even Billion over budget! Is the light finally beginning to dawn? Do the state legislature and the city council begin to realize that this pipe dream of a shopping center train is and will be a perpetual drain on the city coffers with little benefit if any? When will the bulb light that says: STOP! STOP! WE GOTTA GET OFF! ?,?
3044,the idiots in Ontario's Liberal government must  be on bad drugs that have fried their brains if they think Amazon would even consider locating in Ontario,?
3045,What a useless  self contradictory  specious piece of junk article.,?
3046,You spelled hillbilly's driving in a circle over and over. Lol you rednecks make me sick and you all continue to show your intelligence,?
3047,The headline and much of this article are incorrect. Rather than taking a shortcut by simply citing a memo  Travis J. Tritten owes it to his and your readers to actually research the facts. For starters  MAVNI is not open to all on DACA. Democrats in the 114th congress tried to get that passed  and they failed. It also doesn't apply to immigrants who must gain legal permanent residence and have a "green card" to enter the military. MAVNI allows people in the U.S. legally who aren't in an immigrant status--think those on student visas for example--to enlist if they have skills that are needed by the military and otherwise not available in the citizen and immigrant populations. It's not surprising Senator Warner would word his letter in a way that seeks to gain political advantage. It is surprising you would follow his lead and help him.,?
3048,Top three ways Hanabusa will invigorate the governorship:  1.  Mirror installed at the governor's mansion will provide timely reminders of "who's the fairest one of all."  2.  Remodeling opportunities will abound when a tornado drops a house - containing  a young girl and her dog - right on top of Washington Place.  3.  The name of Hawaii's capital will change from "Honolulu" to "New Salem of Eastwick.",?
3049,Glowacki  I cannot believe that this came out of your mouth.  Shared Services Canada couldn't stir up envy in Myanmar.  The only reason you have any customers at all is that federal Departments have been given no choice in the matter.  SSC is a laughingstock.  It's true that they were dealt a bad hand by Harper and Treasury Board -- savings were booked long before they had a chance to materialize -- but they have played that hand in the worst possible way.  They are masters of the combination of bureacracy and boondoggles that makes everyone think civil servants are morons.,?
3050,You would think after rescue of obvious foreign  undocumented fishermen someone would know  where they are. USCG should make a statement.,?
3051,Exactly. Interim F-35's are just as available.,?
3052,With plenty of range anxiety.,?
3053,Revenues go to the federal treasury  not to Alaska.   People that support this don't give a crap about our state or anything else.  This is a shameless handout to the fossil fuel industry - Shame on you Lisa.,?
3054,Spoken by a true Democratic.  They don't try to rig elections.,?
3055,ZIIIIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNNNNNNNNG!!!!!!,?
3056,All the pathological liar can do is spew bovine excrement  day after day.,?
3057,No  Trump was the greater evil  as we shall see.,?
3058,typical of you to not answer the question or see the stupidity of your argument.  I suppose your manhood is based on what Viagra does for ya?  yuck,?
3059,Thousands of Canadians in a hurricane crisis zone and Justin Trudeau was probably shopping for socks.    Enjoy.,?
3060,Save it  Dick Head.  For another time  another place.  Not here and not now.  This is about Officer Brandt.,?
3061,I generally refrain from any comment that might endorse a candidate - I much prefer to needle candidates for transparently pandering acts (such as wearing Xtratuf boots to a debate).  However  I am tremendously impressed with Margaret Stock.  She comes across as calm  thoughtful  prepared  respectful  and competent.  Her comments focus on issues  rather than dumbed down bumper sticker generalizations. If these qualities appeal to you  research her positions. If not  get out and vote anyway.,?
3062,When you elect stupid people they make stupid laws.  Liberals just want to ban all gun ownership.,?
3063,Then don't sign and let the US lead the knowledge/research aspect that other nations can capitalize.  Their problem is our problem-there are no climate fences  or walls  to protect our nation  It makes sense to work in a global context as to a shared purpose.  The details of financing can be adjusted.     It seems clear that Trump does not believe warming is related to human activity.   That doesn't make him stupid  just ignorant.,?
3064,it's called stupidity,?
3065,I'll go with Phil here.  I like this explanation  Phil.  http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2012/12/order_of_bill_of_rights_is_second_amendment_the_second_most_important.html  Now you go.,?
3066,The guy telling the truth is a "fool."  Typical.  Next  please tell us how stats and laws are "racist.",?
3067,While on their cellphones oblivious to traffic.   Bummers.,?
3068,Shut up loser   smoke another bowl.,?
3069,And I lost my arse when I partnered in a Jeffrey Dahmer cookbook.,?
3070,Bernstein is shocked that he and his cronies might actually have to cover a story fairly  inspired by the truth.   To a godless liberal  I can see how this must rankle.,?
3071,Caroline there are close to 200 dioceses in the US...many have more than one bishop....  There are somewhere around 2500 dioceses et al in the world and around 4000 bishops ....  You can go to CARA at Georgetown for very good stats.,?
3072,"Free shit for everyone" supporters have no clue what you're talking about  but you're right. Their tax rates for their middle class are unbearable and discouraging.,?
3073,This is an article about animal cruelty  hence we discuss animal cruelty.,?
3074,Don't forget  Don gets all the best people...,?
3075,Take the number of people that attended the Trump inauguration  times it by 7 and then add 50 000. That's how many more people attended President Obama's inauguration than did Trump's.  It was striking as the cameras followed Trump's limo past empty bleacher after empty bleacher after empty bleacher.   Nothing will get under the thin skin of that know-nothing  narcissistic Russian puppet faster than these puny crowds. And it is absolutely hilarious listening to the Trump people try to tell anyone who'll listen that the event was well-attended.,?
3076,Maybe for short milk runs in the city by virtue signalling organizations but not in the real world.,?
3077,I do. My father shot at them and I'd be happy to follow in his footsteps. Waste of good lead  though.,?
3078,What is your final solution for these useless eaters  Herr Gobbler?,?
3079,Is this Rod Almandinger  the confessed murderer's father  writing this post?  Another series of argumentative posts written by a Roy Anthony (note the same initials) sounds eerily similar.  Rodbobber  you're an idiot to lie and say David was running with these losers.  The evidence says otherwise.  The girl who turned them in didn't know him.  The Grunwalds didn't know Eric. David's friends didn't know Erick.  David had a curfew and obeyed it and even asked permission for an extension for just an hour.  No kid like David plans to go drink for an hour and drive home drunk to waiting parents.  Military parents at that.  The fact that you are so inarticulate and illogical indicates you're cut from the same cloth of the Almandingers -- if not Rod himself.  You are jealous of good people like the Grunwalds.  Erick had to make David pay for having a better life than he did.  You're as sick as Erick is.,?
3080,Shawn James-Leavey is a teacher?   Hahaha!  What does he teach - how to bypass the rules/laws by flashing hazard lights while parked illegally in a passenger loading zone?  Or  maybe he teaches his students to try to avoid getting a citation by jumping into the car and trying to speed off.  Or  maybe that they don't have to listen to or respect security personnel when they don't want to.  Does he also disrespect the school security guards?  If he thinks that he is right in any way  he should not be a teacher.,?
3081,damn that is funny,?
3082,Totally agree.  It's nonsense like this that makes the institutional church look like a bunch of idiots.,?
3083,Reminds me of the old way of determining witches. Throw her into the river. If she floats  she is a witch and should be killed. If she drowns  well  too bad.,?
3084,Thank you for your comment  moron.,?
3085,Science's role is to explain material matters  and that's it.   Religion's focus is the immaterial world.   Metaphysics grapples with the few intersections.  Science is but one form of gaining truth.  Rational inquiry (one of the methods of metaphysics) is another way of gaining truth.  A good bit of CS Lewis's work involves rational inquiry.   The problem today is a lot of people without real scientific training feel inadequate intellectually speaking  and play pretend scientist; they "give to" science what is not science's to study.,?
3086,Women sure don't like being grabbed by their *******  do they?,?
3087,Indeed! Poor little Trumpy with all these nasty people disagreeing with his narcissistic  sociopathic  racist and sexist abuses. Shame on them!,?
3088,It's lame to like your own comment.,?
3089,I can't imagine you haven't read DEI FILIUS  so--sadly--I must assume you reject its dogmatic teaching.,?
3090,Just as we expected  even the Economist article was entitled "Trudeau's flying unicorn hits a storm".... all down from here until the next election. Urban liberals  can't be that stupid..,?
3091,What a bunch of pathetic commentators. Americans must think we are like them.,?
3092,Who would react "funny" to her own post  especially when it's not funny? Domestikgoddez  I guess. Come back again when you are sober.,?
3093,obama and out of control congresses created the tea party  the sane group standing up for ENOUGHT taxes   spend wisely for once holding congress to account! we need that in canada pal!    and save the fox news stupidity  like CNN they have news   non bias and comment shows  bias  its call debate idiot. The policies of Mr Obama actually  and for the first time ever  reduced the portion of health expenditures as a ratio of the US GDP.   SO WHAT   the people consumers are getting sky rocketing rates and deductables with so many of the poor he claimed to help with it unable to afford such deductables   man you are ignorant    your  post shows you think GOVERNMENT is important  when its the problem   thank god the usa didnt let ignorants like your side win,?
3094,"If the guy is as drunk as the woman and they have consensual sex at the party  you can't later blame him. He was drunk too and not responsible for his behavior  like her. Right?" Wrong.

3096,No  if it is not necessary for you to tell the person (i.e.  you are not the person's parent  teacher  or employer) then it is not being blunt or "telling it like it is" (who asked you??) it is being RUDE because it is not your place to tell them.  As my dear Auntie used to say  if you can't say something nice  keep your damn mouth shut.   We may think you to  be a nasty  mean-spirited  and spineless  b*stard  but it would only be in rare instances that someone might HAVE to tell you such a thing.,?
3097,Knock yourself out. It's a lot easier when you don't have to rate four to eight posts just to get a single post published  as I do. So I assume I have to rate posts that you don't  right? Where's the thanks  ingrate.,?

3100,Chicago and DC.   Murder capitals of the US.  Tightest gun laws in  the US.  Does that tell you anything.   You might and I repeat might lower shootings with tighter gun laws  but the nuts will find other ways to carry out their agenda.   People hold up Australia as an example of what tighter gun laws can do  but they still have their own massacres.  Some shootings  but also but other means as well.   Look at some of the recent ISIS attacks.  Not a gun in sight.   Nuts will be nuts.,?

Funny how Japan is never talked about because they are not German white  but were just as despicable!,?
3127,You should always vote for who you like and who you think would do as you do. Trump wants to rebuild the economy and cutoff wasteful international tariffs that prevent American businesses from getting a foothold in the economy  as well as establish borders which all countries older than 100 years should have. Hillary wants to continue conflict in the middle east where thousands needlessly die and have their homes burnt to the ground by USA and it's partners  and tell you to shut up when she gets people killed or gets caught with her hand in the cookie jar. Not saying Trump wouldn't go to war but his priorities have middle east conflict on the backburner.

Lavish trips to exotic locations await our impetuous imps  such as India  the Virgin Islands and Paris.  Beneficial trade shows for Alaska  such as the Auto Industry Trade show in Las Vegas has our legislative superheros fighting for Alaska almost up to their last day in office  literally!  Some legislators are so devoted that they form a business related to their state paid conference travel that closely resembles the critical agenda that demand they fly out to attend.

3147,Clinton  the Democratic presidential nominee  called Putin “engaging” and said he was a “very interesting conversationalist” in some of those speech excerpts  which were revealed by WikiLeaks  “I would love it if we could continue to build a more positive relationship with Russia ” Clinton said during a speech to Goldman Sachs on June 4  2013. In the same speech  Clinton said “obviously we would very much like to have a positive relationship with Russia and we would like to see Putin be less defensive toward a relationship with the United States so that we could work together on some issues.”  It was no secret that Clinton  who famously tried to “reset” U.S. relations with Russia when she became secretary of state in 2009  pushed for warmer ties with the Cold War foe. But the excerpts suggest Clinton maintained some optimism toward that goal after leaving office and found ways to praise Putin  though her campaign condemns Russia now,?
3148,I agree with Mr. Wadell that all ideologies are not created equal.  He highlights some of the differences between Islam and Christianity  but the most important distinction regarding ideologies is faith-based v. evidence-based.  Stone age-ideologies like Islam and Christianity which are based on ridiculous unsupported fantasies have proven to be terrible for humanity.  Evidence/science based ways of knowing are far superior.   And while they don't guarantee immediate peace and prosperity  they most certainly give us the best chance for it.  That's why institutions in our society responsible for seeking the truth like the press  the courts  and universities  use evidence-based ways of knowing and long ago left behind the great engine of ignorance and stupidity known as religion. It's depressing that so many still hold on to these very old and very destructive faith-based ideas.,?

3166,So it is xenophobic for a waitress (a stressful job as it is  which pays close to minimum wage) to ask you for a short form of your name? Clearly  she had no problem with your background  she accepted a simpler form of your wife's name. I can tell you almost every wave of immigrant has gone through the same thing. Chinese and Korean immigrants in Toronto have an "English" name a well a native name  because they know most people will butcher it. Even Italians have changed Giuseppe to Joe  Paolo to Paul and Alessandro for Alex. And none of them had an op ed in a newspaper to complain about it. There has to be some sense that in a casual encounter in a small town restaurant  you could be a little more sensitive to the fact the woman hasn't had the opportunity of higher education  as you have. Rather than denounce her a xenophobe  you might want to consider that she's has some difficulty with your name and you could adjust accordingly. You're lack of tolerance is all I get from this.,?

3173,Marytherese  Having lived during the JFK presidency  it is unclear to me what destructive and subversive revolution was inaugurated under his administration?  I do not recall any since he really was only in office a short 3 years.  As for George Soros  he did not start donating to liberal organizations until the 2000's when he started to oppose George W. Bush.  On the other side  the Koch brothers are putting much more money to influence state governments through ALEC and higher education in favor of their causes.  I really take issue with your accusation that Kennedy and Obama were elected fraudulently and this election is fraudulent because you do not happen to like past winners and a potential  winner.  As a past election inspector   I can vouch for the integrity of our elections and there is no evidence that any president has been elected fraudulently. Your final comment that  Clinton and Obama have planned a WW 3 is beyond the pale of sensible discussion.,?

3177,No doubt  literature and art have certainly played a role in painting a false image of what this period was like. This is neither unique to this period nor to European art forms. I would also add that modern revisionist art and literature is now painting an equally false image of what this period was like. The only solution  it seems  is that the reader/viewer must not remain a passive subject  but should take an objective  almost cynical approach to what they see in literature and art with respect to the authentic past  whatever that is.  Moreover  the audience is also part of the problem because  like it or not  the painter/writer is giving the audience what they want  a view of the world that conforms to their beliefs  not necessarily with reality.,?

3193,Leftwing extremism of the violent form is pretty common - all of the G8 meetings have violent protests.  Also - 'mass immigration' is an extremist policy.  The Globe uses a few  rare Nazi idiots to spread the 'fear of the right wing' - and it's repulsive.  Nazis are not moral equivalents to those protesting them - but the violence on either side is effectively morally equivalent.,?
3194,Hitler was masculine?  So your hero is a man who doesn't beat up women.......he just has them murdered along with millions of other women  men  boys and even  little babies who were shot in their own mother's arms by despicable  inhuman  Nazi  sadists. They were truly deplorable.  .  Hitler was a coward who took a cowards way out. He couldn't face what his buddy Mussolini faced. He knew his treatment would have been 100 times worse. Comparing Hitler to an American President is not only odd  it borders on the   psychotic.  . Haig was a rather flamboyant character and I simply would take whatever he said with a grain of salt.  When Reagan was shot he mistakenly tried to take control  assuming he was next in line. He was a little bit  of a flake. He was quietly replaced soon after Reagan recovered.,?

3206,Well Ricardo I'm far from being a welfare recipient and I find what Walkers is doing as unacceptable.  He is not solving the long term problem; he is simply putting it off for another year.   How long will the Permian Fund be able to partially cover deficit budgets. An unknown number of years. There is no plan to consider what to do once the fund is gone.  Maybe part of the solution is to start requiring the companies who take every dime they make in Alaska and leave to start paying for the services they require to be in business.  Cruise ships want massive infrastructure like docks and don't pay what it cost for those facilities. Tourist companies use lots of J1 visa holders who do not pay anything towards what community residents pay for police  fire and hospitals. The list of the "takers" in the business side is costing the State far more than the pay for the services they require.,?

Scott Walker  who stripped public employee unions of most of their collective-bargaining rights and forced workers to pay more into their pensions and for health care in what became a bitter political fight."  Ironically  Scott Walker has trashed Wisconsin's economy. Minnesota is doing much better.  Hmmmm.,?

3211,HB1850 allows vacation rentals to replace their TAT license number with the tax broker’s license number and this will hide their hide their identity from the public and County officials. Just last year  Act 204 was introduced and requires all vacation rentals to include their TAT license on all advertisements in order to identify each property. HB1850 will compromise the purpose of Act 204. The Governor should veto this controversial bill and let the legislature work on it in the next session.,?
3212,Typical extremist  ignoring the family's plea to not smear and politicize this young man's name. Pathetic.,?
3213,Everyone take a chill pill...Trump isn't going anywhere! Not only will he finish this term he'll easily win a second term. This idiot has somehow become a cult figure and follower's of cults are blind in their allegiance to their 'leader'.  These people are rarely swayed by logic or reason.  The last cult with a similar style was Jim Jones. Sad.,?
3214,Since this is "going forward only"  how is this going to be administered to ensure existing investments are not affected?  Say you have 100K in an equity portfolio  and add $25k of retained earnings to it next year  any future capital gains are now based on $125k.  Over time  assuming 6% average annual growth  how will you account for what was grandfathered in and what was added under the new rules?  What if you have dozens of stocks?  What if you sell one equity holding containing a mix of grandfathered money and tax grab money  then buy another holding.  Does that one now get treated under the new rules?  This all sounds like a nightmare to me  and I guess the burden of keeping track will get passed to the business owners.,?
3215,Washington/Trump/Pentagon are playing games with a madman who must always be seen as a fearless leader to his nation. This madman is willing to send a nuclear weapon to prove it. Once that stance is taken he cannot back down or his enemies  standing smiling around and praising him will kill him in a hit minute. He is very aware of this. He murdered his family to protect his power. Anyone else is bomb fodder. S. Korea has tens of thousands of American soldiers stationed there. Kung foo doesnt need to go far will his rockets. About 30-35 miles? He knows China will not want any more U. S. access to their borders and mainland.  Madness.,?

3217,all for it  sir  all for it  and for giving everyone over 90 years of age a tax free income of $40 000 a year until final departure. have to agree with Nancy  double and triple taxation is a complete 'rip' and is morally wrong. and just remember  the Founders knew that a capitation tax would eventually become a bludgeon the government would use to control the citizens with adverse political views and sure enough we just had the IRS shew us how this can be done even nowadays in our country.  let us finally go for a flat tax for every wage earner of about 12%  and if you want to draw social security you kick in another 12%. and if you do not work  well that is just too bad  it is not fair to the rest of us. it would also be great if everyone who votes is also putting dollars in the coffers  but that is going to have to be a constitutional amendment. i hope this issue becomes a fulcrum topic in the upcoming congressional elections. bully for this representative.,?

I applaud your honesty.,?
3231,Considering that during the recent election campaign the BC Green party & the BC NDP DID NOT provide ANY details/descriptions of the new electoral system that they want to replace BC's current "first past the post" system   ...  & considering that the Green party leader recently said he wants future BC legislation to be drafted using more collaborative  more inclusive & more transparent (BUT NOT DEFINED!!) methods than under the current system..  ... & considering that during the last 60 days he repeatedly stated he wants BC MLAs to ARBITRARILY IMPOSE a new electoral system on the province    ... this indicates he is either mentally deranged or unconscionably dishonest...   Unless a political party explicitly describes the electoral system model that they propose should replace the currently-in-place "first past-the-post" system- IN A WRITTEN ELECTION-PLATFORM DOCUMENT- that the party is elected as government on... then THE PARTY DOES NOT HAVE A MANDATE TO CHANGE THE ELECTORAL SYSTEM!!,?
3232,A pervert getting away with a crime is no cause for celebration.  A "not guilty" verdict does not make the accuser innocent.  He got off on a "made-up" and manufactured technicality.  Thanks to a overly sympathetic & "politically correct"  judge.  He raped a minor .... forcing oral sex upon his victim.   To the judge I ask What part of that is so difficult to understand?,?
3233,Wonder how firm that these engagements are :  Buffalo  New York -- 2018 World Junior Tournament.   Vancouver  Victoria -- 2019 World Junior Tournament  Because if organizers do decide to continue putting this tournament on in places with pre-existing NHL teams  the tournament's attendances will likely suffer even further.  Fans do not want to see junior hockey in NHL cities.  If organizers put it on in smaller cities that don't have NHL teams (ie. Halifax  St. John's  Saskatoon  Regina  London  Windsor  Hamilton  Quebec City  etc.) real hockey fans will come out to enjoy it.  The WJC tournament's attendance is dying year by year.,?

Lots of writers and artists. Deeply rooted communities and some great housing co-ops. Yes affordability is a critical issue and is sapping long-term vitality. But a city filled with people from many cultures  like Toronto  Vancouver and increasingly Montreal  is as Canadian as it gets. Of course there are many ways to be Canadian.,?

I commented in the teachers raise article and no one took me on about wanting to know what is an Academic coach position that one of the teachers who was interview is doing.  I also wanted to know what is an curriculum coordinator.  i mean don't they set the curriculum by the start of a school year  so why do you need a full time curriculum coordinator.  What does a academic coach do? is this position for students or teachers? if its for teachers i do not understand.  did all these teachers get a teaching degree? pass state lic exam  but they still need a academic coach?  come people help me understand this.  any academic coaches out there? please chime in. and let me know what you do everyday for 6 hrs.  i might want to apply,?

3280,Lefties are hilarious. You yap about democracy  yet when you lose - you go thug. Let's summarize a few things..  1. Trump is the enemy of Jews. Obama and Kerry throw Israel under a bus yesterday  2. Trump is a racist. White people can't apply for jobs in Obama's administration. White Middle class America under Obama's is destroyed and working class families lose for the sake of gang drug dealers and Black LIves Matter terrorists.  3. Obama is the defender of the West. Turkey announces it has proof Obama is funding ISIS.  4. Trump's man Steve Bannon hates Jews. Israels applauds his selection in Trump administration.  Now we have Obama trying to hurt Russia for hacks that came from inside the US infrastructure from honest Americans patriots who wanted the world to see the scumbag Clinton machine for what it was. The most corrupt Oligarch machine.  Thanks God Trump won.  The left after losing are outed for what they are Totalitarian thugs,?
3281,Thank you for stressing that elderly parents need to be medically stable for 90 days. My 89 year old father passed away from heart failure and the insurance would not pay stating that he died of a “pre-existing condition” .

They all can not be idiots . Just like last year not all academy voters were racists  in fact I bet very few are racists.   So this year is the academy full of bigots as there are more Hispanics in the USA than African Americans and how many Hispanics were nominated?  But then did you mention that?,?

What did JFK ever do for poor workers. MLK came along and got shot when he was joining a garbage workers' strike. He knew racism  war and poverty were the triad of American imperialism and repression of the poor.   Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton also let down the workers. They actually voted for Ronald Reagan in 1980.    The point is the middle class has had at least 50 years of warning that this fascistic populism built on the increasing gap between the middle and working class was coming. That's why I don't feel sorry for the spoiled feminists marching who voted for Hillary.,?

3305,This is the statement that holds the clue to intergeneratinal poverty.  "Of the several causes of descent  there and elsewhere  into the intergenerational transmission of poverty.... Some causes of this remain unclear ".. Oh Really???  The presumption is that once no one was poor and then there was a "descent" into intergenerational poverty.  Instead of looking at the social  political  and economic history of those who suffer from generational poverty  Will compares them to "successful" middle and upper class.  Among "causes ...which remain unclear" would include  I assume  individuals for whom even a highschool diploma might be an intellectual struggle  through no fault of their own.  There was the Vietnam war from which many men did not recover; and a welfare system that for generations demanded there be no "man in the house." Asserting that knowing  which is the  proper spoon for soup as a cure for poverty illustrates the real poverty of the study.,?

3307,Ross is a bully  just like his boss.   He is engaging in a war of words in the hopes of convincing Canada and Mexico to give in quickly when negotiations start. Unfortunately for him he has tipped his hand. He does not just want a quick deal  he NEEDS a quick deal.   The best thing we can do now is not agree to his timetable. No deal by the end of the year.  I personally do not see how we could get to a deal by the end of the year anyway. The terms Ross will offer us will likely be so oppressive that no Canadian politician could accept them without losing their seat and their party's standing in the next election. The same goes for Mexico.   Negotiations will be protracted unless Ross caves  something he seems disinclined to do. I am not in favor of giving him the semblence of a deal as a face saving jesture. The guy is  jerk.  We had better get ready for a post NAFTA world  just in case.,?

3310,I'm not sure what you've said. Maybe some feeble defense of the over the top public service pay/benefits/pensions  by saying if everyone knows this to be true  than it's okay? Sorry  this inexcusable imbalance is having a major socio- economic effect. The pie is only so big and if we balanced it out there would be more resources for people truly in need or improved/expanded social programs (universal dental or prescription) or maybe even less taxes. Point is that this imbalance cannot be justified and has come about through the power of the public service unions to hold the public and governments to ransom. And if you don't believe that let's take education. Let's have funding by child and any school who attracts that student gets the funding (public or private). And the government still sets the curriculum and testing requirements. And then let the parents decide who has the best program. Just one example of many.,?

Someone needs to hurry up and tell them they can't do what they are doing!!!  It won't work!!   Furthermore  treating the citizenry well is abuse of a part of the population that wants to see abuse be the norm in society!!   How can we ever be happy if we don't continue to brutalize everything alive for the sake of the ruthless?     I hope they got a good dose of reality while they were in Alaska.    God help us if people here ever started being that intelligent and decent.   The entire world would go to hell if that happened.,?

Im still back on the fact that our own chief of Police didnt comprehend we had a 30% increase in property crimes  had to check his math...thought it was only 3%...  We are looking at the end of Alaska as we knew it.  Politicians have FAILED us to feather their own nests   Outsiders largely have ruined our way of life  they have infected us with this lower 48 mentality  their graffiti is on our walls  their shameful acts poison our communities.  These are not Alaskans  they are just scumbags who are here...and they should be gone.   I miss Alaska before this infection of scumbags.

3321,Caring about global issues is a luxury that more and more people find they can't afford. Check out the comments about Trudeau's remarks about phasing out oil.  "Perhaps the central question in Davos  a four-day affair of panel discussions  lunches and cocktail parties that delve into subjects as diverse as terrorism  artificial intelligence and wellness  is whether leaders can agree on the root causes of public anger and begin to articulate a response."  None of the listed topics have to do with voter disenchantment  and all they will get are ivory tower echo chamber thoughts. Maybe the Davos elites can go on "listening tours" of ordinary people  and get earfuls of what the commoners really think.,?
3322,I'm going to go a bit off the subject and know someone will react poorly but I didn't vote to legalize marijuana. I don't want my kids imbibing it since I don't want a bunch of couch surfers in the living room for the rest of my life. I am appalled at the amount of dope I see around these days. I was at the Doobie Brothers concert and the woman next to me tried to hand me a joint. I have a professional license to maintain and my employer knows all about random drug testing. That would be a difficult one to talk myself out of. Kids are smoking it at the Polar Bear Park  in the parking lot at the mall and at the Downtown Market. Is there any pushing back? Probably not. So I agree that the ones who took the CBD didn't know what they were getting but leaving $100K of product unprotected is... oh well.... what were you smoking?,?

3325,No one likes to talk about it  but the difference between helping sick people get better and going through extraordinary measures to extend lives that have essentially ended already should be addressed in any health care discussion.  My dad was 76 when he was diagnosed with lung cancer.  He had great insurance  and the docs and hospitals were happy to provide him with all the tests and consults and "treatments" to extend his "life" for as long as he wanted to continue to try.  He opted for hospice.  I can't imagine how much money he must have saved the health care system in that decision.  And he ended up suffering a lot less.  So many "health care" dollars are expended on the deathly ill to give them another few days to many years (I speak from experience here) in a drugged-up condition in a hospital bed.  If you want to improve the lives of the living  you have to come to grips with the fact that we are all going to die.  Of course  the Devil is in the details.,?

A staffer in the Alaska state legislature arrived at 20.9% and 1.6%  respectively  and calculated a comparable value of 5.2% for the fisheries industry.  In addition to a much lower tax burden  mining corporations are allowed to deduct their state corporate income tax from their mining license tax  and new mines are exempt from the mineral license tax for the first 3.5 years of operation  Value to Alaska?

In addition  if oil can't catch a bid and Ottawa keeps pretending it is the champion of the @middle class@ by cranking up taxes then it is hard to see the petroloonie doing so. Finally  how much of this strength is facilitated by the dumpster fire next door and the growing realisation that Trump's tax cutting agenda will founder just as surely as his campaign to repeal Obamacare did? The C$ just looks to me like the best horse in the knacker's yard at the moment...,?
3346,Only a fool would believe that the MSM is not biased against this president.,?
3347,Just as I noted yesterday. A rookie dipsydoodling around.  Confirms my long time suspicion of dumb overpaid multimillionaire jocks. Thank god he didn't take out innocent people. Good riddance you jerk.  Yah. Wonder what the clueless concrete lover Jays fans think about this.  I love being right 99% of the time.,?

3350,Ms. Crawford  Alaska got the representation for which it voted.  Our state legislature is a reflection of our U.S. Congress under Trump.  Until Alaskans and Americans pull their heads out of their hind ends and clean the crap out of their eyes  this is going to keep happening.   I'm done puzzling over how anyone could be stupid enough to vote these folks in. The only thing I know for sure is that they keep doing it time and time again.   You can't fix stupid.,?
3351,It is like Tom Vu used to say  "What is the matter with you? You too stupid to make money  come to my seminar. I show you how poor boat person make lots of money." That was over twenty years ago.,?
3352,Allow me to add context on Mr. Blair and his relationship with the press in Hawaii. He has been a unique voice in the media for many years. From his time at Honolulu Weekly  where he added clarity and colour to articles that really delved into the politics of the day  through his time at a mutual alma mater of ours - Pacific Business News  to his time now at CB  Chad has never yielded in presenting a "story of modern Hawaii". His knowledge ranks up there with the "greats" - George Cooper  Gavin Dawes and Tom Coffman. Adding Chad's knowledge to that rich history presented before  to anyone who wants to know how Hawaii is wired - will give anyone - Kamaaina and Malihini alike - the truest sense of it.   Ho'omaika'i ana Chad.....a promotion well deserved.,?
3353,Will someone please explain to the Idiot in chief  that the mass murderer in Texas was BOTH a mental case and armed with a gun.   It'n not an either/or situation  it's both!,?
3354,And I suppose you realize that the difference between those budgets is that the state pulled in over $5B in revenues in 2013 vs less than a billion in 2016. And that most of the budget "cuts" came from Alaska's capital spend.  I'm also hard pressed to remember any democrats calling for budgetary restraint. But don't let facts get in the way of a good yarn.,?
3355,I think Trump just reflects the general disdain for women that is held by most members of the GOP and many Democrats too. How else to explain that in 2017 the USA has not one single day of paid federally mandated maternity leave. The GOP is anti abortion but by golly when you birth that little sucker it's back to work tomorrow lady!,?

3359,Hey  Golden Horseshoe person  ease up. Leafers love their team. Leafers are everywhere  especially in Western Canada. The stands were loaded with Leafers in their blue sweaters in both Alberta cities. Leafers are loyal to a fault and this year they finally see a positive future. They are past the smash face Burkie years  the Flamers now have to live with that. They have a bunch of skinny kids that can skate like the wind and they will only get better. They will have down games like last evening but most nights they are fun to watch  win or lose  even  by non-Leafers. Compared to the playoff bound dull as dirt Minnesota team and other "trappers" they are a breath of fresh air.,?
3360,How many of you have said something cruel about someone else to coworker  friend or family member? We all do it  laugh and only feel bad when we are caught.

3365,It looks like it is the DNC who have crashed the henhouse. Why did the DNC refuse to turn over the server in question? The company which performed the study of the server even stated that they could not state for certain that it was the Russians. The owner of that company is a Dem supporter. The only collusion which I see is coming from within the Democrat party.,?

3372,Who are you talking about? I didn't refer to anybody as a "far fringe right" winger.

3383,I always felt that the 90-day session limit was more gimmick than anything. In the end  if Alaskans want better government  then they should elect better legislators. Instead  with very  very few exception  the majority of Alaskans kept electing the same conservatives from the same party to run things for the better part of 25 years and when that blew up in their faces  a lot of those same Alaskan voters resorted to gimmicks like the 90-day session.,?
3384,It is the job of the President to bring the country together. Obama was blamed as the most divisive president ever.  To quote Trump   "I've been saying for a long period of time that he's the most divisive president maybe that we've ever had and he had an opportunity to bring the country together...the fact is  he's been the most divisive president I think we've ever had.   Trump's challenge will be to live up to his promise that "I would be a total unity president." I look forward to that: a "total" unity president.  The greatest. So great. It's gonna be great.,?

3388,"Could Trump's much-talked-about relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin lead to another nuclear arms deal  further reducing the number of nuclear weapons?"  Not at all.  Trump is no match for Putin.  Putin is much more cunning.  Trump thinks he will just kiss Putin's butt but it will not work.  The USA is a country divided because of Trump's abysmal policies and leadership skills.  The chaos that is occurring in our country right now is just a distraction for the bigger danger that lies ahead.  Putin is sitting back and waiting for his chance to pounce.  Nobody in the US is paying attention.,?

3392,Who is it that is at fault here-- Trump or his PR people and lawyers? Trump's problems come from what he says and what he Tweets no matter what the lawyers or Conway or Spicer or anyone else not the President says. Spicer and Conway or anyone else cannot make up for the President's own words said or written without their input.,?

3394,Best to stop this now. But if this rail construction is to continue  in whatever form  then the legislature must increase the hotel room tax to help cover completion + future maintenance. As posted earlier  a friend going to a conference in Ohio got his hotel booking confirmation that says  "Hotel room rates are subject to applicable state and local taxes (currently 17.50%)." A total of 17.5% in Ohio  but in Hawaii a total of only 13.25%. Bump up the hotel room tax  and tax resort fees too.,?

3398,How many Catholic bishops will make a deal with the devil in exchange for an anti-abortion Supreme court nominee? What deal? Supporting racist and anti-Muslim policies by Trump! The Pro-life movement associated with the Susan B Anthony group have already doused themselves in the Trump Swamp. They have forever weakened and dirtied their message by glorifying the Pussy Grabber in Chief. Many people who may have been supportive of their work will turn away because of their mindless support of the GOP and a man like T rump.,?

3400,It’s not how much you spend  it’s how you spend it. We always hear we are spending less so it must mean we are incapable of performing well. Spend what you have smartly. And why does more spending go to administration instead of the teachers. Example of not spending wisely.,?
3401,Immigration law is THEIR JOB. That is the main problem with DACA; it is an illegal and unconstitutional program. President Obama said it himself.  Additionally it is far too broad  applying to teenage arrivals not just young children. Finally  it will only encourage MORE illegal immigration as all amnesties have done in the past and until we have a wall and massive legal immigration reform like the Raise Act  it means that those who get amnesty will be able to sponsor their entire families to come through chain migration.,?
3402,The fact that the author divided media into 'populist' and 'progressive' camps pretty much told me what his bias was.  The rest of the column merely confirmed it.  What I'd really like to see is this author (and others) make some attempt at overcoming his bias.  Stop telling how great your side is and how bad the other side is  because I'm just going to tune that out.  Be fair and honest.,?

3412,North Korea's missiles are not noted for their accuracy   so there would be a real danger that the missile would land on Guam. It would could be the best case scenario for the States  as China would have to up its game against North Korea  and take more serious steps then simply limiting trade. Nations that are on the fence with respect to supporting the States  would have no choice but to line up in support. Kim would lose any bargaining power as he would have crossed the line and inadvertently attacked the States. Depending on where the missile landed   there might be no loss of life  but again accuracy is debatable  so any loss of life would demand a strong response from the States.In an analysis of various scenarios Kim might well have determined that any error with the missile launch would pretty much spell the end of him. It is often the case the dictators are removed from power and life on miscalculations as Kim must be all too  aware of.,?

3422,A: Majority are homeless natives with drug/alcohhol/mental issues. Wrong. They represent a plurality of about 45%. Whites represent 38%. The rest is other "races."  B: The Native Corporations own 40% of the state. Maybe. But you obviously are unaware of the programs available by the Native Corporations or the decades-old efforts they have mede in this regard. And obviously  money doesn't fix everything.  C: Multiple no-bid contracts Huh? What does this have to do with anything?  D: The most modern hospital in Alaska  fully funded by tax payers  for natives only. Wikipedia: "The largest hospital in United States Public Health Service history  the center was built with 168 million in federal funds secured by Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska after a thirty-year congressional battle" After the old native hospital was finally condemned  Uncle Ted (You know... that "corrupt" Senator) finally got a place where Alaska Natives would not be treated like cattle.

3433,Donald Trump would not be able to pass a 7th grade science quiz on the subject of climate  or even the scientific method.  Trump is surrounding himself with stupid people like Rick Perry who will happily tell the buffoon whatever crap he wants to hear.  To see just how astonishingly  stupid and ignorant Trump's Energy Sec. is  watch him make a fool of himself (on climate science) on this highly rated You Tube video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETu9LP4bCkwt   Good on you Joel Clement.  Don't get pushed around by the idiots.,?
3434,So now we`re going to come out with stories of all the good things that drones can do...  And all the idiot drone owners who fly their camera equipped drones over other people`s properties are going to point to that one good deed to try to justify their ignorance.  Good luck.,?
3435,I agree.  They have every right to peacefully protest.  They and their views are constitutionally protected.  They are still a bunch of ignorant idiots who should crawl under a rock where they belong.  Maybe going forward they need to be ignored and ridiculed peacefully for the true idiots that they are.  They are getting all of this publicity which I am sure they crave.,?

3442,This is good news not only for France but for the EU and liberal democracy generally.  Recent elections and referenda in the UK and US and polls in many western European countries have consistently shown that a significant portion of traditional working and middle-class supporters of social democratic Parties (or social democratic factions within larger Parties) have  out of frustration  turned to authoritarian right-wing populist Parties.  The rise of such authoritarian Parties bodes ill for both our liberal democratic traditions and institutions and for the interests of these new adherents as well as the rest of us.  Hollands's decision gives the traditional moderate Left in France to get its act together and present a credible alternative to these disaffected voters and thereby help diminish the current ultraright surge in France and  in consequence  help blunt its rise elsewhere.,?

3447,The babel of opinions is why  100 years ago  HG Wells explained that electoral method is not a matter of opinion but a matter of demonstration. European academics  like Annika Freden  are demonstrating that party lists and their MMP hybrids have their own kinds of strategic voting  that afflict the party outcomes  just as much  as FPTP strategic voting afflicts outcomes.  A proportional count demonstrably must be of a preference vote.  HG Wells said  out of any number of feeble and ineffective methods  irredeemably open to mischief  that the right method is proportional representation by the single transferable vote in large constituencies. This is the HG Wells formula for "effective voting"  as the pioneer Australian reformer  Catherine Helen Spence said. Not to mention the BC Citizens Assembly. Richard Lung.

3460,The daily use of Cannabis medicine results in a complete tolerance to the psychoactive effects of THC due to the receding of CB1 receptors in the central nervous system  specifically the brain  and thus there is no impairment in the ability to operate a motor vehicle.  https://youtu.be/06rFDlvmICM  Recreational use is most often neither based on consistent strain and concentration of product as the user is seeking very different results than that of a medicinal user.  A medicinal user spends a great deal of time and effort finding the exact dosage   concentration  and specific product to use  and then strives to maintain a systemic daily dose.  this method of medicinal administration results in a complete tolerance to the psychoactive effects of THC but a recreational user is usually seeking the 'high' from THC and thus uses the product much differently,?

Howcum?  Because the comment can be ignorant.  It can be misguided.  It can be   stupid or fatuous  too.  BUT it is "civil."  So the "ratings" mean "be polite."  That's big in Canada; what we're known for.,?
3466,More lies. Trump does not act like a rude  swearing thug. Madonna said she has been thinking about blowing up the White House  told the incoming President of the USA to s@#k a d#$k and said f@#k you multiple times. Funny no condemnation?! And of course  it is Trump's supporters who are deplorable!   If Trump behaved that way there would be a full blown melt down going on.  Hypocrites!,?
3467,Here is some irony....  Kara Moriarty actually complained to the legislature last night that they needed to increase their connectivity because she was trying to watch something  then she switched to watching public TV which the legislature plants to cut because she and her friends pushed SB21 on us.,?

3471,Bad analysis here.  As Torbay mentioned  the gross cost for the Tesla roof is only $34 300.  If the alternative is a regular roof for $10k  then a cheap $10k shingle roof will only last around 20 - 25 years in Cali.  So you've got around $14k in roofing costs over that 30-year period time.  The net cost of the solar feature is then $20k.  You're looking at the utility bill savings that this $20k gives you versus putting it in an investment.  $76 700 is the amount of savings given in the article.  What kind of return do you need on the $20k to get $76.7k after 30 years? Answer = 4.6%  AFTER TAX.  Still  if you can achieve your 6% after tax on the investment account then  yes  you would be better off investing the $20k.  But there are two big problems here: (a) 6% after tax is closer to 10% gross return  a difficult feat to achieve these days  and (b) the risk profiles of the two are completely different.  A better comparison is a 30-year US gov bond: 3.0%. I'd take the solar.,?

3473,Useful idiot ahead  you are the poster child for this article  not one shred of what you said is rooted in reality or reason.

3476,One and done rules. Top talent  which only a few power teams like Kentucky  Louisville   UCLA  etc. has a chance at landing are gone after a year. The next level  ones really good  but not NBA material right away  stay in school and build their resume for possible future drafts. These players are also mostly exclusive to power conference teams. Third level players  very good also but not or long shot NBA prospects are players that UH and other smaller schools fight over. Mind you  there are hundreds of good player in this group  and UH can do fine with these players. People criticizing UH for lack of "top" recruits are totally missing the fact that comparisons in talent at this level is like splitting hair. There's very little separation among hundreds of available talent at this level.,?

The Blue Jays weren't in town? weather was ok? etc etc last year the Argos averaged ~16 500 per game which was by far the lowest attendance in the league despite the fact that Toronto is by far the largest population centre in Canada--the bottom line is nobody (especially the millennial crowd) have no interest in the CFL/Argos. You can be sure Tennebaum and MLSE will ultimately lose interest in trying to revive interest in this mess and either move this team (?Moncton  London) or fold them all together,?

Based off a 5 year average. He wants to cut the money that we would be putting back into the economy to bail out the states fuck ups. How about the state pay for there own mistakes and stop with all the dump road projects like upgrading our high way to 6-8 lanes. We don't need that. Slow down take your time or drive a different rout. Or all the money there wasting on bridges to no where. Or there own salaries. Don't cut the PFD.,?

I never understood what the fuss was about to begin with. She didn't have a "nipple ring"; it was what used to be called a "pastie " covering the entire nipple. So nothing was "exposed."   We really are hypocritcal about sex in this country.,?
3503,Aloha Curtis  that's quite a hypothetical.  Everyone agrees Ellis is guilty of minor civil infraction more than 30 years ago.    Some of his neighbors like him and others don't.  The DLNR guy and @JB Junes dislike him.  Sen. Rudermann says he's a champ.  For several decades we have been lax about dealing with overstayers.   As a result  there are tens of thousands of overstayers here in Hawai`i  many of whom have been here undocumented for more than a decade and are parts of US families.  In Ellis's case  a family with a wife and 5 adopted children.  The questions are about punishment for the minor civil infraction and whether people like Ellis should have a path to citizenship.  Previous to this administration we were deporting overstayers guilty of serious crimes.  These are demonstrably the kind of people we don't want to immigrate and why we have immigration laws.  Ellis isn't one of these  so I think we should think about his family and put him on a path to citizenship. continued,?

Omar Khadr is a traitor and a Canadian by passport only  he had spent a total of 15 months in Canada prior to his capture while fighting alongside like-minded Taliban cowards. The entire Khadr family is an embarrassment to Canada and so is this payout. Khadr is owed nothing. Canada looks like a pathetic joke among our Allies.,?

It's amazing to see the least accomplished president in American history gleefully shredding in mere months the international ties and reputation it took the U.S. decades to build. And Trump is doing so with the full complicity of the Republican Party  bought off with a few tens of millions of dollars in campaign contributions.,?

Note that this report was not commissioned by insurers.  It was done by the professional body of actuaries.  (Now admittedly many to most actuaries work in insurance so there is a conflict of interest.  Nonetheless  it was supposed to be a fair assessment.)  http://www.cia-ica.ca/docs/default-source/2014/214082e.pdf  If the public is right and premiums do not increase significantly  then actuaries as a profession will have a lot of egg on their faces.,?

3543,Finally  someone who "tells it like it is". We all enjoy the benefits of a healthy oil industry  yet some of us continue to act as if the very mention of the "oilsands" is a dirty word.  It must be nice to be rich enough to always take the "high road" when it comes to industrial development  but even the rich enjoy the fruits of said development. If you really want to "save the planet" get rid of your cell phones  computers and TV's  as well as your vehicles and just about everything else modern society provides. And that includes your vacations to places like Mexico  or anywhere that is not within either walking or cycling distance.

3545,My resume of decades of long activism for the wildlife of Alaska includes  teaching oceanography on a 65 ft boat  traveling around the state and filming 5 short films about our wildlife and traveling with them to the Lower 48 on speaking tours  creating and getting the support to pass a state law conserving 2 beaches of AK which was passed by the State  Board of Fisheries ( it was added to an existing law)  creating and passing a law on wildlife in my town and creating programs in my town to protect animals that live on our beaches. I also support and am connected with other groups who do the same work. In my travels I have met with governors  senators  state legislators  state and federal agencies  native groups as well as a man on a motor cycle wearing a bald eagle shirt who I made him a "star" in one movie. I have been at many state and local events with my booth on protecting wildlife in Alaska. I have produced many materials and hand-outs for education. All volunteer. Any you?,?

However  you are quite correct --it seems very  very unlikely he ever did throw a grenade at anyone.

One of the things that keeps us as the "good guys" -- and we are -- is that we should follow the rule of law even when it hurts.,?

3555,Need I add that even with cuts to the PFD and more major cuts to the operating budget  we will not escape recession  nor have a workable  effective State government. That demands new  reasonable tax revenues  INCLUDING a 01.5% income tax  and taxes on those businesses benefiting from the bounty of our Great Land - commercial fisheries  extractive industries  tourism/-.We can also contain government costs by giving PFD recipients PFD-paid access to in-Alaska ONLY services (described above ) instead of cash. This change keeps PFD money in Alaska's economy  benefits PFD recipients with important family/individual services of their own choice.,?
3556,A voluntary human extinction movement is  as fringe as one can imagine and has nothing whatsoever to do with liberal progressive thinking.  On the other side of the coin  the human species is breeding itself to levels where the planet will in the not so far off future be unable to support such a population and then things won't be so pretty.  (Read The Last Hours of Ancient Sunlight by Thom Hartmann.)  All the acquittal proves is that the prosecution did a poor job proving a point to one small jury.  The definitions of terrorism are: violent acts to frighten the people in an area as a way of trying to achieve a political goal;   the use of violence and threats to intimidate or coerce  especially for political purposes;   the state of fear and submission produced by terrorism or terrorization;  terroristic method of governing or of resisting a government.

3586,When you have a valid reason to take pain pills ask the doctor how many days should it be before the pain subsides to Tylenol or Ibuprofen level. Then ask for only enough pain pills for that amount of time. Ask yourself honestly if you are experiencing pain bad enough for narcotics  if you aren't it is OK to refuse the prescription for them or to not get it filled. Learn the measures you can take to decrease pain  decrease sugar in your diet  eat foods that decrease inflammation and eliminate those which increase it. Find out what exercises will help. If I don't go for a walk I get more migraines as we now know they are generally caused by poor circulation and I also have back problems if I don't walk.

3594,Give me a break G&M  Ontario's plan to sell pot is ridiculous! It will cost them two dollars for every dollar's worth of weed they sell - mark my words. I am just back from Washington state where they have a robust and COMMON SENSE recreational retail marijuana market run by private retailers. The stores are clean  safe and well-stocked and most importantly  the entrepreneurs are taking the risk with their skills and expertise while Washington state collects much needed tax revenues.  Ontario's plan is another Liberal boondoggle in the making for sure.,?

After eight years of impeachable crimes almost once a month  now the Democrats are trying to destroy Trump What does this prove?  It proves Democrats want to destroys those who voted for Trump.  The attacks on Trump are attacks against the American Voters! If Decent hard working American weaken the lying Democrats and their minons will win.  That is why CNN MSNBC keep up their attacks!  Those demons want to prove they are the real power in America!   Do not weaken.  Support really conservative Politicians.,?

Spending over 8 to $10 billion plus (don't forget after charges  there will be many!) to repurpose BUS RIDERS to justrify luxe condos  market price housing developments  Hotels at shopping centers  timeshares and strip malls under TOD is crazy.  The working poor are sleeping in their cars and tents.  Th working poor who use mass transit are hard pressed to cough up $60 each month. Gutting long haul busses for this monstrosity? no.  Make it a 2 lane express way for emergency vehicles and busses. On and off ramps are cheaper than stations.  Use the Train for a hygene station for the homeless who can't pay rent due to rail driven speculation and tax increases.  Demand rent control and more housing for the working poor  and a limit on the number of Airbnb  B&Bs and timeshares. We need cheap housing!,?

3630,Two very important points were made so far in the comments: 1) That the villages can become captive to people with criminal intent  and 2) Native Corporations not taking enough responsibility in these matters as it concerns their people.   The rule of law here exists only when there is a system to support it.  Most of these towns do not even have a police force that could enforce laws  let alone a courthouse.  These villages exist on the good will of their people.  Those without this good will have to be dealt with. Banishment is the age old way. Is it good?  Well  just how much bad is done by the problem?  This is really an issue Native Corporations should address.  And I think they will as issues continue.,?

3633,That's a ridiculous thing to say!  He could have killed her. Sounds like it was close. Way to blame the victim. The prison system is filled with the young and dumb. Poor impulse control is what put the majority of them behind bars. Just like this guy. He's a danger to those around him. Well I don't agree with 90% of what you have to say. We both hope he doesn't have children. I can't stand it when stupid people breed. Sadly they seem to be doing the most of it. That man has no business being around any kind of weapon.

3638,America IS badly broken and was broken even before the fuzzy election of the yahoo Trump. Given the stranglehold of their defacto two-party system  they need(ed) vision  priorities and leafership that was not provided by Clinton and was thwarted from Sanders. Yes  there are mysoginists and idiots aplenty  but Renzetti needs to look beyond that issue to realize that Clinton and an elitist  war-mongering  conservative Democratic Party allowed the clown Trump to prevail.,?
3639,You know  Goat that I would have a comment about Alex. He is a very smart  determined player who coaches love because he will willingly fill any role they ask. He was the best penalty killer we had on the Canucks and still is fairly quick even though he has lost a step.   But his biggest asset is that of being a super pest. He gets under other players skin.,?

3642,Yeah I Googled it:  http://www.parklandinstitute.ca/looking_in_the_mirror  It does look like maybe because of the size of population in Ontario and Quebec (economies of scale)  the % is not very high.  Public expenditures of course is not the same as public service but it is what I can find.  I live in BC and as far as I can tell  there is NOTHING mentioned locally about this and BC is continually being shown as a bright spot in Canada for this year.  All there is locally is complaining about how bad things are!  I think it is very biased to only find faults and not look at good things especially when it is so clear.  I can understand about Ontario  but big ?? why it is so biased in BC.,?

Alcohol and drugs are a severe addiction that are not fixed  by giving one something to do. The homeless have a lot to do just trying to exist day to day  no address to get assistance  no cash assistance for housing because single adults are suppose to be self sufficient and not dependent on vices  only barely being able to get food stamps to eat or bean's cafe.

3656,It's actually not slander. Public figures (Trump and Clinton) are actually fair game for such commentary. If Trump get's elected  he's promised to do what he can to change that. Just one of his many ridiculous promises which will not be fulfilled due to his impotence. But yeah ... saying Hillary killed people is the height of stupidity.,?
3657,Cutting Federal funding to punish "sanctuary cities" is unconstitutional.  Longstanding Supreme Court precedent mandates that the federal government may not impose conditions on grants to states and localities unless the conditions are “unambiguously” stated in the text of the law “so that the States can knowingly decide whether or not to accept those funds.” Few if any federal grants to sanctuary cities are explicitly conditioned on compliance with 8 U.S.C. Section 1373 (sanctuary jurisdictions). Any such condition must be passed by Congress  and may only apply to new grants  not ones that have already been appropriated. The executive cannot simply make up new conditions on its own and impose them on state and local governments. Doing so undermines both the separation of powers and federalism.,?

3661,I do know people to the political left of me that favor porous borders.  I don't.  What we need is immigration reform and to define  like Canada does  who comes here.  With DACA  there was a concomitant tightening of border crossings for work and increased difficulty to come here legally for work or otherwise.  DACA is band aid. What we need is immigration reform. I also agree that businesses are culpable when they hire undocumented immigrants and that the laws  should be enforced on those businesses.  But they are political power brokers and are not held accountable.  Don't forget that DACA recipients start businesses at higher rates than citizens  they pay taxes  the pay social security though they can't collect  they buy homes and cars. They give more than they receive. I can understand why people want to be here - it is the promise of America.  We should appreciate that and do immigration reform  not punish those who were brought here as children and now call America home.,?

3672,Powerful documentary on UK television tonight about the Trump family. The most frightening part - out of many - was Trump taking on Roy Cohn as his lawyer/advisor. Two posters have used the word 'demonic' in connection with Trump and his friends. They are certainly correct regarding this guy Cohn. What a creepy man!  He was described on the programme by people who knew him - devoid of human empathy  utterly ruthless. One person said they certainly experienced evil when in his presence. Decent business people (and some not so decent) wouldn't touch him with a barge-pole.  What they found most disturbing was that Trump met him then told his people  "I want that guy working for me."  They also showed Trump in an interview stating that 'Its all about genes." It was like interviewing someone from the Third Reich. He also was caught refusing African American's housing  on a massive scale  and at the court case  telling the lawyer opposite  "C'mon  no one wants to live beside these people.",?

3687,Yeah  I only have a degree in criminology and criminal justice. I'm clearly incapable of making logical conclusions based upon  ahem  observation and common sense. Or do you have a monopoly on that because of your oh so clever username?  I think you make a lot of assumptions about my supposed biases  and make a huge leap in logic to think that wanting to protect society by incarcerating criminals will lead to the erosion of constitutional protections. I certainly haven't advocated for cruel and unusual punishments  or violations of due process  or double jeopardy  or self incrimination  or abolishing juries  or denying legal counsel. I just want punishment for crime  not coddling.  By the way  if you want to get philosophical  if the government is going to neglect its responsibilities to protect the natural rights of the population  thus violating the social contract  do the people not have the right to do it themselves?

3695,I don't remember what Ted Kennedy said about Bork  but there is one reason that justified Bork not being confirmed to the Supreme Court.  That reason is that Bork complied with Nixon's attempt to obstruct justice.  Bork's two superiors had the courage to stand up to Nixon's unconstitutional order.  Bork did not.  That act alone disqualified Bork as ever being a supreme court justice because that act showed Bork did not have the independence to fairly administer the law.,?

3702,Deterrence with nuclear weapons works - no country that has acquired them has since been subjected to a large-scale military attack. Thus  if your country is on the Pentagon's to-do list  you want to get yourself some nukes.   Had the Americans been serious about their stated goal of non-proliferation  they would have refrained from starting unprovoked wars. However  GW Bush declared Iraq  Iran  and North Korea the "axis of evil" and then proceeded to invade the first on the list without any valid reason. After that  it really shouldn't surprise anyone that the two others scrambled to acquire nuclear weapons. We can all thank the hare-brained U.S. neocons for this.,?

3711,[The study  published as a working paper Monday by the National Bureau of Economic Research  has not yet been peer reviewed.] Get back to us when it is.  Until the methodology  data  etc. are peer reviewed the conclusions drawn are of questionable reliability at best.,?

3713,Yeah  never  ever look within to solve your problems  just blame the other guy  its all his fault. If he is white  even better  all the evils in the entire world are the white guys fault.,?
3714,"The fires of Hell" are mentioned in almost all--if not all--Fatima devotions. And a very angry  very pain-oriented  very punitive  very male  very capital punishment-driven God comes through when you listen to the Blue Army and others. I don't want to be sacrilegious  and I hope I'm not  but I have found it uncanny the research-documented-as-consistent one-liners from spousal  date  and child abusers seem to be transferred to God in the Fatima story:   "I've been patient but forgiveness has its limits." "You don't love me enough."  "You can't say I didn't warn you."  "Payback's a bitch."  "You knew the rules  and now you'll pay with pain."  "You damn deserve what I'm going to do to you."  "This'll teach the others a lesson."  "It's too late to say 'I'm sorry' now. You had your chance."  "Fear is all you seem to understand."  "I'm hurting you because I love you."  "You don't know your place." "I'll show you who's boss."   "Why can't you be as good as ____" "You can just GO TO HELL!",?
3715,Oh Gerald. How often has the NDP stolen Green votes by claiming that voting Green was wasting your vote  or the Liberals  done the same to the NDP? At the start of the last federal election  the NDP was trying to steal Liberal votes in a stop-Harper campaign. So what if people actually want to vote their conscience instead of strategically? You should be more concerned that the NDP might bring in a leader too centrist for the LEAPers  who then refuse to vote NDP.  Also  given the amount of negative campaigning in the U.S. (even more so this election)  it would not be surprising that voters choose non-traditional parties  stay home  or vote but not for President. If the election was based on sequentially voting off the most disliked candidate  we would have a Green or Libertarian President.,?
3716,And you're right  it certainly would be a waste of energy trying to back up your claim of equivalence  for there is not a single quote from Obama on the media that you would be able to find that in any way compares to the short-fingered vulgarian's distasteful and embarrassing behavior. It appears the fact that you know this to be true has easily dissuaded you even from looking. There simply is no equivalence between the dignified and reserved Obama and what he chose to express versus the blowhard and ignorant Trump.,?
3717,You cannot compel someone to do something.  That is slavery.  You fools convinced the Supreme Court that killing people is ok.  You can't force the rest of us to go along with your delusions.,?
3718,Wow  you are very misinformed. Eisenhower refused to get involved as a moderator between Ho Chi Minh and the French. If he had  I firmly believe that there would have been a much different scenario in Vietnam. The very first U.S. military presence in Vietnam was Kennedy sending in "advisors"  then building up from there. That keeps the count at 8 democrats and 4 republicans. I spent some time there myself in 1972.  Wavemaker - We are talking about actual wars and who was in the office of president at the time the war started. Please keep up.,?

3722,Seriously do you even know one person that eats sheep?  They are predated upon by trophy hunters  stupid men and women with something to prove by hanging somethings head with horns on their wall.

3723,The people in here make me sick. I'll not participate any more. There is just too much contention in people who think they are the Americans with the knowledge and answers to the mystery questions put forth by the oligarchy. Too many are falling into a trap and they don't even know it. I am going into defense mode. The right-wingers have done this to themselves and have no reason to call themselves patriots. None whatsoever. Too young and stupid to know why Russia is a foe. To stupid because they love the limelight. It's all just one frikking video game to them. You are being radicalized  just like the Saudis (et al) What a delightful juncture we have arrived at. If they asked you  would you kill your Mother? My vote is yes. Let's play another round!,?

3726,I am really unsure where everyone is going with this.  For the people supporting the cuts  I really hope that no one in your family  or any of your friends  require the supprt of government funded aid through programs instituted to facilitate this assistance.  For the Dems  the party has long deviated from being the one that represents the "everyman" to that which is supported by an elite segment of society with little connection to a majority of this country.  One thing is certain  and is not touched upon...where have we gone wrong as a nation that our only solution is to channel more money into a burgeoning military?  You only do this if you seek war.,?

3731,O'Leary is a coward!!  A coward for joining the race after the French language debate and for demanding sub-servience of thirty Conservative MPs before he would run.  Having based himself in the USA  he brings no Canadian civility  courage or knowledge of what Canada is or needs.  Canada's Trump..  likes the look of himself on TV and fills any mirror he stands in front.,?
3732,Do you honestly believe those towers of empty condos and ghost neighborhoods are being acquired for shelter?  It's not an option to pretend that a big part of the demand for real estate in some places is either speculative or demand for sheltering foreign currency. I'll let others speak for the GTA  but even the most bullish realtors in the Lower Mainland don't pretend that the ghost neighborhoods/towers here aren't real.,?

God Bless Cardinal Turkson.  He could be the first African pope.,?
3748,Interesting. For eight years conservative media considered President Obama a Manchuria Candidate. Liberal media scoffed it off including Bernstein.   Now liberal media launch attack President Trump on his mental fitness.   So  - According to media Obama sold out America in a treasonous activity and Trump is a doddering old fool.   Hahaha - and media expects to be believed?  No way   Perhaps it's media that is the doddering old fool with a Manchuria candidate mandate.,?
3749,Andrew Scheer being who he is will have a huge following by the time the next election rolls around.

3760,The Libertarians are no better  as their core issues are not the American people's issues.  Like the Dem's and GOP  they also have agendas which promote themselves first  and America last.  Only reason that they are not making much inroads in the election process  is that they are less skillful at it  than the Dem's and GOP.  And their leadership can't seem to control their own members  let alone an entire country.  And Sarah clearly illustrated that anyone can become a governor.  To become the leader of all  one must be the servant of all ... a character trait which seems in really short supply.,?
3761,I have a few crazy ideas I would like to float.  Along the lines of converting the Broncos offense to a run first power offense.  A run first offense helps the Defense get some rest and shortens games.  It would also allow us to use our deep running back group.  Idea number two is to trade Emanual Sanders to Carolina for Thomas Davis to shore up the inside of our defense.  this would weaken the passing game but allow some of the young receivers to flourish. Lastly  I would use the salary savings from the Sanders trade  and some Draft picks  to swing a deal for Muhammad Wilkerson with the Jets.,?
3762,But what does one call someone who endlessly repeats false information  after overwhelming evidence to the contrary has been presented?   Donald Trump is a full-blown  unequivocal LIAR. His leadership of the "birther" movement alone earns him that label  which might as well be tattooed across his forehead. His serial lies about the ex-President's birthplace were debunked almost immediately  yet he willfully and continually repeated that false information  to his own benefit  for years. When  at the final moment of truth  he was asked to defend or refute his lies  he gave the wimpiest response possible  neither admitting to his lies nor defending his point.  With a history like that  how can any falsehood or half-truth he utters be considered anything but a lie?,?

3765,Contrary to liberal lies  kids are learning that being white is one of the worst things you can be  being a white male is a double whammy.  Liberals love to pit one group against another and spread their hate that way Unarmed minorities?   Is that why some of the most violent areas in the country are where minorities congregate?  I know from past posts that you are black and proud. From this post and others that you are pro-hate.   Why should it be any more racist for me to be white and proud?

3778,"It was once obsolete; it is no longer obsolete."  What an effing moron.  Like most teenagers  Trump is starting to understand that instead of being idiots  the grownups in the room are pretty smart. It's too bad it's taken him 70+ years to figure that out.  He needs to go. The United States can't afford to have a dipstick at the wheel.,?
3779,He bragged about doing what these women claim he did... so either he was boasting about his assaults...or he was making up a   story about assaulting women to look like a big shot...I realize this isn't dispositive  but it sure paints an ugly picture anyway you slice it...  Either he was sufficiently stupid and arrogant to think this wouldn't backfire on him...or he wanted it because as long as this stuff is swirling around the bowl he doesn't have to talk about anything else...because he has nothing else......but if this is any indication of how he manages a crisis he needs to be at the daycare center with the other 4 year olds...,?

Gary tries to drive to other parts of the city  but he's always stuck in traffic because the City put roads on diets  and sacrificed lanes for phantom bicycle riders.

Kanehili Cultural Hui and especially Kepa Maly have done many volumes on the real history that few people know about- and that's why the HART Rail project wants people to believe what you are saying is true.  . Also the Navy BRAC (Barbers Point - Kalaeloa) in 1997-99 by the Tuggles  highly respected archaeologists  revealed the extensive cultural histories and large native population in Ewa Honouliuli that HART and SHPD want to see wiped out.  . One of the major volumes is "The Synthesis of the Ewa Plain"  a very well researched and documented study which is intentionally kept confidential by the US Navy so that the public  especially Hawaiians  don't ever know the real cultural story of Oahu.,?

We are now working well into July just to pay those taxes while our worthless loonie has driven food prices through the roof.  And it's going to get a lot worse . Further tax increases are already in place   compressing discretionary spending even further while our youth can look forward to working two part time jobs at low salaries just to keep afloat.  Meanwhile our Heath care system is falling apart and the needed structural changes to righ side it requires a Leader with statesmenship .  A fashion statement is just not enough,?

We are losing jobs.  There should be more tariffs and duties.  And on  and on."  Okay  so now there is a U.S. President who believes all of the same things that YOU do!

3827,The value of this forest is priceless.  But if you look at what the appraisals were--- over $400 million...why would we be so stupid/lazy to sell this important forest at cut rate price---- which  if the State of Oregon had done it right  would be making a profit every year- but because they proposed logging sales in areas that they should not have  they were sued.  That is why the Elliott did not make a profit.  If done sustainably and within the guidelines  we can keep the Elliott in our hands for all the irreplaceable ecosystem services is provides AND help fund the schools. It's smart to think long term- not knee jerk.  I attended the meeting and Governor Kate Brown has my full respect.  Now  let's do the hard work and figure out a way to keep the Elliott and balance our budget....hmmm maybe we should charge timber harvest taxes comparable to those in Washington and California?  If the elected puppets would stop being puppets for logging industry...,?

3829,You clowns really need some lessons in reading comprehension along with logic and reason.  This isn't a joke.  Your clown candidate has continuously proposed walls on both borders and a complete blockage of all immigration from anywhere in the world.  He secured the nomination during the primaries by declaring this idiocy along with the rest of his international relations fantasies.,?
3830,File this crap in the same file as the Palin trials and tribulations...who  except them  really gives a damn.,?
3831,Except it was ok to knock down the living trees on the land where sits the structure you live in now.   And all the structures you personally use  as well as the roads and all the materials in them and all the stuff in your house that you and your family possess.  And the pipeline that comes to your door.  And same for your friends and family.  Except for that stuff.,?
3832,Is this a plea from Russia or more likely a threat?,?
3833,It wasn't the user's first post with the inaccurate quote  but his public history.   That user is a particularly egregious example of a passive-aggressive "bleeding troll."   Someone who is so convinced of their own righteousness  knowledge  and self-importance that they can't admit other's opinions might have merit.  The "bleeding troll" will never quit. They demand all agree with them. Eventually they resort to ever increasing hostility and calls for others to help censor or ban the "offenders."  Thanks for asking.,?
3834,Injustice served. Oregon has an insatiable need to constantly outdo itself when it comes to acts of stupidity.,?
3835,One key indicator of lowering house prices is that banks are assessing an average home value at about 100k less than the price  on top of already reduced prices   and accordingly reducing the amount of mortgage causing collapsed deals.  Banks are like insiders to real estate game and now they are withdrawing. Go figure.,?
3836,So you "believe" Our Town encouraged illegal activity but have no proof...by stating that here  you're committing slander.,?
3837,I am trying to find what is new that Bueler proposes. He starts out saying we have a problem. OK  go that.  He said the problem was from mistakes of the past. Yep.  Three rulings affirm the legality of the deal. Uh  huh.  Because of this the governor and legislators have given up. Well  not exactly  but OK. A workable idea Bueler proposes is to change the pension system going forward. And that is how we fix the problem of the past?  Then Bueler plays nice with the existing pensioners by saying their pension needs to be secure and assures future retirees that they will have an "adequate" pension because we "respect them." Oh  and it should be "fair." Well  sure.  Who could disagree? But then he rehashes the disparity for older and future pensioners  suggesting a reform should treat all groups equally. But how does this address the three rulings affirming the current unequal pension for older retirees? The last two paragraphs are fluff.  How about details? That is where the devil is.,?
3838,Well  a black law professor got elected president.  Now we've "elected" a white ignoramus.  I'm not sure what that tells us.  Discuss.,?
3839,As my neighbors and I struggle along to keep our families fed  clothed  insured  and sheltered it is very difficult to watch more and more public funds used to support people who choose not to work  and repeatedly trash our community. I'm fine with helping people who truly can't work  but a lot of homeless folks I've interacted with seem quite capable  they just like the lifestyle. Especially in summer it's kinda like an endless Woodstock with the sunshine  drugs and camaraderie  but without the bands.,?
3840,Agree  ranchers  have open range and the cattle end up on the road  get hit  they complain.  The wolves are doing what they do just like us  they eat to live  but then again a lot of people live to eat.  If the ranger is so stupid to not know wolves are in the area  he gets what he deserves  but if he does and does nothing he is just as stupid  so if the ranger does not want to reminded how stupid he is  suggest find ways to make it harder for wolves to get his livestock.  I realize rangers first thought is to kill the wolf  I  then say my first thought if a cow is blocking the road  shoot it and move on.,?
3841,Unfortunately typical of what we have seen coming out of Ottawa and some of our elites over the last few decades. FDI will come to Canada if Canada has a strategy about which strategic capabilities it wants to retain or acquire and if Canada sources such capabilities in Canada rather than buying foreign.,?
3842,Hollywood has glorified drugs for years and the truly dumb want to blame it on poverty so they can steal more of the taxpayers money.  Losers emulate their heroes and todays heroes are a motley group of perverts  degenerates and drug lovers.  Political correctness has had a war against cigarettes at the very time they have been championing marijuana.  Hypocrisy  not more tax money is the issue here.,?
3843,The insanity of the coke-head  mentally challenged German Fuehrer Trump continues.,?
3844,Khan seems to be the racist and her religion supports pedophilia. Her Mohammed is the pedophile and many of her fellow Muslims sleep with young girls . I have heard as young as eight. It is time for Muslims to clean their religion.,?
3845,You are so correct. PSE is proud of their proposed chain linked fence idea. They deny any possibility of LNG reaching the ground  but in case it does  they hope that the chain link fence will contain it. They forgot to do the calculation that the LNG expand 600 times when it warms above 260 degrees below zero. It appears their chain link fence is 600 times too short to hold the LNG when it converts to gaseous form.,?
3846,It's now a sad daily ritual to find the same small group lamely defending anti-semites and racial superiority advocates. Is there anything they won't defend? Probably not  if it gets the right's seal of approval.,?
3847,If I searched the archives  would there be a similar reaction from you when Ted Nugent invited Obama to suck his machine gun?,?

3851,Luckily the museum got a hold of it instead of some douchebag looking to sell it to private collectors.,?
3852,Bradford Long  U R a douche! None of the protest makes any sense! The Rams recievers did their hands up don't shoot bullshit  over 2 yrs ago & I stopped watching then. ANY NFL player that goes along with protest bcs he is worried about NOT being PC is a faggot THEY CAN ALL be GARBAGE men like the fathers they DONT know or NEVER met. PHUC'em!,?
3853,I am as much of a Canadian as you are. You are a racist. Fortunately for Canada people like you are being slowly bred out of our culture.,?
3854,None that kill animals.,?
3855,wow the typical dark liberal twisted nut job post of the day  so you  can not refute the facts so its insult! ah  the mantra of the liberal  when they can not even support thier own government cause they too know how corrupt and pathetic it is..,?
3856,Note that delapp and other low income types pay little or zero taxes so they think its a great idea,?
3857,Sent the post to NP5491.  Pretty sure at this point you are a professional troll. I've been tracking you posts for quite a while and am now sure you don't live in Hawaii  and are probably sitting behind a desk in Bulgaria or Russia or someplace else. Why don't you comment on any other Hawaii Issues? Why are all you responses to polls the same answer about "fake news". My post had some hidden traps that you failed to notice. You could have blown my post out of the water if you paid attention to what was really said and the facts behind the quinnipiac poll. BUSTED  LOSER.,?
3858,These descriptions are not mutually exclusive.,?
3859,Nyanda was corrupt and largely incompetent. Maphatsoe is corrupt and incompetent. Niehaus is a lying creep. Most "veterans" were less than 10 in 1994.  What a crew.,?
3860,Gotta love someone who goes to wikipedia for the final authority on any subject.,?
3861,Why the hell do Muslims want to come to Canada if we are such a despicable bunch of racist kurrs?  Oh but they forgive us and try to accept us.   How magnanimous.  How much of their objection to us is just taqiyya?,?
3862,Typical article from the globe and Mail that keeps taking side against Canadian companies and on the side of American short sellers that are trying to use thinly traded stocks to  make a buck using reporter like you. Growth capex exist in every company and it is always excluded in the calculation of free cash flow. .,?
3863,I refer you all to the work of Elaine Pagels on both Leviticus and Revelation.  She uses cultural theory to explain these books very effectively - and why they must be taken in the context of the group rather than simply declaring them truth.  Sociology studies religion rather well  which scares religion to death.,?
3864,As an alleged liberal I view knee jerk reactionism with disdain. When you disagree and desire to shut whomever up because you don't like hearing it  you are a fascist  and if everyone is wearing identical blackout uniforms and masks  you are dressed for violence  you'd best be ready for a fight.,?
3865,My friend's 28 year old son put his life savings (from living at home) into a down payment on a 550K condo last year that will be finished in two years. Meanwhile he is madly working all he can to come up with the rest of the required down payment by the time it's finished.  But he says he won't be able to afford to live in it and will have to rent it out and stay in my friend's basement.  I wonder how many like him are doing crazy things "to get a foot in the door."  At the same time they are distorting the market and risking their futures.,?
3866,Where can I sign up to donate my entire arsenal of illegal fireworks to the police? How stupid are these people?,?

3868,My wife and I are there...  75 and 74.  My investments I made years ago (full RRSP every year since 1968 and more) and the method it was invested all that time and  is invested at this time  withdrawing the minimum from my RIIF's   I am not able to  spend the income from my investments.  We just bought a $50G car in April   took a $24G river cruise in Europe earlier this fall   heading to Cancoon in a week or so   to the Dominican this winter for 2 weeks   still have a lucrative business that only makes me work a bit for 3 months a year.   Life's great  lets keep the health for another 15 years then we will revisit..,?
3869,"..and we are going to specifically say that this applies to hatred against Muslims."  Why specifically?,?
3870,Don't be such a moron  you stupid MAGAphant.  A republican president  Nixon  ran on a platform in 1968 to end the draft.  A republican Secretary of Defense in 1970 recommended ending the draft.  In a BIPARTISAN vote  both the House and the Senate voted to end the draft in 1973.  Seems you're one of the stupid MAGAphant lapdogs who listen to Fox rather than using your brain - what ever small uneducated brain you might have.  But please keep posting  I love to point out just how stupid the MAGAphants really are.  YOU MORON.  (no fair crying that I called you a name - If you act like a moron  better expect to be called one),?
3871,I honestly don't know what to think. It's clear Duchene is very unhappy with things and doesn't want to be on the team. But whose fault is that? Did management not do a good enough job of talking to him and keeping him in the loop? Did Duchene's agent feed him false hopes and unrealistic expectations? Did he watch too much Canadian media  which made it seem like he *must* be traded *soon*?  Or maybe it's some combination of all of them.,?

3877,They suck and so does the show !!,?
3878,Who you calling "sir"?  Silly  undereducated republican.,?
3879,It's not the landlords responsibility to ensure the Legislature followed their rules. A contract was done  the landlord suffered damages of providing a building that the state backed out of.  Judgement for the plaintiff - $37 million.   These idiots need to be flushed out next election.,?
3880,When you elect a racist like Trump  who was running on a racist platform  like Trump's  …racist policy is what you get. It's called Trumpism. And it's disgusting. And so is the traitorous Trump.,?
3881,Please ignore diverdave  she is uninformed. Not all of us who support TMT push racism like she does. Obviously she is angry  hates all Polynesians and trying desperately to stir the pot under some cowardly troll username. Imua TMT.,?
3882,This woman is stupid. You never call the cops for "help" with your out-of-control loved ones. The cops will kill them. Happens all the time. It's not law enforement's job to "help." It's their job to enforce the law. So if you have a whacky relative  get yourself a taser or whatever it takes to subdue him yourself  because the cops are likely to subdue him permanently. Has happened right here in Anchorage.,?
3883,No  because that's what it is.  This has been today's edition of Simple Answers to Stupid Questions.,?

3893,Who gives "due process" to the victims of these home invaders after they've ripped off  vandalized   killed or rape innocent people. Quit your whining for some scumbag that could cared less about anyone but his own selfish self. Grow up!,?
3894,Well  it's an odd day.  The electorate of the world's leading democracy decide to commit national suicide on world-wide TV ...  ... and the only remaining superpower working for rational policies  free trade  and level-headed pragmatism is that great defender of democracy  The People's Republic of China.  Certainly never thought I would live to see that day dawn  and yet here it is.,?
3895,In a traffic corridor  as far flung from Oahu's traditional visitor areas as it can be  and that's demonstrably been operating at over capacity for a number of years now  it seems ludicrous to allow for the additional clogging of Waianae-Coast roadways with tourist vehicles.  Additionally  the Coast's recreation areas' parking lots and comfort stations are  no doubt  predicated upon community-usage rates  without consideration given to increasing numbers of users from outside the area.,?
3896,aa miller again!   cant refute or make an argument on his points so as usual you lunatic lefties can only insult! proving as usual how empty and pathetic the left is,?
3897,There's a lot of older that still watch TV...We all don't use electronic stuff... Please reconsider...Thank you.,?
3898,No  you have been outed (red-handed) many times....given your previous comment one can only conclude that you are a hypocrite.,?
3899,Cohen is the epitome of the elite Republicans who have controlled the party for too long and now see their control slipping away.  Their fascist  corporate welfare policies have destroyed the middle class. The imperial war mongering policies have cost trillions and tens of thousands of lives.  The jig is up  millions are waking up. That is why Trump has more votes than any other previous Republican candidate.  The elites like Cohen have enriched themselves by exporting American jobs and calling it "free trade"  allowing 30 million illegals to invade our country to keep wages low  and government contracts fueling the military industrial complex to the point where the USA military is bigger than the next ten countries combined.  Notice the call from Republican leadership and Cohen to vote for Clinton. This is all the proof positive needed to show anyone the game is rigged.  It should provide more incentive to put an outsider like Mr. Trump in to sweep out the dirt.,?
3900,No actually Jake Hanson was the center last year. Played all year long. I was at the spring game and noticed a couple from pisarcik or okun but not Hanson  he's been solid.,?
3901,Walter  many of us do not live in cities or towns. I have a well and septic system......which I paid for with my money. No government assistance  only government requirements and inspections.,?
3902,Let's just say it - South Asian and Chinese immigrants  their corruption obtained money and their caste system mentality is destroying Canada.  Their lack of ethics  morals and compassion for the poor and lower economic and social classes they bring from their third world countries is destroying our social fabric.    Sorry political correctness losers  that's the reality.,?
3903,I can give examples of the peaceful Muslim missionaries murdering people 100 to 1 of your examples.  Islam is the religion of death.,?
3904,Ritte  this whole thing is rigged by the HLA  Cook  Martin  WESPAC and slave traders.  I stand with you  Thompson  Aila  and the other Hawaiians that know and understand the truth.  Make the area "kapu" then all the good fish will come to be enjoyed by all Hawaiians.  "Kapu" is to preserve  to cleanse  to maintain  to protect for everybody.  Ritte  "kapu" this place and everybody going eat.  Leave it as it is and we will waste and pollute and end up with kukai. all over our faces. Greed  Bradda Ritte  Greed.,?

3906,Taubes is an idiot who should not get the publication press he gets. No better than Dr. Oz. Please find your health information elsewhere.,?
3907,Sloppy game  tight all the way. The Broncos had better learn how to close out a game. Going 0-4 in the RZ and 0-2 with goal to go isn't going to hold for 12 more games. Simmons saved the day with his game ending INT when it looked like the Broncos were gonna lose it with under 2 minutes to play... oh well  my nails will grow back but my nerves have permanent damage. Congrats on the win and could someone please send me some of that Colorado body relaxer - enough to get through the rest of the season?,?
3908,"And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye  but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?"     Yes  yes  I know. . . we are to overlook 30 years of Clintonian perfidy  grand theft  misogyny  dereliction of duty  misconduct in office  perjury  bribery  corruption  and a couple of misdemeanors thrown in.  We are to overlook all of THAT  and concentrate on what Donald Trump once said about the Iraq War (one that HRC supported before she was against it).  We should also ignore a litany of scandals hanging about HRC's neck like a dead albatros  and be concerned with Trump being a tad overblown in his speech.      I wager that that 'beam' in your eye stings;  Would you like to borrow a pair of tweezers?,?
3909,You remain ignorant of what the word racist means and how it applies in this case.,?
3910,A closed mind is a dangerous and sad thing. Be happy with what you think  but leave others alone. They might have something to offer that you don't  can't  refuse.,?
3911,Imho  the irony is the propaganda this regime perpetuates  that the United States is their greatest enemy  which is another way of saying our country alone  is capable of exerting untold influence to change their country  their way of life.    The rhetoric sometimes heard is that the United States has tried and failed for nearly 50 years to change the relationship with North Korea  that things will never change.  Perhaps the right way to look at this issue is as a generational problem?   As said by Mattis  there are always diplomatic options.  In another 50 years  which is a relatively short period of time  history may have a different view of North Korea.    There must be absolute clarity that everyone must do everything possible to avoid history woefully talking about a war where millions were killed  that could have  should have  been avoided.,?

3914,You are the disgrace  unwilling to accept that America's cult of gun worship has a terrible price in innocent blood. Shame on you  caring more about your guns than the lives of your fellow citizens.,?
3915,One of the diversity hires,?
3916,"He is just here to do his job  nothing more  nothing less."  A "job" that he is getting paid nearly $20 Million a year to do.  A "job" that most Dominicans would kill for.  Another spoiled Millionaire brat who never learned to skate.  B'bye  bat flippin' LOSER !,?
3917,Richard my only request is people that make comments have to use their real name. You have something to say  then be man or woman enough to stand by your statement with your real name not this crap you see now.,?
3918,Free will...is that a humanity issue? The point is...people were consensenting. It's not the state's job to judge people's morals. I'm sure people in the industry are well aware of the risks. It's your morals that say they are ruining their lives  it's not their morals. And who can force one's morals onto another person? Not even God....free will.,?
3919,At least he can spell the word "moron.",?
3920,What? They might actually have to try something original instead of blowing up the big space gun again?...  Personally I can list about 50 Hugo nominated SF books I would rather see - The Forever War  Hyperion  Spin  Old Man's War etc. -  it is an absolute shame these are being ignored while $200M gets sunk into producing this schlock.,?
3921,Big fat NO. Idiots only know how to spend spend spend. At least wait for our great Rail to be completed. Blaisdell is okay for now. And we elected these clowns. Why do you think we in the hole. Property taxes going up  water going up  sewage  Bus etc. I wouldn't doubt that some of those dollars are to support their spending habits.,?
3922,You have to be a real moron to trust any politican  let alone a nasty  evil person like the Obummer.,?
3923,Hey all you stupid clowns trying to run the State.STOP buy us out then shut your mouth and your BS.,?
3924,gee   you forgot the big one---he named a conservative judge to the supreme court . That guy will impact American life for the next 30 years . He hasn't gone anywhere.  Plus   during his two terms he may get to name two more . He just needs one to make abortion illegal again.  Keep rooting against him   as he's helping make America great again.,?
3925,"white people are the real terrorists". This lady is racist.,?
3926,are you really that stupid? trudeau is the answer  he has taking fiscal sanity and started SPENDING  BORROWING etc   harper didnt make him do it pal   actually trying to blame harper for the 180 deg change in direction is pathetic and as dumb as the libs in ontario blaming harris for everything,?
3927,Everyone knows this history. What they often don't know is that Piscotty Castle was the inspiration for Castle Wolfenstein.,?
3928,That's NanakuliBoss's problem.,?
3929,Sorry  was I threatening your pre-conceived notion that smoking is invariably the cause of every health problem that besets a former or current smoker? Trying to fashion plausible explanations for an intuitively obvious choice by a medical professional to blame tobacco when there were two other far more likely causes makes you sound more than a bit defensive.,?
3930,"we"? Sorry mate but I don't feel that way  and numerous other rational Canadians don't either.  Can I suggest an edit? Replace 'we" with "paranoid  fear mongering  irrational  and ignorant",?
3931,That is probably the dumbest argument in the world...,?
3932,james Dickey  that's Absolute bull crap!,?
3933,I will interpret your "yikes" as meaning: "Hey good point  I would have never thought of that  and I think you're right  if the side that loses a war wants the history to be told  they have to include all of the story."  Thanks  pochococonut  for your thoughtful agreement.,?
3934,Some of the posts allude to a bit of embezzling? A lovers' quarrel might call for a drive away for a few hours then a phone call? I thought that she may have forgotten to take her lithium. No - it wasn't just a fleeting moment gone awry.,?
3935,Real ID doesn't say a thing about what Alaska has to do.  It does define what documents will be recognized for federal purposes.  That's the prerogative of the national legislature.,?
3936,Idiot,?
3937,Why make this movie  and why feature Palin promoting it?  The money!  This movie isn't intended to change anybody's mind on climate change - if they wanted to reach out to people who were seeking answers they certainly wouldn't bring Palin into the picture  because she's widely known to be a grifter idiot.  No  this is all about getting the true believer rubes to part with their money.    It's porn for conservatives. Nothing more.,?
3938,I like how you lump 'em all together dismissively and condescendingly. It reminds me of how white South Africans would discuss "those annoying black people...always wanting something.",?
3939,The 9th had plenty of legal- Constitutional - bases to rule he way they did. And they cited them throughout  whereas Trump's attorneys reasoning was basically "because."  The order was quite enlightening  especially as regards judicial review of executive actions  due process considerations and religious discrimination. Intent does matter. At any rate as FM said  they did not get to the meat of the order.,?
3940,One thing you can depend on. If Trump has dug himself into a ditch  he will find a way to make the hole deeper. What a total loser.,?
3941,Everytime a Trump turd floats to the surface you say it's Fake News.  That is  until Trump confirms it (i.e. Lester Holt)  then you go silent.   You should do that from the get-go  son.,?
3942,He's a cretin  mentally and socially. There is no other explanation.,?

3949,Alaska has always been treated like a colony to suck dry.,?
3950,First of all  before a week ago nobody even really knew what players were kneeling for. Now they've been tricked into thinking they're defying Trump by kneeling during the national anthem  which is actually just extremely disrespectful to the people who fought and died for a country where spoiled athletes can make 10x more money than most company CEOs.   Very stupid move that made a lot of people angry.,?
3951,Funny how a bunch of idiots stumbled into WWI  wonder why?,?
3952,Where in india are there too many brown people  bigot? Name the town. The street  the house? Which indian family do you think shouldn't exist ?,?
3953,Navy sonar is 100db LOUDER than the sound cannons that are used by police for crowd dispersal plus the sound travels farther with less attenuation in water. Even so  they say that their program will not affect marine life. Is the Navy stupid? or Does the Navy just think that we are stupid? I can see no third alternative.,?
3954,Good point. Cultural suicide by useful idiots on the left has regressed western Europe to the cusp of widespread civil unrest. Europe's social fabric is festering like an open wound. The "progressive" left dithers with political impotence and pretends everything is fine. Everything is not fine - from Sweden to Denmark to Germany to France - gender equality and secularism are not a function of cultural relativism - they are values representative of advanced civilized societies and should be defended accordingly without fear of offending misogynists who demand we accommodate regressive cultural practices under the guise of religious piety.,?
3955,Trying to understand Trump supporters by reading NCR trolls' comments (News flash: spite is an emotion too.) is like trying to understand Sanders supporters by reading "Give Me Money" signs propped up next to passed-out drunks in the train station.,?
3956,Have you actually read the Ordinance? Carefully constructed policy and planning? I think the Cherry Street Project parallels the same careful policy and planning of the so-called Home Opportunity Fund. Allow me to point out a few gems: - Updates to development regulations - Only now being done after the problem is so restrictive even the HOF needs the rules loosened. Then has the audacity to suggest the private sector has not met this need. - Causes the property tax cap reset at the higher rate  clearing the way for future increases without a vote. - Multiple layers of administration adds costs for everything BUT building. 10% for County admin  15% for "ancillary" a cut for the non profits  40 years of oversight to be endowed. Where is the money for housing? - Most outrageous is the carefully constructed language designed to deceive our citizens. Temporary Transitory Accommodations=Tent Cities. RCW36.01.290 Prop1 HARMS thousands to help a few  but our mighty planners missed this fact.,?

3959,You looser need to understand we lost our Country we have no Country  we have no leadership. Thus no Country  Our Country's gone the way of illegal Drugs  welfare no hopers  illegal emigrants and their gangs. Young men who haven't the backbone to support their military and refuse to serve. A government that hasn't the balls to protect Americans against the Drug Cartels that are DISTROYING what's left of America. Politicians no one wants because they can't be trusted to make the hard dicisions  because it might cost them their political career. Now that our Country has all these problems  we've the Democrates refusing to admit they lost  Instead of working with the President for the good of all they worry about his tax returns  I could careless about his damn taxes.  More power to anyone who can rip the corrupt IRS off,?

3962,Well white people certainly are terrorists there is no denying that (Trump  Bush  Obama  Clinton..Hillary a full on terrorist)...Khan's mistake is that she wants to leave it at that and not have a fuller discussion.  Ex. Sunni terrorism over Shia (In Pakistan Shia's have claimed discrimination for decades)..  Israeli's are taught from early on to detest Muslims..... Mandarin detests Cantonese....  Japanese vs. Chinese....   She does herself an intellectual disservice by limiting just to white people....a people her parents thought worthy of joining for the benefits..  I kinda feel sorry for them in all of this....likely just good folks trying to get by.,?
3963,you are a threat to intelligence with that stupidity.,?
3964,Pathetic. Maybe some one should "disarm" Harvey.,?
3965,There is no "right" to free birth control in any part of the constitution.,?
3966,Perhaps you read too much into this.  Is he writing and speaking FOR indigenous people  or ABOUT them?   He's not a designated spokesperson; he's an academic and writer.   As long as you look for the opportunity to be offended  you will find it.,?

3972,You presume that people don't know or understand the small business owners in our communities. You presume too much.,?

3976,"Therefore  they should be made public employees  like any other public employees....This would include pension  benefits  overtime pay as well as responsibilities e.g. the government would have the right to request a physician provide service for an acceptable designated amount of time to an underserved community. "  ...and then you'd cry foul that your salary got slashed (which is how society pays for pension  benefits  overtime allotments... )  And good luck forcing doctors to provide for underserviced communities.  Many/most would balk and take their ball and go home rather than go to isolated/northern/aboriginal communities to help where needed.,?

3981,When you say 'here' you mean Russia  right?  You paid Putin trolls are going to have a hard time spinning this like it's our fault that Russia is lead by a murderous and corrupt thug.  Russia loses more respect every day under Putin. At least you have Syria and Iran.,?
3982,I suspect this is why the bodies are piling up.  Silence equals revenge.  You shoot me.  I shoot you.,?
3983,150 million isn't chump change for anyone  especially the highly leveraged Donald Trump. By that I mean  he owes a lot  and cash flow is important to him - he needs the next deal to pay for the last deal. There is a major conflict of interest here  and calling 150 million "chump change" is an argument that makes you look foolish.,?
3984,I think it is kinda funny how it is said that the dude was Nazi.  I would guess that the dude knows virtually nothing about that group of almost 100 years ago.  So the dude goes around drawing swastikas.  A Nazi  that does not him make - just an idiot.,?
3985,ILISAYL   I've often wondered why Canada has favoured the non-state-to-state elements of NAFTA's Chapter 19  especially when we now see the many cases where US companies use the companies-to-state route to attack legitimate and long-standing Canadian Federal orcProvincial public policy health and labour practices protections.  Further  these were (and remain) matters of contention obstructing the full implementation of our CETA treaty with the EU.    Would it not be in Canada's interest to have Chapter 19 pruned back in the direction of the corresponding WTO provision? Wouldn't it be in Canada's interest to accede to EU member State pressure to restrict or eliminate the CETA provision that mirrors the companies-to-state provision whether NAFTA is modified in this regard or not?,?
3986,But these places don't have the employment opportunities available in the major markets.,?
3987,poor poor terrorist baby,?
3988,I hear ya Rudder.  The same folks who are furious about a couple guys dropping a charging moose and charging dog  will try to say guns are irrelevant for stopping bears.  The facts say otherwise.  Projecting your own inadequacies onto other people just makes you look silly and off your meds.  But if the instructions on your RX bottle say do not operate machinery  then by all means  bring pepper spray and an orange whistle.,?
3989,Again  same idiot wants to be the judge of what is "idiotic."  Now that's rich...,?
3990,Are these people for real? Do they REALLY think we are going to fall for this? These people have been in our government for so long  they actually believe this crap! The LIO (spell it backward)!? Kabata? Watana? No mention of the Greatest Giveaway in The History of Alaska in The Last Two centuries? Are you nuts? This is such a sham  I couldn't show my face in public...or privately in my own mirror. I am beyond words. These incumbents have to go. There are NO two ways about it!,?
3991,Liar  liar; pants on fire.,?
3992,Just be happy that Trump isn't going to treat Canada the way he has Mexico.,?
3993,Over the long term the net change in carbon due to forests is zero.  Young trees need carbon.  Old trees die and give it up to the atmosphere.  There are short term changes caused by logging  but even 2 by 4's eventually rot and give up their carbon.,?
3994,You mean sweat like Trump?  Yes  he's feeling the pressure from Mueller.  Has it ever occurred to you that HRC is not the President?  I think it is you that is brain dead.  You blindly follow your leader's distractions  all 30% of you.,?
3995,Canada has always been a branch-plant economy.  From when we were a colony  to when the big 3 automakers were the backbone of our economy  to today with so many google branch offices opening up. With Trudeau dragging us yet further away from the utopia of being a small-to-large business mecca  we are a destined to continue being a branch plant economy in perpetuity.,?
3996,Actually  in the US  most terrorists are nominally Christian.,?
3997,Many a bumbling idiot has installed himself-or has been installed-as dictator.  No one thought such a flawed undivual could win the presidency either. That he did it illegally  with help from at least one foreign government doesn't make it less likely he'll be a dictator  just the opposite. Trump is Dictator-Elect   On A String.,?

That's like smacking your mom for feeding you a cheeseburger instead of cheese and crackers But   football players haven't ever been accused of being intelligent either.....

4016,Dude was speedballin like a champ.... Up until the heroin took its turn and made him nod out.that's the attraction to mixing the two and administering them simultaneously. It gives the user an extreme roller coaster effect. Really tweaking then nodding out and back and forth. Makes for a real good time! Unless you're falling out behind the wheel! Then that roller coaster isn't as much fuckin fun! The police show up take the rest of your dope  lock yer tweaking ass in a cell(if you're lucky by yerself!)

4019,Designing and building is but half the the story. The under-reported story concerns operations and maintenance. The federal government should provide thorough training to FN residents interested in running their own plant. That training should be to the level of journeyman qualification  with pay commensurate to qualifications. In time and with experience such home-based personnel would provide invaluable help in the design  modification  and other aspects of water treatment plants. It would provide these people with a foundation for a sound career and long-term employment at home or anywhere else in Canada.,?
4020,Indeed!  It seems like it was a ridiculous dual-job  anyway -- Germany alone is a huge file  and the EU is a super-huge file  especially with the EU in bust-up mode (Brexit  at the very least).,?
4021,I have been tracking 10 properties since April  and only 3 of them have been sold. A few have "resurfaced" after failing to be sold  and their owner admitted to pulling them out of the market for a few months.  I am quite astonished that the G&M would allow this type of "advertorial" to be published. The most flagrant violation is the lack of counter opinion in this article. The TREB guy's opinion is mentioned in every line without a single opposing opinion!!!  Shame on the G&M...,?
4022,It is funny when people say single payer health care doe not work yes it does all over the world  gun control does not work but again it does all over the world.

This idiot is going to simply throw money at going after individuals  rather than doing his job and pushing to phase-in e-verify with tough laws for the guilty parties (both illegals and the businesses that hire them).

4059,funny.... "alt-left eco-radicals" as you say... weren't those the same "crazy left hippies" who were saying the longer you wait to implement carbon reduction and pricing  the more it will cost down the line?    Almost like they knew what they were talking about... as though  perhaps they aren't "alt-left eco-radicals" or "hippies" at all... but rather scientists and economists who knew how to crunch numbers and develop forecasting models.   Geez... if only it was plainly obvious 30 years ago and someone said something...  Sigh.,?
4060,The little crap wagons are garbage and no good for anything. You can't get in or out of them  and you'd freeze to death in them in the winter. These carbon taxes have killed thousands of senors in the UK who can no longer afford to heat their homes. Trudeau  Butts and the rest of the murdering   genocidal     killers he's gather around him will hang for this.,?
4061,My impression of him is that he's an arrogant  conceited punk but that's based purely on the sledgehammer incident  crying about getting beat up by a kid  the look on his face in the photo above and his admitting he's not really going to do ANYTHING for the people of Hawaii this session (yet  collect a salary).  Fair? Unfair? Just my take on the guy.,?
4062,The problem with the government's climate change policy is that while the government is focused on one particular potential threat  the government is unprepared for other threats - for example  the opioid drug addiction crisis.  Also  it is likely that there will be a world wide disease epidemic in the near future.  How prepared is the government for that contingency?  Not only could there be an epidemic that affects people's health  there could an epidemic of plant diseases that create food shortages.  There are millions of acres of food crops that are planted with genetically identical corn  soybeans  and other crop plants ( "monoculture" ).  Being genetically identical  all the plants could be destroyed by one disease.  Our political leaders are vocal about the benefits of "diversity" when it comes to people.  They are completely silent on the lack of diversity in food crops - which suggests that they do not have an understanding of the full range of threats that Canadians may face.,?
4063,You really do not have any understanding of how things work.  Venture capitalists fund promising work after it has been developed and they figure they can make a profit from it.  they do not fund the basic research from the beginning.   Governments fund basic research all over the world...where do you think companies like Apple  Google  Pfizer and others started  or buy their next areas of growth from?,?
4064,Eugene  shame on you.  You don't know what you're talking about. The Trump is not a train.  He is the tide.

4070,My opinion is that every person is equal before the law  and therefore everyone's vote should count for the same amount. Why should anyone's vote be more important than the vote of any other person? Do you see that written into the Constitution  that a voter in Wyoming  wherever she may have been born  has three times the value of a woman in California?  Maybe you thought you were making a joke  but we live in the real world  where disenfranchisement is rampant  and causes serious damage  like the election of a mentally unstable president who lies about everything and uses his office to fill his hotels.,?
4071,Pierce's letter reads EXACTLY like that of a paid PR firm employee that may have been hired by useless  ethicless  part-time mayor Crapwell.,?
4072,"GOP base"??? Oh garbage!  Democrat Sen. Robert Byrd was a KKK- Klan member. Robert C. Byrd served 51 years in the United States Senate  longer than anyone else in history. He joined the Klan when he was 24 years of age because he noted that during WWII he might have to fight alongside what he called “race mongrels  a throwback to the blackest specimen from the wilds”. During Byrd's funeral Hillary Clinton praised Sen. Robert Byrd as her "mentor  a man of eloquence and nobility". If anyone needs pictures of Hillary Clinton kissing and hugging KKK member Byrd I can provide those link's easy enough.  BTW. You might want to spend time reading the Democrat National Committee e-mails that Wiki-Leaks proved. Those e-mails are filled with racist  homophobic  bigoted  misogyny  anti Semitism remarks. Talk about a political party base of Dark Jacka***!,?

4078,Elton John should sue Donald for using "Rocket Man". Damn DOTARD.,?
4079,The left will try any lie  to stop themselves from owning up for their murdering ways. If they think the people who democratically put Trump in power will lay down while the left rapes the working man  I'll be laughing my azz off  while all the crap comes down. I'll sit back and enjoy watching their fairy tale world  implodes.,?
4080,I won't go as far as saying hopelessly stupid  not even close.  The right wing scream machine has done a masterful job since at least the Clinton administration of creating a propaganda environment where the so called conservatives believe  and I mean truly believe that they are the only arbiters of what is patriotic and American.  They believe that their way of life is somehow being destroyed and that liberals are the root of all evil in this country.  It isn't stupid  it is propaganda that is aimed at people who are already dissatisfied with something in society or their own lives  that propaganda gives them somewhere to place the blame for everything wrong with this country or their own lives.  Stupid  no  not at all  but fed a diet of lies for decades  absolutely.  Unfortunately  Trump is the result of 30 years of those lies.,?
4081,Naturally it's all about how it feels on the tongue.,?
4082,I went to my local walk in clinic a few years back when I was working 60 hour weeks at my high pressured salaried job. Having experienced bronchitis in the past when the humidity drops in the fall and I get run down  I could tell that what was mild bronchitis had likely progressed into pneumonia. The attending physician said no  it's bronchitis and gave me a prescription. Two days later I was MUCH worse and returned to see a different attending physician who changed the diagnosis to pneumonia and changed the treatment. Anyone can get it wrong  doctors included  and quoting low probability alternate diagnoses as 'proof' while POTENTIALLY accurate  there is NO guarantee that the outcome would be different. I can pass on other experiences that occurred with my parents (a general surgeon/family physician treating my father for a cardiac condition and a family history of heart disease)  but bottom line  quality care is dependent on the individual. Doctors need to get over the scare tactics.,?

4086,"The US is a stupid  contemptible country with no dominant ethnicity and no culture and the whole world rightly despises it and its people."

4092,If you honestly think that your posts consist primarily of facts  rather than opinions supported neither by logic nor empirical data  then perhaps you could get a job at the Washington Post or CNN as a fact-checker.,?
4093,In a recollection from the past  I remember this debate about which place - Hawaii or Guam - was about to get a boatload of military development due to the rising threats in Asia. I remember this discussion happening in and around the year 2000  sixteen years ago. I also remember at the time Sen. Inouye trying to lobby the navy brass to headquarter a nuclear aircraft carrier in Hawaii  where it was destined for Guam.   So this news is not "new" in the context of Guam seeing more military development. What is new is the progress that has been made in the 16 years to fully headquarter all the services in Guam.,?

4095,So  since the wars are over  the cruise missile attack into Afghanistan which killed the leader of the Taliban last week must be a war crime .  It was specifically authorized by President Obama according to his press secretary.  What other justification is there for killing an Afghani leader in negotiations with the Pakistani government to cease hostilities while he is driving through Pakistan after receiving medical attention in Iraq if it is not during a 'war'?    And the cruise missile attacks into Yemen to support the Saudis and the daily bombings in Iraq from Italy by our Air Force and from our aircraft carriers are also post-war atrocities.    No.  Tom  the wars are not over  just being conducted with different weapons and fewer deaths---at least of our people.  You are doing a Bill Clinton - trying to define a word so it meets your needs  not the reality recognized by non-believers.  "I did not have sexual relations with that woman!"    These are not 'wars'!  Ludicrous. Pathetic,?
4096,You don't count. Freddy  the arrogant  pompous donkey can attack with impunity  but is critical of anyone who posts an opposing or differing view.,?
4097,hopefully they forgot to buy return tickets,?
4098,Again  cite research that shows your claims. "I went up a hill once and studs were better" isn't research. Because Blizzaks outperform in the studies I've seen. And as somebody else mentioned  they are NOT the same as all season. Bridgestone recommends they be used only in winter months and does not claim them to be an all season tire. Very different things.,?
4099,We don't need to worry. Only prepare.  Not only is the Orange blob a bully  he is ignorant and chaotic. He doesn't care about the facts  only the politics and his crooked ideology. Shouldn't be too hard to run rings around the clown.,?
4100,I don't know why governments don't just throw open the books. Everyone expects the worst from governments anyway so why disappoint people?,?
4101,Why do we want to be like California? They just past Single-Payer and it is going to cost 400 Billion Dollars a year and they did not figure a way to pay for it. Just for the record California total budget each year is only 180 billion Dollars. So this would increase the yearly budget by 225%. This why we cannot afford  support or do some stupid like single payer!!!,?
4102,Trump is a traitor and vile human being far worse than the leader of North Korea.,?
4103,he was demoted due to he is a idiot !! if its communication skills our Blunder boy with all his umm and ahhs should be next Blunder boy is just trying to take the heat off all the other issues with this goverment,?
4104,Liar.  Really pisses you off that Obama's black huh?,?
4105,Nonsense.  You seem to be suffering from a election loss mental disorder.,?
4106,Crazy to trust ropes out in he woods.,?
4107,That is so typical and funny. I get a comment deleted for an actual civil comment and those on the left are hardly affected for continuous ad hominem personal attacks about almost every republican/conservative commentator and I need to be careful? The word "troll" is bandied about with regularity on here by many  on both sides. I use it to describe someone who cannot debate with logical arguments or facts. One who  when the facts are not in their favor  constantly change the subject or direction of the debate. Or who make statements that constantly show them to not want civil debate but to create a hostile environment among the commenters. If you fit both of those descriptions  so be it.,?
4108,Yeah  you guys got screwed.,?
4109,what a ridiculous statement. Lets see the medical proof that the vaccine caused the child to be in a wheelchair. You won't find any because it doesn't exist.  I support your view that the education system and the educators in Canada are sub par  but that is as far as I can go.  You people making pseudo-claims of scientific fact. I hope your daughter never has sex with someone who has HPV. That will be a tough pill of irony to swallow and your daughter will have your ignorance to thank.  Go back to school and learn how to discern between fact and opinion. Stay off the internet.  There is no medical case or evidence that points to the HPV virus causing paralysis or whatever you are claiming. The medical community would report it and it would be removed from use. Do you honestly believe that the entire medical community in Canada and the US would keep quiet if what you were blabbering was true???  Come back to reality and take your tin hat off.,?
4110,Trump's EPA is allowing coal companies to dump their coal debris into America's rivers and streams.  They are allowing our food to be sprayed with chlorpyrifos pesticide  a chemical known to interfere with brain development in fetuses and infants  even when ingested in minuscule amounts.  As the American Academy of Pediatrics put it  "The risk to infant and children's health is unambiguous." Elections have consequences and Trump's characterization of Obama's fixation on clean drinking water and protecting the health of infants and children clearly resonated.  The New York billionaire's campaign promise was not just to rid the land of Obamacare; it was to replace it with a beautiful plan that offered better coverage at lower costs and included every American.  The Congressional plans Trump has endorsed would be an absolute betrayal of his campaign promise. Yes  there are many things about America worth celebrating.  Unfortunately  many things also to decry.,?
4111,Wwwhhat? Of course it needs to be talked about! It has medicinal qualities we are not even aware of yet because of lack of research because it was illegal! Marijuana is in the shadow of alcohol and needs to get far more daylight as far superior and less dangerous than alcohol!,?
4112,Get a grip and use your brain. It's not about killing fish. It's about killing the fishery. Are you always so ignorant  or just mean?,?
4113,So for congressional members and their staff the ACA plan does cost more  72% MORE than the FEHB plan.  And it's only 72% because the FEHB plan's premium is low compared to most other plans.  If it had been more than 100% then they would have felt some pain like other people who are paying 100%  200%  300%  etc. more than what they were paying.  Too bad they can't be subsidised.,?
4114,Too bad he couldn't have just shot himself  lowlife thug.,?
4115,Good to know that the Alaska Republican Party officially condones racism  anti- Muslim and anti-Mexican statements  and misogynistic statements- including lots of disgusting comments about women before the so -called "locker room tapes" became public.   Good luck with that.,?
4116,A crazy Texan with a gun. I'd sure like to see the overtime cost on this one.,?
4117,It's a shame the PM didn't use that "professional merit" yard-stick to measure up potential cabinet candidates. What played a big part  in those decisions  was head-counting the gender representation. That's the "quota" mentality  plain and simple. But  benefit of the doubt...maybe there just weren't that many "professional merit" individuals elected. (And what does THAT say?)  But  then again  the PM is certainly a man for his times. When 50% of respondents judge him "Charismatic "  43% call him "Modern" and another 31% call him "compassionate" as the TOP THREE identifiers (from a list of 24  including everything from "bumbling" to "transparent") you know Canada gets what it deserves. (Source: Angus Reid poll  Sept 2017),?
4118,Question to Melissa Quinn - why is Sally Yates' Twitter account "news"?  I can point to many other Twitter accounts of private citizens with their own opinions.  Are they news also?  I think there needs to be some boundary as to what actually constitutes "a news story" versus what we recently would have called "random online gossip."  The line continues to be blurred and I don't think that is good for the news media.,?
4119,Why does the Guard print this garbage?,?
4120,I wonder?  Would the mayor release all of his addresses and Facebook messages to allow us to determine that all of his City Business conversations fall into line with the laws that are in place to ensure that City Business is not conducted in a manner so as to keep the citizens of Langley unaware of what is really going on in council?  The term is known as straw polling and in most places that's illegal.   Legal or not it certainly violates public trust even if nothing significant was going on.,?
4121,You're the racist troll trying to copy other people's accounts.  Flagging all your copycat accounts.,?
4122,I dont believe that true; if a conservative argument in favor of single payer can be postulated  then people will listen. Democratic leadership shut down the discussion due to Industry lobbyists  not practicality.,?

4124,Thanks to our government in Ottawa for once again making the shelves in stores safe for imports from countries where they use massive amounts of coal.  Peace continues to reign over the once very noisy former  industrial heartland of Ontario (and Quebec too - but at least they have cheap hydro power as an alternative to fossil fuel).,?
4125,Do you know what the marketplace is?  It's basically the website where people can go to shop plans.  It has absolutely nothing to do with actually providing insurance or m focal services.  It's sad that you think success is running a profitable website that is funded by a premium tax on all of the policies sold there as well as other government funding.,?
4126,Dave  I can pretty much guarantee you that Justin Trudeau didn't celebrate the bicentennial by boning up on Ricardo's oeuvre either.  Don't you think there is something wrong that it is Trump  not Trudeau  who is saying how he would like NAFTA changed  and Trudeau is just reacting After all  Trudeau already had his trade team in place for about a year before Trump was ever elected  while Trump still hasn't even got his official trade representative confirmed yet.,?
4127,Same moronic comments from the usual neocon  chickenhawk warmongerers since 2003.  Why don't you just close your threads ?  It's not like your paper actually stands for freedom of speech and expression.  In fact  you seem to stand for nothing.,?
4128,Richard says "All JT did was not cancel it after it was already signed." I ask "Why can't JT cancel it. He is the PM with a Majority government?",?

4135,I am wondering whether Krista knows that in 2009  declawing was legally ban in eight California cities: West Hollywood  Los Angeles  San Francisco  Burbank  Santa Monica  Berkeley  Beverly Hills and Culver City. If she does  has she spent some time before writing this article to do a good journalistic work by examing those cities' animal shelter before and after data? If she did  she would find herself deadly wrong. No  declaw ban does not flood animal shelters with cats!,?
4136,Or  in layman terms  your just a blowhard.,?
4137,Trump warns McCain?  What's he gonna do?  Torture McCain with Twitter?  Threaten him with bone spurs?  Had the coward  draft-dodging Trump had any intestinal fortitude to serve his country  much less spend time in a POW camp and survive  he'd know what respect of others is.  Instead  he's just a loud-mouthed coward hiding behind a twitter account  lies  and back-pedaling.,?
4138,Yep  think we should have Caldwell pay for the rail himself.  From the start I figured it would take at least $10B ... now to get to Ala Moana ... probably more like $20B.  And ... we still won't have the riders to pay for the daily upkeep.  Oh so sad ... Caldwell is an idiot!!!,?

4142,Dammit George   you're making me thirsty.,?
4143,You are completely right but it does not excuse her hypocrisy.  She will accept her subsidized education as a wet behind the ears Canadian kid  but is she asking her parents who are complicit in the colonization by moving here to move back to the ME (or wherever)?   After all they are not living in Halifax but on Miqmaq land.   Perhaps it is time she walked the walk.   And no!!  I do not want or expect her to leave....just grow up.,?
4144,Everybody should take all scratches and skin breaks seriously. Quickly wash it with soap and water  apply Neomycin-Bacitracin antibiotic ointment from Long's and generously cover it with a big bandage. Change them everyday and reevaluate the healing process. Pus or clean? These things are cheap insurance. you never know if your kid has a weak immune system. Hospitals are overwhelmed and full of stupid uncaring doctors  nurses  and support workers mixed up with good ones. This kind of accident will continue again and again. I strongly suspect people didn't care because they saw them as inferior people from the Pacific regions. The award should have been $10 million  and people should have been fired. That was a human child who died. Who will be the next one? A white one?,?
4145,Sounds like we need new leadership across the board. Young has been in power for what 40 sum/odd yrs?! Don't tell me we are getting our resources worth from those oil company shills. Bet healthcare and AK's deficeit are lining tesoros coffers while they smile.,?
4146,what year did you move to Canada? Your ignorance is astounding!,?
4147,What a way to celebrate my dog Kingy's birthday!  A crash-em-up derby involving a self-driving vehicle.,?
4148,It is hard for me too  especially when they are my own family. I meant only to offer explanation rather than defense.   The problem is fixing itself in Iowa and elsewhere. The rural population continues to shrink and the urban population is growing. Those who think like my father are dying off and not being replaced.   Even though gerrymandering and the Electoral collage give disproportionate power to rural areas right now  the population decreases in those areas cannot be stopped. The sheer numbers will eventually overwhelm the inherent rural bias of those systems.   Trump is the last desperate gasp of the regressive true believers. They will be overwhelmed by the demographics and be sad little enclaves of hate  fear  and ignorance.,?
4149,Holy crap an actual NAMBLA member. Terrifying.,?
4150,No  I don't mean MSW. I wish I could recall the name of the man whom I have in mind. I'll try to do so. Point being that NCR were obviously (in that instance) inviting a view opposite to the 'usual' one. And I'm sure there have been other similar instances.,?
4151,And the rest of the Judges  who hide their obvious political bias keep on working. I am astonished that this would be an issue in a Canadian court.,?
4152,Give me a break. Trumps only decision is that he is bound and determined to do away with anything Obama did. He has made that clear because that's the case with every single thing he's done. He's too stupid to actually sit down and think and discuss with people new and thoughtful programs. He's a brainless twit who couldn't add 2+2 without a calculator. Bill Maher was right all along - he's the offspring of an orangutan.,?
4153,Yes  Klastri  right as always.  The event was promoted as a Free Speech Rally; there was nothing to indicated it was a pro-Trump  pro-Nazi or some such thing  yet you are confident that the 15 000 or more so-called “counter protesters” were there because Trump is a Nazi sympathizer.  You must think the people who read your comments are imbeciles.,?
4154,What a jerk the guy is.,?
4155,Uncle Ted Stevens took the fall for his son Ben just like Bill Allen took the fall for his two kids that should have been indicted.  Ben was one of the founding members of the Corrupt Bastards Club making $100 k a year from Veco for a no show job.  Corrupt to the bone.  Alaskans will not forget.,?
4156,You prove my point that it is a matter of personal judgement  you don't think that 'certain' person is a troll  I do think he is. I'll grant you he is ostensibly civil but his aim is to pour scorn on and subtly abuse orthodox Catholic posters. Yet for all that I do not flag him nor do I mute him just because I think his comments are generally pathetic.,?
4157,Makes sense to me.,?
4158,Right. It's more like he's got entire departments of the U.S. government seeing red now that he's scuttled important  planned negotiations with one self-serving  undisciplined and stupid tweet.,?
4159,The blacks are the ones that are racists. They hate white people and do not hesitate to let them know that fact. Ridiculous waste of time and energy in this article. Just trying to make white people feel guilty once again for slavery..which is really stupid.,?

4161,"He was denied access to any 'accredited' school..."  You mean he didn't teach at Princeton?  And he received his Pd.D. from the University of Zurich in 1905.  His theses adviser was Alfred Kleiner.  You might try getting a grip on facts before posting such blatant "alternative facts".,?
4162,Give it a break on helping students  everyone and their brother use this to pass another tax  we heard all the excuses after wards of why the money will not help students.

4182,yes ...a city or whoever has a responsibility to hire the best employee to fill any position - that employee  including engineers  have the responsibility for doing their correct  best work (and keeping their license current)  the contractors have a responsibility to do the work properly and as contracted  motorists have the responsibility to use the roads lawfully and safely..as do bikers and pedestrians.  of course that is in a perfect world  but it doesn't take much effort  or common sense  to look after ourselves better.  nobody is going to cover your butt as well as you can yourself because nobody has as much to lose.  and of course   doing the best that can be done  stuff happens.  amazing instances of wrong place  wrong time tragedies. and instances of amazing indifference.,?

4188,“We’re basically a giant sports bar that cares about weather ”  Bingo!  That's a HUGE reason I usually don't watch local newscasts.  I don't care about sports and I only care how cold or hot it is or if it's going to snow where I'm going to be so I check the forecast on the internet and I look outside for immediate conditions.  "They have their laptops  tablets and phones out while they’re watching something on television."  Right again and one thing I've always hated about local news is they'll tease a story during the show prior to the broadcast but of course they'll just hint at how interesting it is.  They'll keep teasing it and teasing it and finally near the end of the news you find out it wasn't that interesting at all.   Now if they tease a story like that 5 seconds on Google will tell me all I want to know (usually).  It's also interesting that AFAIK  9News is the only one to have bothered to have a Roku channel.,?

I negotiate each year with my employer and so far I've had a fair deal every time with one exception. with that one  I was out of there the next week and never looked back.   Note: Ive been in the workforce for more than forty years and one of these days i will be tired of it and decide to retire.

4203,diverdave  You assume that the executive order would work  but the Trump administration presented little evidence that it would reduce the risk of terrorism.

You will no longer be able to rent your children out to police as bait in abuse investigations  and your husband will have a lot more competition as a gigolo.  When there are no longer real people working at real jobs  who will be paying off the Federal debt  provincial debt  municipal taxes  mortgages?  Do you think the wealthy will simply say "ok  we will pay that off?"  There is a tremendous amount of conflict coming  within this generation  to western "G20" countries.,?

4208,None of this really matters.   Beth Tokioka will easily be appointed by votes from Mel Rapozo and Ross Kagawa. Arryl Kaneshiro and KipuKai Kuali'i will  as usual  fall in line right behind them.   All of this serves as a huge mahalo to the AgriChem Cartel that Beth works for and which is provides big money to keep poisoning Kaua'i in the name of the all mighty dollar.   It really doesn't matter how JoAnn Yukimura  Gary Hooser or Mason Chock decide to vote  because they continue fighting with one hand tied behind their backs thanks to the AgriChem Cartel who seriously do not care about anyone or anything other than money and the search for a better chemical at any cost.

4219,Cry me a river more about things that are not your business.  You eat meat  you are a giant hypocrite. Stop getting hung up on the word  “sport.”   Very few people kill animals for sport here in Colorado. Most hunters hunt for meat.  You hunt in a supermarket. You eant to talk anout healthy meat and cruelty?   Bring it. Just quit posturing like you are some moral superstar  it is disgusting.,?

4226,If Pope Francis came out with a loud  unequivocal  "Yes  AL most certainly does say that the divorced and remarried can receive the Sacraments  be fully integrated into the life of the Church and still live as man and wife." Wouldn't that be just what you wanted to hear  wouldn't it suit your purpose down to the ground? All he has done is to stay tight-lipped  dropping hints in private letters and allowing people like Spadaro to be taken as speaking for him.  Why doesn't he admonish the Polish and other bishops who are adamant that the divorced and remarried cannot receive the Sacraments whilst simultaneously committing adultery?  Have you asked yourself why? Our Lord was forthright in His teaching   now we have a Magisterium of a nod here  a wink there.,?
4227,Term Limits  it's easy to talk tough when sitting in your easy chair listening to the know nothing experts say no sweat. You have zero experience with all the firepower you are referring to and 'scheduled testing' of that firepower versus the real thing is the difference between day & night. If you trust the political party to tell the truth or put your fate in their hands  you are or will be a dead idiot. Don't you think NK has thought about those simple game theories you think are so great.,?

4236,"To hear Conway tell it  some combination of Mother Teresa and the Dalai Lama has been hiding in plain sight all along  except that somehow  Trump's unruly mouth failed to properly represent Trump's saintly heart and it's all your fault  anyway  for believing words and actions have meaning. The trouble is  inconvenient realities like this one insist on telling a different story. Indeed  the Kovaleski case is the whole tragedy of Donald Trump in microcosm: the scorn  the bullying  the pettiness  the lying  the self-delusion."   Perfect example of the typical conservative response to  well  everything: "it's not me  it's you. Be responsible for the garbage that comes out of my mouth." And my all time favorite " Trump was elected because of You/Clinton/Obama."  Seriously?  Seriously!?,?
4237,Betsy Devos cannot be the best we can do for Education in the US. Find a better nominee  not one who has been given the nomination because of her huge donations to the Trump campaign. We have seen enough confusion and lack of proper planning in the last two weeks. We don't need another inexperienced  unknowledgable person extending chaos and confusion at the education department. Change and improvements are fine  but she is not the person to do that. Her agenda is too extreme.  The disability community is watching this vote and Senator Sullivan  we are looking to you for leadership  not just party loyalty. Senator Murkowski is on the right side of history on this vote. Where will you end up?,?

4242,Why would people be 'uneasy'? Did they not voter for higher deficits and debts? Did they not vote for more access to the public purse? Did they not decide that money can be raised simply by taxation and borrowing? Did they not vote for more entitlements for themselves and others? Given that they are getting what they voted for  why  indeed  are they now uneasy about the economy?,?
4243,The purpose of the ACA was to put more people at the government teat and change insurance from a risk based assessment to a subsidized and forced enrollment paid for by those at less risk and higher earnings. In that regard it was a success. Sadly  it should have been a mechanism to lower costs and it did exactly the opposite- as planned  IMO. How better to impose control while your cronies rake in?,?

4251,Bah... My final comment last nite got snagged..."did not meet" Funny as it was simply an expression of frustration at why you would not give an opinion about  all that late day ENB trading...

4260,I  too  have a dash-cam installed  front AND rear-facing.  It's already paid for itself from claims that something was my fault  when it wasn't. But without video proof  it becomes a he-said she-said issue.  Insurance companies don't care.  Your own carrier simply charges you more  because YOU couldn't prove you're innocent.  I've even switched insurance carriers when they wouldn't agree my video evidence was enough.  Fortunately  the courts agreed with me. An interesting outcome  is that I think I am driving more carefully WITH the dash-cam.  So it's a win-win for everyone.  Except the ones who get caught being stupid......,?
4261,Thanks for coming out.,?
4262,This is the Justice who compared the ACA to the purchase of broccoli. Seriously? She is off her rocker. Quote from the ACA:  "According to the Government  upholding the individual mandate would not justify mandatory purchases of items such as cars or broccoli because  as the Government puts it  “[h]ealth insurance is not purchased for its own sake like a car or broccoli; it is a means of financing health-care consumption and covering universal risks.” Reply Brief for United States 19. But cars and broccoli are no more purchased for their “own sake” than health insurance. They are purchased to cover the need for transportation and food." Ginsburg,?
4263,Yes  instead of dealing with the problem let's just modify human behavior in a human habitat and give up more to the problem wildlife that we've coddled and enabled by no longer hunting on our outskirts. Coastal Trail next  as that's now "bear country" too. 🙄,?

4266,it is interesting that when Trump builds a building he uses foreign labour and Chinese steel.

4286,Yes  it's mean. He was given several lifetime sentences. I agree with that; it is just but I don't agree that separating him from his father is just. There's no good reason for it. It's just a mean thing to do and in my opinion  reflects poorly on the court. Nor do I agree with the court  that "there are no more serious crimes than the ones he committed."  What about torturing  raping and killing a baby? I can think of thousands of crimes that are more serious and worse in every way.,?

4293,I dearly hope that your forecast turns out to be true; that the Dems gain the upper hand in the mid-term. I fear this is however unlikely. My forecast is that Trumpers (i.e. Bannon) is organizing a Trumper Party which will put its candidates up against GOP and Dem candidates. Given the 40% support Trumpers have they will elect quite a few into Congress who will likely hold the balance of power and give legitimacy to Trump administration.  It is a sad and dangerous situation developing South of the border that will impact Canada very adversely.,?

4296,Mueller isn't credible. This arrest  and especially the LEAKING of this arrest last Friday really shows the desperation of this investigation. He was hired to investigate COLLUSION by TRUMP with RUSSIA. Not some collusion by manafort in 2008 with the Dems.   I mean  good for Mueller making an arrest at all  but it seemed more engineered to save his own skin than anything else. Mueller was desperate to show he was finding something  anything.,?

Not mentioned in this article but I assume willbe reviewed by the current government is which of these 312 cases were legitimate cases of fraud in applications - certainly not Mr Gucake's  it would be a bit much to revoke a son's ctizenship because his father lied about his own background!

4321,According to the June 2106 CAPP Executive Summary report on "Crude Oil Forecast  Markets and Transportation"  if Enbridge Line 3  Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain and Keystone XL are built  the total capacity of the major pipelines exiting the WCSB will reach more than 5.8 million barrels per day (M b/d). The Western Canadian crude oil supply forecast for 2030 is expected to reach around 5.4 M b/d (supply includes production and diluent imports).  There is no need for more pipelines exiting Western Canada. There will be enough capacity to carry Canadian crude oil to the American market where the existing capacity to refine Canada's heavy crude oil is already available. Actually  Canadian oil producers are allowed to use U.S. port facilities to export their crude oil (if not mixed with U.S. oil products) to other countries. In July 2014  exports reached 874 260 barrels in total  the most ever exported in "one month"(Globe and Mail  Nov. 02  2014: "Oil Sands Crude Reaching Europe  Asia").,?

To rot from the inside-out because someone will make some money off of a treatment that would save your life or well-being? Of note  vaccines are some of the least profitable medications produced by the pharmaceutical industry.  There are some flaws in your presentation: - doctors do not get paid extra to prescribe medication in Canada; none of the doctors I have ever worked with have ever received any form of kickback. - if you had a condition that required medicine  and the medicine didn't work  then why would the medicine even be prescribed? - in the same vein  though you don't directly reference the article  you assume that "Big Pharma" and  by association  physicians  have a vested interest in your return visit... wouldn't the same apply to naturopaths  who directly charge the patient for much of their services  rather than provincial medical insurance bodies?,?

4343,I am always interested in these things   so please provide the name of the province that took the deal or provinces  while the rest held out. As I understand it the deal was for ten years and it was to continue the 6 % from the Martin years and then revert to 3% after two years. Both the Harper government and now the Trudeau government would be aware of the PBO's report that said that healthcare costs would be expected to grow by 4.9% for the next twenty or thirty years because of the aging population. The Liberals at the time of the Harper announcement were livid that Harper was putting the burden onto the provinces  and cited the report as evidence. Now it seems 3% is just fine. Anyway provide the list of provinces who didn't take the deal of 6% and held out for more which is what is happening now.,?
4344,Well Obama did his job.  You have convienantly forgotten that He draged this country from the worst economic recession since the great depression.

4345,The worrying thing for liberals should be the skyrocketing approval of Trump's picks for cabinet officers so far. While the left wing media goes apoplectic  the rank and file American highly approves of his selections so far. When the economy takes off  which it will within the first year of his presidency  and his accomplished selections for cabinet posts perform admirably  which they will  the 2018 and 2022 elections may be a wipeout from which the Democrats may never recover.,?

You  Sir ain't got no clue to the truth!   Trump not a racist  rofl!  "Don't freak out" you tell me!  No I ain't black  but I'm a woke white boy!  Don't blame me for you being blind!   Jesus is a glorious God and he shows me the truth  and revels the darkshadows of the lies before me!  Get right with the glory and you will see the light!  We are brothers and sisters the dark and the light!  We must pray forgiveness for the sins the we do and the lies that we make! You defend Trump and say I read too much into it???  I'm trying to show you the truth!!! We all sit blind to the truth and we all spend too much time looking stupid!  Find that truth!,?
4349,The delusional  mentally impoverished  pathological liar just can't quit. How long before this malignant narcissist continues his rantings is the time it takes to remove him from his presidential playpen. His chief sycophant and apologist  Paul Ryan  says "He's just learning". Learning to lie or learning to be president? Either one is a fool's errand.,?
4350,Your opinion doesn't count  only the statute wording - plain & simple. Stupid cannot be cured.,?
4351,Actually no  Poll after poll showx most of the world sees the usa as the largest threat to world peace,?

4353,Delays caused by defence counsel are not counted in the computation of unreasonable delay.  Try again?,?
4354,Unbelievable that after taking two young lives that this idiot was given back his right to drive! Now he is right back out there endangering people again. He needs to go to jail for a LONG time and NEVER be allowed to drive again.,?
4355,1500 additional migrants in all of 2016.  A mere 1500.  And the numbers still WAY BELOW what we saw in the late 2000s.  Someone is feeding people lies and riling them up over this false issue.,?
4356,I just knew that johann would be unable to objectively read this article without bringing up the president. JZs obsessive hatred of and disdain for Trump and posting negative comments about him no matter the subject matter of the articles is now bordering on manic obsessive and idiotic.,?
4357,Trump is an oaf  with no regard for others nor the slightest hint of dignity.,?
4358,Rep. Thielen if you and you colleagues in the House feel "Enough is Enough" then stop anymore funding request by the Mayor or the City Council. Mayor Caldwell is on the path to bankrupting the City and County of Honolulu and if the legislature gives in to the mayor's demands every legislator risk bankrupting the State too. This a project that has run amok and mayor Caldwell will continue to seek more increases in taxes and fees on the State level as long as the legislature continue to allow the the mayor to go unchecked. You're correct in tour assessment  "ENOUGH IS ENOUGH",?
4359,Good  there should be no payday for this traitor from a family of traitors...,?
4360,He is just a complacent  arrogant Canadian - forgive him.,?
4361,His friend beat the Delaware criminal justice system.... murder charges dropped and he was set free. Now he's trying to help his friend using same concept  poor black man. He is stupid..... made comment to media that when Smith was arrested for assault  made him cut his hair after that incident  BUT on the night of the shooting he had his dreads intact  that was one of the IDing charateristics. If cut his hair after  shooting makes his friend a co-conspriter.,?
4362,"may have come closer.." and you want to know why the american people hate the news media. HILLARY CLINTON IS A TRAITOR. BUT SHE WILL NOT BE PUNISHED. There are IN FACT two sets of rules  two sets of laws  two sets of justice in america. THE RULING PARTY IS IN COMPLETE CONTROL  AND believe me when i say that Donald Trump is NOT in control of the ruling party. We are out of time....you know it.....i know it.....we all know it  so the grinners grin  the liars lie  cheaters cheat. You? You go to work  or try to  and .....heheh.

4365,But the emails...WHINE...,?
4366,Religion is a very personal thing. I don't care if my neighbours worship God or the Tooth Fairy provided that they don't force me to follow suit and that they obey our civil laws. To do that requires the state to have no religion.. .,?

4369,Wow. You are just a silly little troll.,?
4370,Trump is delusional.  He thinks that he can operate the government the way that he ran his business.  He might be able to see how that has worked so far.  He remains completely ignorant of the other two branches of government.  His administration is a failed  hot mess.  He'll never recover from the first disastrous 110 days.,?
4371,hey shore you liberal shilling hack ANSWER the question!!  why not let people choose? answer: cause liberal fascist think they know best what to shove down our throats   well guess what lib  in 2019 with bs like this we will be able to rid canada of you fascists for good along with horrible policies like this,?
4372,Thanks for clarifying that! Sounds like the crop on other birds?,?
4373,No rate increases.  Sounds like Lawson is doing what he was hired to do.  And  there’s still people complaining about it.  Sounds right on par for Eugene.  Good job so far Mr. Lawson,?

4385,A false analogy - apples and orangutans.,?
4386,WTF people? Who are these heartless bastards that have such little disregard for human lives? Even if you aren't a fan of animals  the little boy watched his dog get hit and you drove off!! I can't wait until they publish your name in the paper so everyone will know exactly the kind of person you are. I would have immediately stopped  called 911 and blocked traffic with my SUV until I was able to get the child out of the road called his parents. This kid could have been hit next!! How horrible  selfish and thoughtless you are.   Let's find out who you are. I only hope karma comes quickly and you learn firsthand how it feels. You are a total douchebag. When karma comes  don't come crying  because honey  no one is coming to help you.,?
4387,You know what it means.,?
4388,In the Orient '0' lot line small houses are the norm rather than the exception. Appliance efficiency is amazing!,?
4389,Yeah...lots of scum and low-lifes from the land of fruits and nuts  our national looney bin  California  voted for the corrupt bitch and gave her a popular vote lead. Fortunately  that's not how te system works  and the Founders were wise to set up the Electoral College as a precaution to keep vermin like Hillary from ascending to the presidency...,?
4390,KPMG's license may or may not be cancelled. But they must be made to reveal the truth about the rogue unit and the devious activities they undertook at the behest of Rupert and his media associates.,?
4391,The malignant narcissist and mentally deranged sociopath has no credibility.,?
4392,It makes it clear that this is a fake news attack on Sessions.  Sessions made no comment on whether he met with a Russian.  He was speaking about the Trump campaign not himself.,?
4393,Not the same thing as the United incident. The dad is an idiot thinking that he gets to keep the seat because his son did not show up for the flight.  I'm glad airlines are serious about not letting anyone sit in a seat they didn't purchase.  Blame this one on the stupid dad  not the airline.,?
4394,Wish this clown would learn to speak English or pidgin.,?
4395,W:  You are truly pathetic.  What  10 comments on this board.  Get a life.  Also  if you want to talk history  remember your own.  The leafs have done  nothing for over 50 years.  Now  back to bed  the adults are talking.,?

4397,Anyone care to explain how Dusty Springfield could be considered "louche"? And  in the pantheon of great pop singers  please never leave out Karen Carpenter. Otherwise   thanks for the article on a great  great figure. Anne Murray would  show up on my list everywhere  every time.,?
4398,I'm not a builder but I know a house should not fall down  I'm not a race car driver but I know you are not supposed to crash  I'm not a surgeon but I know you want the patient to live  I'm not a cook but I'm pretty sure you don't want food poisoning from your meal.  And I also know that two officers under fire should be aiming for center mass  they missed and that is not a good thing.,?
4399,says a partisan freeloading shill who hides his identity..,?
4400,These bills speak to local government and school districts that negotiate pay and benefit increases  and bonuses  when facing mutimillion dollar deficits and then requesting millions to increase the BSA.  This is one way to slow down the growth in spending by the ASD. Thankfully we have a tax cap.,?
4401,This is great news  and despite the market being so high. It is driven by demand and could possibly not be an actual bubble.,?
4402,Just do away with the PFD and Alaska will once again become a better place to live.,?
4403,Paul Wolfowitz  Elliott Abrams  Richard Perle and Paul Bremer are all Republicans -- although at least two of them are 'converts'  going over to the Republican party to find a more comfortable home for their neo-conservative views.  I will grant  though  that the 'neoconservative' label does not divide neatly on the partisan line; Sec. Clinton's foreign policy views have had a neoconservative bent.  That's one of the ways in which Sen. Sanders pulled her to the left.,?
4404,SHHHH Don't let the truth out.. If it happened 101 years ago it shoots down that whole global warming thing,?
4405,Putin knew the Obama would have called him out on this!,?
4406,Great article Jon. I'm a long time MMA fan and it's great to hear your perspective as a fighter.  The current situation with MMA is very unfortunate  and the UFC paying a fraction of revenues to fighters sets a bad precedent for the industry.  It's also unfortunate that fighters aren't unionizing in a meaningful way to negotiate fair contracts. Until more fighters realize how underpaid they are and that others are profiting at their expense financially and in terms of their health  things won't change for the better.,?
4407,They had no evidence of wrong doing and they all covered for each other .now it's I will talk to try to save my own ass .,?
4408,Another paid political advertisement for Sullivan to counter the horrendous decisions recently made to throw all women under the bus of Supreme Court Dictatorship.  Federal dollars - military - Good; Federal dollars - society-Horrible.  The big lies of the Republican Terrorist Traitor Party as they hope the military will protect them against the rest of society fed up with war and military terror worldwide.  Republican Terror Traitor Party needs military to arm local law enforcement to quell all dissent as they loot the entire nation of its wealth and resources.  An Alaskan base absolutely "necessary" for foreign adventures in deserts.  Nice logic.  Disgusting stupidity.,?
4409,"Only for people from countries with birth records..." well dude  I hate to break this not news to you but every immigrant and citizen in this country has a birth record and most countries keep birth records - even some of the countries you view as backward - and have for hundreds of years.  Your comment that records were kept by illiterate people in churches is sheer HOGWASH.  I don't know why but you conservatives have this idea that cultures preceding our time were illiterate and contained no educated and literate people. Churches didn't employ illiterates to keep records you dope.  Good grief  I'm so tired of you idiots.,?
4410,Welp  at least now we know you're just a troll. lol,?
4411,Hillary  the sexual predator enabler who attempted to destroy her fornicator husband's victims. She shows her total disregard for women. She is a vile  conniving  disgusting user.,?

4413,Your Communist Muslim Terrorist Half White Ex-President is behind this.,?
4414,And you are the one who wants to eliminate anybody who does not agree with you. Its really the same sort of thinking. Intolerance. Bigotry. Pathetic,?
4415,Hey DannoBoy  best you read the report again.  The Report does not say all the things you post.  Are you posting Fake News?  The report says of all the reports to date  nothing is conclusive and a lot more scientific research must be made and replicated.  In fact  more current scientific research are providing negative effects on the human being.  Anyway  mahalo for posting the study.  Imua.,?
4416,Ask the bag lady where the 153 tons of gold went after the Libyan treasury was looted. Her and Harper destroyed the only stability in the region and turned the country over to ....ISIS. Our former muffin man of a PM was good for a global laugh after his 'victory' parade and flyover in Ottawa. Even Hillary wasn't that stupid and Obama called it the worst failure of his(Hillary's) government on his two term watch!,?
4417,wow! you are a pretty damaged human being.  1) those "vendors" at OCF  .. some of them make an incredible amount of money - you would wet yourself to see some of their dwellings. they're not on SNAP.. no outside subsidies. i have a friend who sells at OCF wearing marijuana leaves to cover her lady parts (google it   - you may not have ever seen them before..) - she is one of THE most successful (ie : wealthy) real estate agents in So. Cal. 2) robbing a bank? wearing ZZ top shades  hoodies? together ? no way. bank robber fashion faux pas.. one or the other.. #) then  "the old saying...."  and totally devolves into a rant on ducks...and birds... and dogs ...  ????     in all seriousness  - go get help..take the help that has probably been offered before. you are off the rails and i suspect you really need someone to talk to.. it's not what you have to say but the ways you get it out there. you stop any discussion - do you want to exchange ideas or just vent out a little hate at a time?,?
4418,thedingo8 You forgot to say "I believe",?
4419,The right to bear arms is an individual right.  There are no state militias.  What were once state militias have become the National Guard and the National Guard is under the control of the U.S. military.,?
4420,then please shut up  Hillary  and go back into your hole. you're not like Bill  get over it.,?
4421,Screw it  whats another 5%. Let them pay 100%. Another nonsense article. The middle income taxpayer floats this sinking boat. Don't let them fool you. It comes down to the number of taxpayers. A lot more of us fools than the wealthy.,?
4422,Can certainly understand why millions of Americans now want to emigrate here. says Rmiller  oh come on  it is all talk and no action especially from Hollywood celebrities let them put money where mouth is - cannot - foot is already in mouth  wanting to emigrate here - this is just trash talk,?
4423,No no  I get your point. The key to stop choking on burning trees is to stop logging them. Because logging them leads to chain saw exhaust and log truck exhaust and factories that use electricity and construction sites that use trucks to deliver the lumber and construction workers that drive pickups.  Once all these businesses are  eliminated the earth will go back to normal and trees will no longer burn. How long do I need to hold my breath?,?
4424,Where are all the stoneheads who assured us that this huge cash play would pay all the bills. Oh wait they were stoned when they typed their stupid comments,?
4425,Fat pussies?,?
4426,Hypocrite!  Crawl back into your hole.,?
4427,He11 just cut through the chase of the fog. The Democrats voted for a skin color in Obama and now they look to vote for a pair of ovaries in Clinton that =’s Political Correct idiots in over drive.,?
4428,As a man I feel the need to address this.  Go away little boy. You are not funny or witty and mansplaining to women how they should act is stupid at best and misoganistic at best.  Why don't you tell the father's to keep their junk soft? Why is it only the women's job  oh wait  that is right because men are just sex crazed machines right?   It takes two people to stop a pregnancy and acting like a big tough man telling women to keep their legs closed is so old school I think Instagram has a filter for it.,?
4429,sanctimonious wrote:  "The notion that only bad or ignorant people could have voted for Trump is false and divisive."  It's also a straw man.  There may have been one of two hot heads that claimed ALL Trumpians are bad or ignorant  but it's a claim not often heard.  That there are a distressingly large number of ignorant bigots is heard often.  It's hard to contradict.,?
4430,This reminds me of the city's failed S. Willamette rezoning proposal.  (SW-SAZ) The city became bogged-down from the upheaval and opposition from four city chartered neighborhood associations.  So  the city and mayor hired the Oregon Consensus who submitted their assessment.  The mayor didn't like the OC assessment  ignored it  and has now gone rogue and invited the entire community to her dog-and-pony-show of a forum.  To be heard September 19th.     The same with probably happen with an assessment of downtown.  The city will ignore the parts they don't like; the parts that will make them look like fools.,?
4431,Which is why they have those cute little steps to help you climb into your big boy truck. How adorable.,?
4432,I certainly agree in theory -- but I see none of the countries with the biggest stick every agreeing to comply  and I'm not surprised at the failure to negotiate.,?
4433,Must suck to be him to have to worry about a rogue boner popping up uncontrollably. What a laugh. Lawyers will think of anything to introduce doubt. The court recorder mustʻve had a tough time keeping a straight face. hahaha,?
4434,Wrong again.  Municipal employees are forced to join the state's pension system PERS.  There is no choice.  And munis are stuck with the incompetent decisions of state bureaucrats: bad investments losing millions and millions of dollars  telling munis not to contribute to PERS what they really should have then  oops better contribute after all.  I guess there could be no municipal employees but that isn't realistic.,?
4435,The defendant is very stupid and his lawyer is very smart in a cooked way. That is what lawyers are paid to do  whether the defendant is or isn't guilty. This should go to jail somewhere and keep him there. Rich spoiled kids is correct Pat and the DA is in Bowlen's pocket. What an embarrassment this DA is to the citizens of Arapahoe county,?
4436,If you enter Mellerstig on facebook a page will come up with lots of posts.  One of them says:  ‎Lauren Murphy‎ to PenAir 43 mins · Peoria  IL  United States ·  Jason Mellerstig recently moved to Anchorage to fly for PenAir.  Mellerstig shot a semi-automatic firearm in a residential neighborhood killing a family dog  a harmless chocolate lab on her own property. I for sure wouldn't want to get in an aircraft operated by a man so reckless  violent  unpredictable and with such little regard for living things. I hope PenAir re-considers the person they've hired...,?
4437,Part one of two- Ummm  you do understand that every time you read a online article by a web link 'posted by a stranger' ie  Denver Post in this case it is a link?

4438,NO.,?
4439,Why does this paper give the ink to that bozo commie Caplan. The Americans should put this dolt on the no fly list and ban him from entering the US.,?
4440,Is Donald Trump bad  mad – or both?  I don't know  but I do know this writer is an idiot.,?
4441,Ugly things happen in bars where disgruntled folks work out their personal frustrations on innocent patrons.  Remember a while back when a Chinese American  Vincent Chin  was celebrating his upcoming marriage at some Detroit bar.  Some ugly patrons mistakenly thought he was a working for competitor  Toyota  chased him and beat him to death with a baseball bat.  Things haven't changed much since then.  Alcohol and self pity will always bring out the worst in folks.,?
4442,You mean by the pussy.,?
4443,This jerk makes me never want to go to church again or give it one dime. What an American hating jerk  move to Russia if you hate America that much,?

4445,Hoist on your own petard Ruben? Just today you said "those who work for Trump are all legal immigrants"  Now you say Trumps hires "temporary non-agricultural workers". . Damn Ruben you should be White House communications director  you charge your story more often than Anthony Scaramucci.  . Admit it boy you got busted by a little old lady in sneakers.,?
4446,I'm afraid not.  I see far too many poorly researched news articles containing unsubstantiated information to believe any of the news sources understand what real journalism looks like. Politicians are allowed to spew one lie after another and those lies are printed without any fact-checking.  Other hard news stories are ignored in favor of shallow innuendo......real journalism is dead and most "journalists" don't even make an attempt at telling the whole story...they just sell a narrative.,?

4452,So take your Nazi salutes and your Confederate flags and your endless juvenile attempts at bogus equivalency insert them up your malodorous fundament as far as they will go. The responsibility for the 800 000 lives lost In the Civil War definitely does not rest with black people. Lincoln should have hanged Robert E. Lee.,?

4456,IF...McConnell has sex  it's the only thing he does quick!,?
4457,The Russians clearly "hacked" the elections  by doing the job the media used to do. (and still does when it comes to Republicans)  The rooskies  in fact  were so clever  they hacked the election in order to give Clinton a 2 million vote win...  Damn rooskies.,?
4458,So right-wing evangelicals are hypocrites? Shocking!,?

4464,Wow  check out the censorship here.  Seems that they dish it out  but certainly cannot take it.  No need to engage with the petrofascist hillbillies here.  There's no fixing stupid.,?
4465,Trump needs to be stopped. He is setting his government up as a dictatorship where all members are obedient to him and not the American people. The Senate and the House need to show some backbone and honour in stopping him.,?
4466,He is an embarrassment. The only thing worse is Clinton.,?
4467,Cut the Fat  I travel for work and see the misuse of our funds . Just like the building downtown to house the state   fixed it up with millions without permission and now we are hiring lawyers with our money made on bad decisions. Bad deals we are paying for because of a few!,?
4468,Anderson did not have his best outing  however he should never have seen that Oshie shot in the first place. That was a routine zone clearing error.  The Leafs versus Capitals is the tortoise versus hare. Namely Leafs put up constant pressure  whereas Capitals with some exceptions play in bursts and then go into cruise control.  What the Leafs are lacking  is a hard  accurate shot from point  the one timer  and clean passing up the neutral zone - which are all domains of the great defenseman.,?
4469,Name a group that is worse than Nazis.,?
4470,Ms Sanchez calling it like it is while t-rump unites the ignorant and uneducated in fascism.,?
4471,Well thats an interesting perspective. But its based on an incorrect premise. Governments (and religious organizations) have not tried to "broaden their education". They have tried to make them like immigrant Canadians....like the rest of us. I don't believe we can fault them for not wanting to be just like us. What do you think? If you have spent some time in a First Nations community  you will know their is much to critique  but there is also much to admire. From what I understand  they want to set their own path. We owe them our support in doing that.,?
4472,People are outraged because as  the republican sec of state Tillerson said  “Trump is f*cking moron”.  And it follows  so are his deplorables  lol & aloha,?
4473,Unfortunately  the 'weird pube beards' are part of their Islamic religion....just like killing infidels and unbelievers is.,?
4474,Whats the next title American,?
4475,LOL. So your response is that the Trump team is too negligent and stupid to recognize basic espionage techniques and respond? Negligence is a crime too.,?

4479,Deflection  you obviously did not address the error in your time-line lie.  You will be receiving you graduation diploma from the Kellyanne Conway school of public speaking shortly.  You can then take that undergrad diploma  and move on to get a graduate degree from Trump U.  Be prepared for higher tuition fees  though...,?
4480,' This meeting is nothing but a failed attempt to paint a false picture.  .  Trump is nothing but a belligerent  insecure and childish buffoon.  (…and a petty treasonous and traitorous con man.) . He's surrounded himself with racist white nationalist neo-Nazis  …and with this meeting he's only trying to paint a picture he doesn't fit within. . Resist Trump. Resist his agenda. .,?

4483,We had similar conflicts but pressure was put on our Borough who is the governmental shelter/protection rogram here. They have the enforcement of all animal related issues  including protection of animals (removing animals fro abusive people) investigation of complaints on noise (dogs barking mainly) and smell from animals  enforcement of our leash laws on beaches and public areas except for the Tongass National Forest (federal laws apply) . On state land or at one of our state parks  the State of Alaska does the enforcement. Any sea protected sea mammal found injured come under NOAA. The injured or dead raptors such as Eagles and Ravens re protected by federal law and come under US Fish and Wildlife. Because the shelter here was a kill shelter  the volunteer groups here worked together to insure that pets were taken care of in foster homes until they were re-homed. The same groups are committed for the spay/neuter of all mammals. Education/Prevention presentations in schools are done.,?

4486,Umm Hillary took 25 million from Saudi Arabia  about as ANTI Women and ANTI LGBTQ as you can get.  In addition  she eulogized Robert Byrd  high ranking KKK member.  As she has done for black communities is promote abortion.    You are such a hypocrite and fool!,?
4487,It's just a stupid motion. It's not a law. Why the bickering?,?

4489,Ever hear of Bugs Bunny? Check our the old BB toons and you'll find the origin of the use of maroon vice moron.,?
4490,Are we not taught that good citizens must trust their government to decide what they will afford and what will be provided to them?,?
4491,Trump is a rude child. Instead if acting like a leader he tweeted all weekend about NFL players  pandering to his zombie base. A real leader would have offered support  words of reassurance and asked for donations to help.  Instead he ignores 3.4 million AMERICANS suffering and dying and chastises men for peaceful prostest. Now that he has been called out  he sends out a bunch of disparaging tweets directed at Puerto Rico's leadership.   How can you defend that? That is not leadership  that is childish ego garbage. This latest display of a complete lack of leadership is sickening. I have no idea how anyone can support this buffoon.,?
4492,Don't you mean. "Did Sophie pack me enough socks?",?
4493,That was Kauai. She got caught and was charged in Federal court. Stupid beach.,?
4494,because at some point  the government will make a decision to cut something.  Cuts hurt someone.  Your comment is basically take it from someone else  not me.  Or  I don't use police  cut police.  Or I don't use a hospital  cut hospitals.  Or I don't like social support systems  cut those "losers.",?
4495,How can anyone trust anyone Dear Leader Donald puts up to run a ice cream Stand let alone the FBI. Just by the fact he was chosen by the man who has obstructed justice by firing the previous to take the pressure off the Russia investigation. And because he isn't a total piece of shit the dems are just supposed to take it. That's why I am no longer a Democrat.,?
4496,With that quote about how government should be run as a business  Kushner just proved himslef to be in the same category of idiot as his father.,?
4497,Poor naïve....... 'Trumps support base'. Sad.,?
4498,Betsy DeVos is so out of touch with regular people that it is scary.  Seems like we are going backwards with this administration whose sole goal is to undo everything President Obama did regardless of how it harms others.  Idiocy!,?
4499,Aren't you tired of all the winning yet?  Apparently the people of Virginia  New Jersey and Philadelphia are.,?
4500,So we arent all still paying for George W s mistakes?  Please.  The most inept moron ever.  I think most of us are completly ready to turn our back on the whole corrupt system repubs & dems alike.  Neither represent the people  just the monied elite.  Wake Up!  We have all been duped into thinking this election matters for anything.,?
4501,In a clash between China and the U.S.  Canada loses.  Trump wants to put new taxes on imports from China.  That means China will sell less in the U.S.  but they have a huge inventory of merchanidise to unload somewhere. If Canada is slow in following the U.S. in putting curbs on Chinese imports  Canada will be the "somewhere" where China dumps its exports.  What little is left of Canada's manufacturing is unlikely to survive.,?
4502,YOU are not all of BC  there are many of us in BC who are FOR this pipeline..........you are the one who is pretty ignorant and arrogant.,?
4503,I hope the next headline is "Idiot killed in hail of gunfire".,?
4504,Who is stupid enough to "expect this man to understand a life that worries about paying utility bills or affording an education."  I certainly don't have any such expectations of him!  That would be like expecting the same thing of Romney or any Kennedy or FDR or  Kerry or Pelosi or many of the multi-millionaires who currently constitute over one-half of the Senate and one-half of the House of Representatives!  That would not only be stupid  it would be ludicrous in the extreme!,?
4505,Praying for the family,?
4506,I feel like to through up seeing this scumbag. Who the fuck ask his opinion?,?
4507,Donald Trump is not well?  Most assuredly he is NOT well.  Trump is a narcissistic sociopath.  So  no  Trump is not well.  He has a mental illness.,?
4508,Esp from Mexicunts and Niggs,?
4509,What in the heck is wrong with you people down there in Juneau? We have spoken loud and clear and you don't seem to be able to hear us. We want you to stop funding the Susitna Dam and the Knik Arm Bridge and the road to nowhere in Juneau and revisit your tax giveaway to the oil companies. Do all this and we might want to listen to your  "shell game" schemes. I mean  did you think we were so stupid as to fall for that? Really?,?
4510,I didn't vote for Clinton so I'm not a fan but the difference between Bill Clinton and Trump was that's Clinton's victim was willing partner in the sex act thus he was not participating in a sex crime but adultery  but Trump confessed to groping her private area without her consent and that's a sex crime and that makes him a confessed sex offender and if you voted for you  approved of that action because every moron that voted for Trump knew about what he did but turned the other way so wittingly condoning sex crimes,?
4511,Good grief!!!  She actually gets paid to perpetuate pathetic lies?!!!,?
4512,Seeing that Nenshi degenerate makes me sick.  He's one of the worst people in Canadian politics and that is saying something.,?
4513,Hillary was stupid enough to use her unsecured personal communication device while in Russia  so they had access to her server and her emails years ago.  Hillary's chickens are on their way home.,?
4514,For most of us  it’ll be sufficient that Ms Notley’s ideas are worth voting against.  You do as you wish.,?
4515,Yo Muleman....Just because your ignorant and like boorish and uncivilized behavior by our present President  Doesn't make you an expert....Actually your the problem not Broomfieldonian.....Obviously This type of behavior is more like a spoiled child having a tantrum  than A civilized Man of 70 who is representing America as "our" quote Leader....,?
4516,Jeff Sessions is a pathetic beaten dog who begs for table scraps and gets only the belt in reward. Trump will withhold his praise until the Justice Department capitulates and declares Trump and his family above the law.,?
4517,What he did the opposite?!!  OMG. Just like they did with the rail.  IMPEACH THEM ALL!  IMPEACH THEM ALL!  BETTER YET  PUT THEM IN JAIL!,?
4518,NO  support  Alberta workers though  sands workers though ...best we get alook at Justins holdings ...did he maybe get some stock options ?,?
4519,Angola is probably a prime example of a country that could thrive if only the ruling scum didn't loot all the cash.,?
4520,Well....DC and MD were just as Democratic from 2001-09 as they are now.  Why didn't they find a reason to sue George W. Bush?  It never ceases to amaze me how straight up stupid Trump fanboys are.,?
4521,She is very narrow minded on homeless  does not want to see the full picture.  The concern I have is this  we have those who choose to be homeless  we have those who wish not to be homeless.  So we should help those who want help  and we should find a way to help those who don't.  This problem has gotten so big  been around so long  that a solution just does not seem to be there.,?
4522,SEP not educateed at all given his brain washed left wing bs spewing when he as usual can not argue with facts yet again   tell us loser lefty  how about an argument on my position ? no of course not  its insult as usual from empty spewing ignorant fools of the scam of the century,?
4523,Yankees suck....Yankees suck....,?
4524,Scalia was famous for making up his own crap  and a certain voting population ate it up.,?
4525,i think that over time  trump has learned how to make chaos work for him.  he uses it like a smoke screen or like slight of hand.  he only has one focus and it's not ruling this country. he is all about increasing Trump coffers.,?
4526,Why are we in such a headlong rush to have "free" (and it is anything but free) with one of the most brutal dictatorships on the planet???,?
4527,It's not government's responsibility,?
4528,you clearly are a wall full short of bricks period bud.. take your stupidity and get help,?
4529,You are absolutely 100% on the money! There is no profit for the zio mafia with peace. The Israeli's didn't go to all of the trouble to pull off 911 and kill all of those innocent Americans just to collect a couple of billion dollars in insurance money for the buildings they powdered...they did it to manipulate public sentiment into sending our military to the middle east to act as Israel's leg breakers as they paraded us into one contrived reason  to invade and conquer a country's currency after another. I don't think it's possible to rid ourselves of these dangerous parasites,?
4530,Well  while what you have written about the;current government is 'kind of' correct (I think they lied about not being committed to this deal)  so was the last lot.     Including nonsense about this PM "hating Canadians" does nothing to advance your argument and  is just plain inane.,?
4531,Yes he is.  Ted is an abomination.,?
4532,DUDE it's not a party until you wipe out on your sled right smack into human feces and used hypodermic needles.,?
4533,One Russian front group  named “Being Patriotic ” promoted at least four pro-Trump anti-Clinton rallies  as well as flash mob events in the key swing state of Florida in August 2016.,?
4534,Just as I thought . Our political leaders are just going through a formality just to continue the rail. Blowing smoke is what this is. The mayor will raise property tax I can guarantee that    who the hell wants to visit Hawaii with high cost of rates  and all the other means to get money for this mess. Hawaii is becoming more and more expensive to live .,?
4535,The losers are the fans rooting for these guys who on average make more in a year than they do in a 30 year working career......typical Jays fan....loser with no life,?
4536,Don’t worry. ‘Diversity is our strength’ TM.,?
4537,A little like closing the barn door after the horse has bolted  isn't it Justin? What a complete and utter jackass.,?
4538,Hydro one isn't replacing essential equipment !!! Bonny Rate  the Ontario auditor.general stated equipment has not been improved and power outages are more frequent than ever.  The auditors report is damning  it states 1/4 of all the assets owned by hydro one are in desperate need of repair.. The Wynne government continues to pretended they have made historic investment even after multiple  damming Ontario auditor general report.stating other wise.  When compared to other Canadian provinces Ontario still has 60 percent more outages  The truth is the equipment is worse than ever and an additional 5 billion is needed for repair and replacement .  The lunacy is Niagara Falls is running at 50 percent today because its windy  water is purposely being spilled !!!!!  A clean energy source that has been with us since 1923 - its enough to pull your hair out.  Yes Liberal alternative facts!!!!!!,?
4539,Harper/Trump bootlicker SaySomething is grossly ignorant and irrelevant all of the time. (If France elects Marine Le Pen it will be barbaric. You support her. ),?
4540,No it didn't work. This has been proven over and over except in the minds of right wingers. The most recent FAILURE is the Brownback FAILURE in Kansas. Read about it.,?
4541,Happy Holidays!,?
4542,I have a VERY simple solution..... If she and her partner are those SKINNY hot lesbians you see in porn...... hire her back. If she and her partner are the big bull dykes you see hanging around truck stops...... she stays fired.  Problem solved,?
4543,A writer's credibility goes out the window when they have to resort to name calling.,?
4544,You CNN people crack me up. Get over your hate or get therapy or something.  You are some of the worst sore losers ever.  It's going to a long eight years for you and plenty of people are already tired of your whining and sniveling.,?
4545,It was cute. I always wondered what it would be when the News grew up into a full size newspaper.,?
4546,Child rape is cool  if the right people do it.,?
4547,So a meaningless poll taken 2 years away from in election in the summer when nobody is paying attention and fits your narrative should be taken as gospel but I am sure should the result change on another meaningless poll taken in 6 months with the CPC much closer and a Conservative uses it to show that Trudeau`s support is dropping  you will be the first to claim the poll is flawed just like the Angus Reid poll showing 71% of Canadians against the Khadr payout because it does not fit your narrative. Too funny!,?
4548,What rubbish---what have indigenous bands done for the Canadian economy? They are parasitic on a successful economy that supports them,?
4549,NOTE to all the poor  put-upon Trump snowballs who get picked on and victimized so much: I detest the black-clad anarchists  antifa nitwits and vandals in Guy Fawkes masks even more than the Trump booboisoie. They're parasites sabotaging and undermining the legitimate political protest they use for cover because they are essentially cowards. To claim that real Democrats support and approve of these yobs is just one more low slander. I felt the same way about the SDS in the 60s. A plague on both your houses!,?
4550,There is less and less of you everyday. There will come a day when your idiot in chief will fall and I pray that for the sake of our country it will be soon.,?
4551,You wish.,?
4552,I applaud the French government for assuring that people can vote without fear of being attacked by some deranged idiot  who thinks he can change the world with a bomb or a gun.  The only party that gains from terrorism is the Front National. Hopefully fear will never triumph over reason.  We'll see tomorrow.,?
4553,Any religion should stay out of school premises. A stupid mistake trying to accommodate any religion ceremonies at school.,?
4554,Has this pathetic parasite ever spent a day governing?,?
4555,If you people haven't got the message you should now ! Learn a lesson that China is a dictatorship that puts it's  people in jail ! Who has a right to say who can talk to who ? Only an egotistical ass  Those who think they are God and that you have to do as they say ! In simple terms  when they shit  you don't stop until they tell you to  or jump and don't come down until your told to  You should never buy a damn thing from China ! and you now you got your reasons why ! Now you have good reason to tell the other ass seeking to have talks with China to stop dealing with them !,?
4556,All these commenters crying about the kneelers are the same people who mocked those who were upset about the election result. Lol. Love it. Suck it up buttercups.,?
4557,Dumb and irrelevant comments were bad enough  now racism? Grow up.,?
4558,You don't understand anything about the dividend check  that's obvious. It's a tool to stop politicians from raiding the fund. Once dividends are gone  nobody will care about the fund and it will be depleted.,?
4559,"Semi-automatic weapons and magazines have been around for years (decades?) prior to 1973."  Yep.  Even the evil  scary AR-15 has been available for nearly 53 years. Page 19 of the November 1964 issue of Guns magazine had a full-page advertisement from Colt for the "AR-15 Sporter". A semi-automatic rifle chambered in .223 Remington  with a 20-round magazine.  Available from any Colt dealer for $189.50 (about $1500 today  according to https://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl). Back then  of course  it could be delivered to your door with no background check.  http://gunsmagazine.com/1964issues/G1164.pdf,?
4560,It's too bad we can't just execute them.,?
4561,This attempted rape happened right where the badly needed Bragraw street extension to all the hospitals and universities would have been. You know the little section of road that was already studied  engineered  funded  and shovel ready. Our new mayor said no. It's just that simple.,?
4562,You are right.... couldn't get past the part where he talks about grabbing pussy  where he makes fun of the disabled where he talks about building a wall  and kicking out Muslims.  How can you love this country if you do all that?,?
4563,Yea  using your firearm to try room prevent a property crime is very stupid. Very sad.,?
4564,Equally repugnant to white Supremacists  Nazis  etc. are BLM and antifa commies. This violent confrontation was a false flag op set up by leftist factions in VA. I am white  and I don't like people going around calling for my extermination any more than Blacks like it. The counter protesters are every every bit as evil as the protesters on the other side. It's the same paid rioters (leftists) that have been around for a long time now. These are not protesters with a beef. These are paid anarchists financed generally by George Soros & associates to disrupt society. Soros is a monster and why he is not removed from the stage  I cannot fathom. Emily Jashinsky  the writer of this article sounds like a useful idiot  a self hating white woman who's been poisoned by PC. There is no balance to the content at all. The writer loses credibility when the bias is obvious.,?
4565,He should still be in prison - he is a traitor and got real Americans killed......,?
4566,That's wishful thinking.  Chinese Vice Commerce Minister Qian Keming is living in a silo if he thinks there is no link.  Watch Trump slap a 40% duty on Chinese goods and we'll see how fast China discovers this linkage.,?
4567,And the rental suite further clogs the street with added cars and adds pressure to the infrastructure.  Not so great.,?
4568,Then let's provide them an unlimited market but make sure the taxpayer shares in the ludicrous returns his investment in the commons made possible. Use the cash and under 3% government bonds to build lotsa of low cost rental units with all costs including finance covered by rents or rent to own.  Note that developers require 15%+  returns on their cash.   Need some extra finance. BC Green proposal - capital gains tax on any speculator or homeowner sales over $1 million and hefty vacant unit taxes.  Funny  GM pundit Sauders in another article today  thinks disbanding the OMB will greatly improve housing disagreeing with Gee here - which is it?  My plan would use up vacant government land first then as prices drop  replace single family neighourhoods block by block with medium rise construction.,?
4569,I don't have kids but I know that my parents left me in running cars in Fairbanks when I was a kid  and they certainly didn't lock the doors.  And  it was none of the mayor's business.  It's not reckless endangerment to get divorced  drink beer at softball games and work 60 hour weeks  but somehow running into Starbucks is what's going to damage a kid?  Idiots...,?
4570,Everybody you trust to tell you the truth is a liar and a fraud.,?
4571,No compassion  stupid  irrational  and all the other things that are said about "poor Otto."  Yes  he made his choice to go to NK and he paid a price for it.  The NK are not going to be nice and baby him because he is an American  expect the opposite treatment.  His parents allowed him to go so they should accept the responsibility for what happened.  He probably was tortured and became brain-dead because he couldn't handle it.  The  NK could care less  and I'm surprised they didn't kill him.  Now he is back in the US and he can't tell his story  too bad it would have been a very interesting one at that.  Goes to show  that you are a victim of what you choose to do with your life  right or wrong.,?
4572,Docs have been doing this for years. You wouldn't even want to know what they say and do during colonoscopies. These nurses were merely too stupid to keep their mouths shut- this happens all the time.,?
4573,He did not lie about it  it is a fabrication from your side.,?
4574,Finally some common sense in this argument! Way to go Canadian Medical Association! It is about time there was more discussion of the problems that legalization for recreational purposes will cause. My son mow regrets strongly getting involved with marijuana. It has wreaked havoc on him  his relationships. We lived through it and it is not pretty!,?
4575,She would look great with a dirty Sanchez. Or she'd just look like a whore. Oh wait  she is a whore  that you can find naked online right now. P.S. your mother can also be found with a gapped asshole online ;),?
4576,This may indicate a change in Russia-US relations  as EXXON was doing quite a good business over there  before Obama came up with his idiotic sanctions     ;)),?
4577,If he's so stupid  as to not listen to his own Intelligence people on a regular basis  why would he listen to anything China says? The man is a walking time bomb to the world.  To his Intelligence people: "Don't call me  I'll call you. I'll let you know when I need you". Playing hard ball with China won't work. He has no idea of the consequences of his 'strong man' approach. There will indeed be serious and long lasting consequences if he pursues taking sides with Taiwan. This isn't just another business competitor he can bully around.,?
4578,Did he shut down her speech? I see no mention of Ms. Dodd having been removed in chains. She said something racist and stupid at a public forum  someone pointed out that she said something racist and stupid. There are consequences for behaviors.,?
4579,Unbelievable! Trying to take credit for NY decision. They never promised her to buy from Ontario only. I am not a supporter of any party  but in my 24 years in Ontario  I learned to hate government as portrayed by the Liberals. The leave you no choice with all the dirt they pile. In my opinion  none of the 3 big parties of today meets the aspirations of Canadians  and putting a young and pretty face on top of the Liberal party does not change the fact that its ideology is antiquated.,?
4580,UN Human Rights Experts?   I take it these "experts" will include Saudi Arabia  Iran  China  Syria  Turkey  etc. They know all about human rights and the lack of them.,?
4581,They had the intelligence to cover their faces  unlike these guys who did not  and then called others idiots.,?
4582,The GAO and other reputable organizations say that the fraud was 60 billion dollars while you want us to blindly believe you on this nonsense... PLEASE. The funny thing is your own article proves your lie.   Do grow up Windbourne.,?
4583,WOW you are a real mess. me<you  Obama gave billions and uranium to Death to America Iraq.  He gave tanks and jets to the Muslim Brotherhood.  Hillary spent weeks trying to get dirt on Trump.  The so called  by you  attempts to get dirt on the Clintons  was a 20 minute meeting by Trump Jr. not the Donald.  Further the Russian agent involve was barred by the US.  Then the Clintons got her a backdoor pass.  THEN she made a meeting with Trump Jr. for an entirely different reason using dirt as an invitation.  So  NO collusion for your illusion confusion.,?
4584,The Glob is the Zionists/Ashkenazis/Khazarians whore.,?
4585,Good on her for getting up and knocking the chicken-sh*t down.  You be a hero  Lady.,?
4586,burned out for 6 yrs? too bad.  jerk cop should have quit 5 yrs ago....,?
4587,lol!!  You may have hit on something....what if Trump declares that he is now a democrat?  These snowflakes would all go insane!   Oh wait  they already are!!,?
4588,You're right re the Japs.,?
4589,dummy  the article is about trump  cannot understand what you read?  you must be as smart or as dumb as trump  it shows.,?
4590,Pearlmutter isn't afraid of his populations he represents  Corey is a coward.  Real easy to see the difference when you aren't boot licking the rich as a Republican ...,?
4591,Baloney.   The rail is an out of control boondoggle mismanaged by a bunch of incompetent fools.  Time to do a forensic audit and put people in jail if willful mismanagement is found.,?
4592,Wow! Your progressive psychosis has become extreme! Please seek immediate medical help.,?
4593,As I continue to say...good bye Notely  you are a failure.,?
4594,Your post became garbage to me as soon as you said "you right wing extremists". Just because I'm vocal about certain issues hardly makes me a "right wing extremist"  but if you want to believe that  go for it.,?
4595,Sort of like Sodom and Gomorrah  eh? By not prostrating themselves on the alter of climate change they set themselves up for retribution. Nice homily but I've heard similar sermons before.,?
4596,Richard John Esq. " Richard Johnson Esq. 3 hours ago "Poor Choon nothing to do on a Friday night but post drivel. Even the North Shore locals avoid her like the plague."   You "LIKE" your own comment again.    You can't debate on the facts about pilau Mayor Caldwell  you have to resort to desperate innuendos like this. Pathetic!,?
4597,Not really necessary to disclose to the media but certainly to every parent of every child,?
4598,Multitribalism is a curse.,?
4599,Single payer works in 37 countries with better care than the USA.  Your idiotic hyperbole is old.,?
4600,A few years ago  I met a guy in New Zealand who said he had traveled to just about every corner of the world. In all of his travels  he said the stupidest people he met were in Houston. I guess he never visited Minnesota.,?
4601,maybe these people should travel out of country to see what the world is really like! Apply for TSA Pre✓ or Global Entry! Quit the bitching and do something to help yourselfs.,?
4602,Ah  I look forward to being woken up tomorrow morning by the endless cacophony of sirens as the police respond to the many dozens if not hundreds of accidents and "incidents" on the snowy Glenn Highway due to all the idiots who think that their tailgating  texting-while-driving  and 70+ mph driving habits  as dangerous as they are in DRY conditions  are just as suitable and appropriate in icy and snowy conditions.  I'll laugh  and I'll laugh.  But they  on the other hand  will never learn.,?
4603,The 'players' spent too much time working out how they were going to disrespect our anthem and flag  as they do 'endzone celebrations'  For me  not another moment of nfl  they can have it  without a dime from me or mine.  Good riddance  arrogant bums.,?
4604,Question......Who's he?,?
4605,Mr. Phillip  our government spends billions of dollars maintaining aboriginal communities. Where do you suppose that money comes from....the government's private money trees? A good chunk of it is royalties from resource sales. The same resources that those pipelines carry. There is no free lunch  Mr. Phillip.,?
4606,You could garnish their income.....knew a lawyer who was about to get punched by a local guy  happened in the bar and I was their. Guy didn't like the way my friend was speaking.....politics......funniest thing I ever saw  guy backed off. Local guy thought he was talking to a stupid haole.,?
4607,Pyjamas boy/ feminist Justin is a joke ……… who the hell voted for him??????,?
4608,This is quite possibly the stupidest statement I've ever read. I know that may seem mean but I'm serious.,?
4609,"high attorney fees "   Damn lawyers ruin everything.,?
4610,Shameless self-righteous ignorance from Wynne's Unions friends - this represents the future direction of Canada and it's a pathetic embarrassment of perpetually offended social justice clown shoes.,?
4611,As an ole sour dough.... Dividend  your comment sucks....  as do you.,?
4612,Trump said "global warming is a Chinese hoax" What a fool. You cannot deny the climate is warming. You can argue the cause of the warming,?
4613,Dianne f is pathetic.,?
4614,So true  you nailed it.,?
4615,I wouldn't completely bet on that. Doesn't Waianae store some 40 nuclear weapons and  Tomahawk SLCM's in the the Naval magazine located in Lualualei Valley? If anything I bet any enemy would strike multiple spots. Secondly  even if they were to leave Waianae untouched I somehow doubt anyone would survive. Best option is to build a personal submarine and sit things out a few miles off the coast.,?
4616,The press seems to love war.  They get lots of stories  heroes  villains  tragedy  it makes their jobs easy.,?
4617,You're pathetic. You really believe that a kid that excelled in school  called his parents when he was going to be a little late for his 9pm curfew & wasn't even known by the other "gang" members was leading this double life as a gun/drug dealer? Gtfo!,?
4618,Maybe if dumbass Otto wasn't over in North Korea tearing down NK propaganda HE would've avoided this situation altogether.,?
4619,Most likely  clearing snow for placement of bridge beams is incidental to the contract  meaning not a pay item.  Waiting for snow melt likely doesn't tie in with the project timeframe  and breakup usually triggers Load Restrictions  which seriously hamper most road construction projects.  This is because material hauled to and from a project  travels over existing roads  which aren't being re-done.  As for building roads during a recession  most of it is done with federal infrastructure funding (90% on the New Swd  it said).  That's too much of a deal to pass up.  Any responsible legislature will find the matching funds  in order to cover the expense.  Likewise  during a recession  a road job puts people to work  and infuses funds into the Blessed Private Sector (hallelujah). Further  during lean times  construction bidding becomes much more competitive  serving to hold down that cursed govt spending.,?
4620,lol  no comparison.  It is amazing how you phony conservatives just have a double stasndard.  Its ok if you are republican. Well its not.  The Donald is little more than a big fat liar who makes GW look good.  Pathetic.  Oh and while Bill was impeached by the House  it was dismissed by the Senate.  We shall see if the Donald is as lucky.    But I will continue to enjoy the Donald.  He is funny as hell.   I miss the Mooch.  lol,?
4621,Sarah Sanders shouldn't be mocked for her weight. But for being completely white trash  now that's fair game!!,?
4622,agree...Cladwell is clueless about what is happening in his deteriorating city.  UHD needs to hire many more legitimate police officers from the mainland.  We need to increase the size of HPD and its quality.  WE need a competent commission and police chief.  Kealoha was always a joke from the start.  He lacked the intelligence and integrity for the job.  Honolulu is VERY dangerous and crime rates are way way up.  Don't be fooled by the monopoly party out here.

4630,Something not mentioned is that ice cores sampled in past decades may become increasingly irreplaceable as alpine glaciers melt away throughout the world.

4631,YouTube should have reported immediately. Counseling? Try charges and removal of children untill the Martin's "understand what they did wrong". Stupid. This is evil. It may or may not be staged  but to these kids it is real. A horrible nightmare. You see kids believe what their moms and dads tell them. These kids are never going to forget these words of screaming accusations knowing he was innocent   filthy words and mocking. You do not ever speak to a child with that ugliness. They resent those kids...and their words and actions are showing that to their children who did not ask to be born and the world. Twisting the minds as a joke before idiots.

She was dressed as Damon Tweedy. That makes this blackface. There is no need for you to deduce anything  Sherlock. First of all  your skills of deduction are horrible. And second  there is no need to  because the information is supplied for you by those who actually have knowledge  and aren't simply basing their opinion upon facts they made up on the spot. Is that what you mean by "smart?" Because it isn't.,?

4657,It is true that 'privately run schools paid by the government can provide public education'.  In Oregon that tends to be charter schools aligned with a local district  receiving tax money and subject to most of the rules applied to public schools.  They kept 'separation of church and state' but may hire non-certified teachers  which cuts their costs.  You are mistaken in thinking DeVos wants public education.  She advocates for schools receiving government money but with no government oversight for subject matter.  What better way to control the thinking of future citizens?,?

4663,Unfortunately  the system teaches public assistance recipients to be irresponsible with their PFD money.  It's called the "spend down" and people on assistance have 30 days to spend their PFD money and then report to their public assistance case worker how they spent the money.  If they don't spend all the money within thirty days it will be counted as income for them the next month. Seriously.  Instead of teaching them to save  spend wisely  etc. they are taught to blow their money.  And blow the money they do.  While some use the money to get caught up on bill all too often  too many  literally waste the money.  So yes  while it may not be "PC" to use their PFD money to offset the expense of the benefits they receive  the system is not doing them any favors by teaching/requiring them to continue a fiscally irresponsible lifestyle.,?

4688,It is far better to walk away from a deal that is not favourable for our nation.    The alternative is to prematurely celebrate it (before it is even ratified)  or prematurely list the deal as an "accomplishment" (before it is even ratified) thus putting our country in a position of looking desperate to finalize it.       Worse - signing a bad deal just so that the party in power can propagandize about "Getting things done".  Ratifying a deal is where the hard work is done  and if the other parties to the deal can't agree on terms that are acceptable for Canada  then walking away is absolutely the right tactic.     Let the EU sort out the holdouts and herd their own cats.,?

4691,Congratulations to the Planning Commission for crafting a sensible and flexible solution to this new problem.  I hope the proposed ordinance is enacted.  Something to remember is that rural properties have a very different fire risk than urban ones  --  except where they are on some kind of collective water system  most rural buildings are protected only by their own wells  and will basically burn down if they catch fire.  There really is a safety concern with a giant rural building housing a dozen people that's only built to residential standards.  For comparison  Port Angeles requires new residential construction outside the 4-minute response zone to have sprinkler systems.  I thought about the Dzogchen Ltd "B&B" when I watched a special about the White House last week.  Did you know there are 35 bathrooms in the whole of the White House  including the East and West Wings?  The Dzogchen building will have 25.  Just sayin'.,?

If they did not make this call  some might recognize the bishops don't actually care  and that could have a negative impact on their status  political power  and income.  The facade must be protected.  It's really the last thing the hierarchy has to cling to.,?

Cosmetic surgery and gastric bypass procedures.    The fact that they are resorting to adverts suggests their volumes are down.  I imagine the US$ exchange rate has something to do with that.,?

4706,Some incorrect information in this article.  SALMON UPDATE FROM BASIN TACKLE IN CHARLESTON; There seems to have been a lot of confusion regarding the recent salmon season updates and season closures.

(south of Port Orford) to the California border (not the whole Southern Oregon coast). the chinook salmon season in our zone from Cape Falcon to Humbug Mt. opened March 15th and will continue through October 31st without interruption. We are wide open Folks! We have even had winners in our "first salmon of the season contest"!  You can watch for updates on FB at Basin Tackle Charleston.

4711,Today was Trump's most disgraceful display of cowardice and incompetence yet. His failure to condemn the white supremacists and neo-Nazis and his blaming "many sides" is intended to further empower these racist  anti-semitic hate groups. He built his campaign on hate  he staffed his White House with white supremacists and Nazis  so we should not be surprised these groups feel sanctioned to spew their racist hate freely.,?
4712,This is what I DO know.  I don't have to listen to you if I don't want to.  It's called freedom.  It's in those docs you cited.  But of course....you already know that.  Look man.

If you wanna attack the commentors  then maybe you should remember that whoever insinuates  or denigrates the other side in an argument (discussion rather) then that side has already lost.  But of course....you already know that  too.,?
4713,Disgusting. Alaska has become such a third world dung hole. You can't own anything nice  or it will be stolen  trashed or killed. Highland cows are wonderful and beautiful animals. They are more worthy of living than the many demented lowlives in Alaska that have nothing better to do than drive around and shoot anything with a pulse.,?
4714,The stupid part about all this is that a few weeks ago  trump stated that he started looking over the ACA and that some of it had a few good points. Granted  the bill was far from perfect  but since hardly anyone read it before it was voted on  there's NO reason for them to scrap the entire thing  but they can sure as hell fix the shortcomings.  Sumbitchin insurance industry anyway.,?
4715,From the 1950s to today  and in every nation in the world:   If you allow them to hang out with boys  this is what gay priests will do.  The only solution is to bar all priests from boys  or to bar gays from the priesthood.  And yet  we have progressives who think the church needs even more gay priests  and that the sexual orientation of gau priests be kept a secret from the public.  And yes  I reject the silly idea that men who rape boys are not gay.,?

4727,(Part 1 of 3) Heidi - I would like to say that I share your optimism  but I can’t The reasons for my skepticism come from a lack of informal organization in Bellevue. I agree that tools like nextdoor.com allow for the potential for better communication  as does this newspaper’s website (the Bellevue Reporter). The City offers similar tools to communicate with staff and eventually elected officials  as well as old-fashioned ad hoc workshops and regular Commission meetings. In one sense  we have the potential to communicate now better than in the past.  What the neighborhoods lack is a semblance of organization. Even in the new Bellevue downtown  I’ve overheard younger folks with some interest in this lamenting the fact they hadn’t communicated their concerns effectively in workshops or directly to elected officials; the fault is not in the stars  but our cultural environment. It’s an ancient Bellevue refrain. It’s a pattern.,?

4733,"People don't burn other people alive" You need to acquaint yourself with autos da fe in Middle Ages Europe. Christians did precisely that to women accused of witchcraft  Jews who refused to convert  Christians who were accused of heresy (that is  they held beliefs the authorities didn't approve of)  and others. After some Jews rejected Martin Luther's protestant Christianity as not being their cup of tea  Martin Luther suggested locking Jews in synagogues and setting the synagogues on fire. If that's too ancient for you  only 30 years ago  Christians were raping and slaughtering Muslims in the former country of Yugoslavia. Last year  Jews living in the West Bank burned down Arabs' houses and mosques  and in at least one house  the occupants were in it. Terrorists are brutal. A lot of terrorists are Muslim. That does NOT make all Muslims dogs. If a man from Arvada gets angry at his ex-wife and burns down her home with her in it  are all Arvadans to be considered dogs?,?

4748,Thanks not how property taxes work. Property taxes pay for municipal services. Toronto I more dense and therefore has a greater municipal service/infrastructure utilisation rate  ergo property taxes can be equivalently lower.  Highways are a provincial mandate. Why should toronto be the only municipality to pay for the highways within its borders using property taxes? Why does mississauga not pay for 401 and qew within its borders? Why should Torontonians subsidise highways in other munixipalities throigh provincial taxes yet not receive the same?   And FYI Toronto is a net contributor to Ontario and Canada via income  sales and corporate taxes  no one subsidises Toronto's needs. Even transit is 80% out of farebox (high compared to other systems).  Municipalities should get more gas tax AND be able to toll. Tolling is also about reducing congestion and making those that do drive time more efficient.   If other municipalities need transit  they should build it like Toronto has.,?
4749,What a brilliant strategy by Mueller to indict Manafort and Gates this morning.  Let Trump do his tweeter and other Trumpeteers do their thing  so they are on record.  90 minutes later unseal the Papadopoulus guilty plea.  Open mouth (tweeter) insert foot. Then ask what happened.  They were Muellered!  Awesome.,?
4750,Hello! It's#2017! Harrumph!,?
4751,Quick  check the Twitter feed  see if the Twitterer in Chief has something relevant to tweet about this. Or is he scared "twitless" again. He can't afford to make "Pooty" mad.,?
4752,I am sorry my friends.  War is coming over there unless China takes this idiot out.  Do not wait too late like in WWII.  Nothing I can do to stop it.,?
4753,The Donald's boasts claiming himself capable of being America's only choice for our Commander in Chief and seemingly convincing many of my fellow citizens of that claim  reminds me of the phrase coined  by a critic of another  business man who took great satisfaction in duping his clients   "There's a sucker born every minute.",?
4754,Really  that's your response.  Everyone in these departments are "lying commies."  So that would make you an idiotic  unpatriotic  ignorant  blue tarp flapping redneck.  Oops  that's redundant  my bad.  See how far name calling goes: we're now back in the first grade.  How about elevating your discourse  if you are able to  and join the big boys' table.,?
4755,Who gives a shit it's truth!,?
4756,You sound like a terrorist.,?
4757,Irrelevant drivel. Prejudice exists in all races. In North America   blacks are much more prejudiced against than they are prejudiced. To suggest otherwise is stupidly inflammatory.,?
4758,I'm not even a Trump supporter but to blame this on him idiotic beyond description.,?
4759,they are already in the US. Hawaii has some of them,?
4760,What is this deductive reasoning garbage? Is it to show me how smart you think you are? Psychology  which is probably your thing  is beyond crap. But your advice was carefully crafted to ensure that guys like me weren't able to nail you to the wall with it. For that you are to be commended.,?

She died of cancer. Your such a coward and a jerk. Only a POS would abuse a dead woman to attack another.,?

4774,I was going northbound on Minnesota about noon after doing some last-minute shopping at FM in Dimond.  About half-way between Strawberry and Raspberry  over on the southbound lanes side  there was a car that had gone through the fence.  I shudder to think what had happened - the hole in the fence was SOUTH of where the car came to rest.,?
4775,Maybe Bruce could go back to jail where he belongs and the only disturbance would be for a midnight snack!  What a moron!,?
4776,stupid is as stupid does.  It should be attempted murder if he fired into a crowd of people.  Plum lucky no one was hurt.  They're both 18......let those twerps spend time in jail w/some narly ilks.  Will it make a difference and change their life around?  Ah  probably not.,?

4783,One can’t help but laugh at these morons… or moron  for that matter    ;),?
4784,A friend of mine voted for Trump because as he puts it  Hillary should be in jail and only Trump can save the middle class.   Today  that same friend when asked what he though about Trumps nominations for cabinet positions responded with  'well I haven't really been following things since the elections...'   Ugh!   Silly people did stupid things and now they aren't even paying attention to the consequences.   But the silver lining is we will have four great years of SNL.,?
4785,see liberal hack when anyone government or private person calls for bad policies that have proven to do the opposite of what you want  cost jobs and lower incomes on those you say will help makes you an oppressor who does not care for people or just a completely ignorant stupid person! ,?
4786,I have way more than a clue  cholo. You're lecturing someone with formal law school training in immigration law. Immigration officers aren't free to exercise whims and intuitions in deciding whether to admit a visitor; they're bound by regulations  policies  and precedents  and their decisions are subject to oversight  reconsideration  and appeal. "Suspicion " whether plain or simple  is just that: unsubstantiated suspicion. Suspicion can warrant higher-level interrogation and investigation  and in some cases a reasonable period of detention -- but  ultimately  there must be a showing of good cause for denial of entry if  as in the case of this Australian visitor  she had previously sought and been granted permission  to visit our country. Based on the facts related in the news story  there was no such good cause.,?
4787,Birth control for my employees that's against my religious beliefs! making money off smuggled artifacts not against my beliefs! got it  okay hypocrites... In $$$ We Trust! Karma is a B****!,?
4788,Did you ever Listen to LBJ's comments. That was one foul nasty old man. Check out what "Mr.Great Society" said regarding blacks when he backed the 1964 Civil Rights act.  Incidently  that passed only because of republican backing.,?
4789,Uhhh mcdummy is a democrat and a traitor and someone who paid for the fake dossier on trump. I don't know where you're getting majority wants this failed socialist obummer care but like your savior mcdummy you're a liar,?
4790,Fortunately Bernie will be canceling out your vote..If Clinton wins  she and Bernie will work together for the interests and needs of people and the planet. A vote is a precious thing to waste. Why not be part of moving Alaska and America forward?,?
4791,ks  China does not deny the facts about climate change and  the human causation factor. They are cooperating with other nations to solve the problem by signing  the Paris Accord. Trumpet is only concerned about a selfish monetary advantage.  China has a BILLION citizens  at risk if they do not deal with reality.,?
4792,Agragiiq ignore FB and all the other IGNORANT people. Good Job hold your head high!,?
4793,Roy Anthony is a liar.,?
4794,Attack? It sounded like  a peaceful substitution of Iraqi Federal forces for regional Kurdish forces. Granted  it might have gone south if the Kurds had resisted. Still  Mr. Levy's argument is quite similar to Russia's justification for Crimea. The world needs to become more accepting of multi-ethnic states  rather than allow itself to be carved up into small  weak mono-cultural ones. If a minority region wants to unilaterally  break away from its larger state  it should only be supported by the international community if it is currently being oppressed  not based on historical grievances. Like in Catalonia. (funny how so many aggrieved regions seeking independence are the wealthier part of their country.,?
4795,"Imagine for a moment that all you have to do to get out of a car lease is to total your car " --- Actually that is all you have to do. Too bad is against the law (fraud).  As for the letter  it shows the level of responsibility of today's consumer.,?
4796,Don't know about "split second"  but  I'm pretty sure he did after he pulled the trigger and realized what he had done.  And no doubt his boss did more than pee.  I hear they don't treat ex-cops well in prison...,?

4798,Don't be ridiculous; they were doing their jobs monitoring hostile foreign government mucking about in the 2016 election. No scandal there. But let's talk about your blindness to the President being Putin's puppet......,?
4799,By the same token  I get tired of lazy thinkers who worship at the altar of the almighty  bureaucratic soul-sucking slug of the federal government.,?

4802,These dudes are a waste of oxygen  why cant we be like texas and line them up for the chair 😨,?
4803,I don't approve of any religious activity at school.  However  I do agree with you that the children are being victimized by both sides; by having to witness the demonstrations against the teaching of their religious dogma in school and by their own parents who allow their children to be put in this position in order to win their battle.  What is more important to the parents? That their children be allowed to practice religion in school  or that they have a happy  carefree childhood?,?
4804,Deep ecology madness is a sad sick religion.,?
4805,How can you say Alaska makes no money off commercial fishing when that industry employs more people than any other?  You deny all that jobs money spins through the economy  transportation  groceries  fuel  etc?     And the HALF of the fish taxes that go into the state general fund DO benefit Palmer  Fairbanks  etc. because the legislature can use those funds anywhere they want. And seafood exports are Alaska's most valuable - more $.  Do your homework  your Truths are tweaked.,?
4806,There is no such thing as THE truth. All good scientists  theologians and philosophers attempt to tug and stretch for more truth.  Newton to Einstein  Aquinas to Kung.  The problem with truth in doctrine is like truth in Myth.  Myth and doctrine are the stories we live by until we understand more of truth.  Man is always alive in his/her growth and development.  That is why the Holy Spirit is with us until the end of time.  When some doctrinaire people begin to think that finite men can understand THE TRUTH  they really are stretching their own abilities to the point of believing that they can know the Great Mind of God.  This of course is idolatry.  Steven it is your lack of insight you should worry about not Mr. Winters.  Perhaps you could look for  an ophthalmologist of the soul  because your characterization of Mr. Winters is without soul or good knowledge or instinct.  Funny that is the same thing you projected into Mr. Winters.,?
4807,Free advertising? Does the SA provide that kind of advertising for ANYONE opening up a PR firm? Yeah  didn't think so. Gotta know when to draw the line. Ethics  SA  ethics!,?
4808,Calling everybody that disagrees with you a racist and anti-Muslim is pretty uncivil. Also intellectually bankrupt...,?
4809,Jesus did not say "ask people to give  you are doing them a favor by asking them to do so"  you did. THAT is what I am saying is a stupid statement.  Your attempts to defend your stupidity only reinforce my poor opinion of your intelligence.,?

4815,Tax grabs crippling us all. Wow  nothing new. Justin like his Dad tax  more tax. Remember the wasted taxes on Mirabel. Yes  clean up the environment  how  better technology. Not  more tax while free trading away Canada.But then Justin  the man born with a silver spoon and who has lived at taxpayers expense for so much of his life and thought it was ok to take money from a charity in the past. Sad so little imagination from so called leaders!!,?
4816,it is better to be handsome  rich and smart  than ugly  poor and stupid,?
4817,Calling Obama a subhuman mongrel is uncivil and should get Nugent barred from civil society. So is calling Obama a chimpanzee. But saying that Obama should 'suck on his machine gun' IS a death threat  just like portraying Trump's severed head. If you say anything but  "Yes  Nugent was as wrong as Griffin and both should be held accountable to equal measures " you're one of the dishonest disrespectful partisans you're railing against RE: Trump.,?
4818,Awkward pay raise. Don't you mean these incompetent fools just flipped all of us a big Russian bird. I mean incompetent bureaucrats in Russia giving themselves unearned pay raises it's expected. Incompetent bureaucrats in Lane County are not expected to get a raise for incompetence.,?
4819,I hope you don't have kids if you see this woman's actions as acceptable. And I applaud the den for kicking the kid out.  She brought unwanted negative attention upon them.  However  she will  and is already likely  pay the the price for her stupid stunt.,?
4820,So where are all the Trump trolls?  (Crickets...) Your man Trump is a fraud.  Full stop.  He is an absolute genius at snookering the disadvantaged.  And now he is POTUS!?,?

4822,How much people did they poll? It is portrayed  as if the entire country was polled. Lol.  These polls are about as accurate as the ones that claimed Hillary by a landslide. SMH,?
4823,Pot smell may not get me arrested  but my armpits at the end of a hard day of work might ... ;)  Even if it's the end of the month  their ain't no quota on my oda ... :),?
4824,Ok. I usually don't say this about NCR articles  but this is quite good. For ecumenical dialogue to bear fruit  you need interlocutors are both knowledgeable of and deeply committed to  their own tradition. Only then can differing traditions come together in what philosopher Emmanuel Falque calls "the loving struggle." If everyone is wishy-washy about their own faith  then it merely becomes a "kumbaya" event with very little substance.,?
4825,Republicans should get rid of this clown.  Embarrassing.,?

4827,Cory Gardner is a profile in cowardice,?
4828,I don't know why people  when they don't support a politician  have to get ugly and insulting about it  as this letter does. If you disagree w/their policies why can't you just say that? Human beings sure have a hateful and ugly side. Disgusting.,?
4829,Living comfortably while focusing on my band and screen printing guerrilla art while I work part-time at a bike store is an unassailable right.    With the rising desirability of this area my SNAP benefits  SafeLink Wireless cellphone plan   subsidized apartment rent and TriMet pass are just not cutting it anymore.  I demand an increase in these benefits so that I can afford to live comfortably in this desirable and increasingly expensive city.,?
4830,No  Pence is the Republican sanctimonious hypocrite we know.  Trump is bats##t crazy  the devil we don't know.  Plus  Pence isn't too bright and not popular even in his own state.,?

4842,"“We will start a process where we try and look at how we’re going to make things fairer for those folks and you ” Mr. Trudeau said."  Broken down into its components... “We will start" -kicking the can down the road  "a process" -non-committal "where we try" -no promises "and look" - not "do"  "at how we’re going to" -maybe/eventually/etc  That is a whole lot of backpedaling in a single sentence!  Open and transparent?  OK.  "Real Change"? OK.  What a jerk.,?

4844,"The stunned supporters of Hillary Clinton are still puzzling over why middle- and lower-middle-class voters would leave behind the Democratic Party  which since Franklin Roosevelt has been the party of the common man  in favor of a billionaire reality TV star"  While the Democratic Party has been far better for the common man the the Republican Party  they certainly have not been the party of FDR and the common man for decades.  Many voters weren't sure what Trump would bring but hey new Goldman Girl Hillary Clinton would be bringing more of the same.  Bernie Sanders supporters knew she was a terrible candidate and were not that stunned by Trump's victory  "The question now arises: If Trump fails to deliver  where will Americans turn next for solutions?:"  My guess is they will turn to the progressive populist who si now the most popular politician in America: Bernie  If he doesn't run  which I think he will  they will be looking for another progressive like Elizabeth Warren.,?
4845,Tamura: Disgusting weak minded drivel.  As an Alaskan  you embarrass me.,?
4846,And you read it all  making you exponentially MORE pathetic.,?
4847,Collecting earned income from some Alaskans  while distributing unearned to other Alaskans is called redistribution.  PFD or income tax; not both.,?
4848,Why don't we set up schools for native children where they can be well taken care of  and educated  be given  life enhancing experiences to prepare them to live in a big world with cultures and  peoples other than just their own.  Then when they are adults with  a trade or skill   and know how to fend for themselves   having avoided the decay of alcoholism  drugs  and violence  they can go back to the reserves to live productivity? Ending the cycle of despair ought to be the first priority.,?
4849,Mr. Reguly gives a clear picture of the how dependent corporations are on the public sector  despite the claims of many corporate titans to be independent  self made men.  The city of Toronto has been waiting for years for the delivery of new street cars from this company. Is this public money to help expedite the building of those cars? It seems that that part of the business is of more significance  than the building of executive jets for Trump and his buddies.,?

4858,Are you saying the Devil  not God  created this herb?  Then you're ascribing creative power to Beelzebub rather than God.  Who's mocking God now?    Let's not presume to imagine that Trump (!) and the GOP have a hammerlock on God's favor and blessing.  God would not put Her finest creation on the doorstep of nuclear annihilation thanks to the idiocy of the schlumpf squatting in the Oval Office.  Only Satan plays those kinds of evil tricks on us.,?
4859,We all like our Canada wide health act  OAP  CPP  baby bonus  and what have you. We want clean air  water  and security .But we don't want higher taxes or a larger deficit. Well we can't have it both ways  either we pay more for the things we want or we do without. And if anybody out there in comment land has any real suggestions   lets hear them . I don't like paying taxes any more then rest  but I do like the benefits.,?
4860,The ethics commissioner has not ruled.  The Conservatives demanded the ethics commissioner investigate the Trudeau trip and the  an they ethics commissioner is compelled to respond to that ,?
4861,There is a school of thought that attributes the development of religion to the events generally described as Behavioral Modernity -- an evolutionary leap forward marked by humankind's newfound capacity for symbolic expression and language  as well as the use of tools and religious customs  such as burying the dead. According to this school  an evolutionary development within humankind and our environment brought about a (temporary) adaptation that has caused us to see ourselves and our world in religious-symbolic terms  but will eventually give way to a more comprehensive  less religious-symbolic way of understanding ourselves and our world -- possibly one in which science and the (limited) knowledge available through religious symbolism are merged. In any case  the premise of this school is that religious symbols are always culturally-derived ways of trying to describe ourselves in relationship with a world that remains mysterious  with none of them being "correct.",?
4862,Ask yourself  why is Trump campaigning against his own agenda these days?,?
4863,mark  some of what you say has merit. however  when government steps in and regulates industry to the point it is no longer economical for them to continue operating in this environment  they leave for greener pastures. that means no creation of jobs and no investment opportunity. why would manufacturers continue to operate with higher costs when they can manufacture their products in other countries and ship them back cheaper than they can manufacture the products here? the free markets weed out those products that have no demand and encourage the manufacturing of products with demand  at least until the local regulator shows up and wants their cut of the profits ;),?

4883,Viloria was born and raised in Hawaii - Waipahu to be exact.  His future (outside of the ring) won't need any of us providing him a "nice retirement cushion."  As a college grad with a wealth of business decisions (including big dollar ones) behind him incumbent with any five time world champion  he has and will continue to fare better than most.  As he states consistently - he fights because he is still passionate about the game  and not because he has to.  I've had the honor of working with Ben Villaflor who has served with distinction as the State's Senate's Sergeant-at-Arms for many years.  Given today's many scandals in government  we'll all be lucky if Mr. Villaflor stays on the job for many years to come.  "He [ain't] pretty old by now." as one would suggest - in fact  he can still go ten easy rounds with any of us.,?

I have written several pieces for this opinion section that were well researched  and much more topical and relevant than this piece  and that actually included lot's of verifiable facts from vetted sources. I have had many pieces printed  but the vey best are always ignored and don't get printed. It's because the ADN is nothing but a Right Wing rag now  doing the "pretend liberal thing" like the rest of American media  so it can mislead the voters into pro-corporatist agendas.  Disgusting,?

Like you  never went past high school  which is the major factor that links all Trump voters together.  Also could say low information  willfully ignorant  easily duped.  You know  Fox lapdogs.,?
4893,This guy is either stupid  brain dead  or a liar   think a bit of all.   It is his government’s policies that allow cheap labor to flood into the Canadian IT sector through the Visa program  while at the same time companies like TATA   IBM  Accenture  and CGI  have mandates to offshore 80 % of the work. So the Canadian work force are being fired. He must think we truly are stupid  I guess if you get your news from the CBC or the Liberal Ministry of Propaganda .   While Trump tries to protect U.S. jobs  Junior does nothing  Cami is sending 600 jobs to Mexico yet dumb dumb says nothing. Trump has stopped thousands so far.  Maybe it is small but to those who kept their U.S. jobs Trump will have voters for life.,?
4894,woo hoo..... two loser libs.,?
4895,the NFL union doesn't mind when Black players abuse their wives.,?
4896,Actually..right wing Christians have committed more mass murders in US since 9/11 than Muslims. All generalizations  hate  and fear-mongering aimed at a group of people for the terrible actions of some of them is generally a bad policy and unconstitutional to boot. Totally unacceptable from a public official or media personality.,?
4897,....and makes far too much money for someone being so very stupid....,?
4898,Trump is SUCH an idiot.   On a side note  I am curious what others think of the idea of providing housing for CONgress in DC? Imagine where we buy up a bit of land  fence it in and then build some 600 housing to house CONgress families. Then require that the families be mixed. By that  I mean  that GOP and Dems MUST be mixed up and not segregated.  This way  I would expect occasional block parties  etc  with kids and parents meeting each other and perhaps the CONgress critters will be talking.  These guys used to mix regularly in the evening but no longer do.  So  lets force it.,?
4899,Don't forget to syrup-tishously catalog the mineral s on nearby private and native properties first...don't tell those dumb leggiess where the money came from...they'll never guess....they aren't the curious type....either...,?

4903,Human rights - see UN determination about 2014 or 2015 If Canada doesn't collect stats then don't compare what's missing to the U.S. stats Your 39000 Syrians were the best of the best and not the desperate ones. They were part of the 'Canada is Back' PR campaign.   Why does it take an American to tell you your own recent history? Not to mention 7 people who agree with what you wrote.,?
4904,Absolute rubbish,?
4905,Too many managers and too few front-line healthcare workers  nurses and doctors.  Top heavy management  many have never interacted with a patient in their lives. They decide how to run healthcare. Without having a clue about the ground situation (except from Powerpoint slides in their boardrooms).  We have "managed" ourselves to an unmanageable situation. But no management will ever dump a redundant manager to hire more nurses or increase services. Its become a self defeating system of entitlement and power politics.,?
4906,Ranger  are you calling Alaskan Natives domestic terrorists? Because last time I checked I haven't every heard of any Alaska Native strapping on a suicide vest. I don't see them stockpiling bomb ingredients and building bombs to blow up government agencies and parking garages. I haven't seen any Waco or Ruby Ridge standoffs. I don't see any Aryan Nation race type groups. I haven't heard of any religious cult issues and mass poisoning. So Ranger  tell me what is makes you think Alaskan Natives are "domestic terrorists?" Or is this just racist bullshit you're peddling?,?
4907,You sound like a man whose brain is filled with rock!!!  LOLOL  "rimrock' what a perfect name for you! your parent must be filled with rock to name their son 'rimrock'  pathetic!!!,?

4913,She is so disgusting!,?
4914,So far Trump has lowered the costs and burdens built into the ACA. These women are protesting a change in rules that benefits single women and poor families. Hillary demeaned bill's rape victims  she promoted abortion which most will agree affects women for years after the procedure  Hillary gave essential money to foreign countries and took kickbacks when those funds could have lowered taxes and made the lives of single women easier. Their blind support for feminism is representative of a body of people uninformed and ignorant.,?
4915,I actually like that a private entity held another private entity to a account  albeit for a stupid reason  since this video is a idiotic mockery  nothing more.  That said  Internet anonymity does make some people do thing they would not allow themselves to do publicly  which i guess is both good and bad.  The even bigger question is why the Examiner is wasting time talking about it since it is not (right?) and interested party.  oh wait  we know why....mindelessness.,?
4916,His stance on climate change is his biggest threat and at the end of the day  if we don't have a habitable planet to live on  none of the rest matters.  It's extreme to suggest Trump will destroy the planet all on his own  but the things he promises to do will set progress toward curbing climate change back decades.,?
4917,OldSoul would not address the issues of the board or the facts I reference when posting my opinion  and went straight into juvenile remarks that bring nothing but dysfunction to these boards. Because I responded to his attacks the RG has now censored me twice as all posts must go through their editorial filters  claiming I attacked OldSoul. Their main editor just sent me an email  and I quote: "If you don’t like this  then please take your opinions elsewhere." Curious to note  Gary  everything I have posted in the civil comments forum has been published by the RG in my op-ed letters.,?

4927,George Washington  Thomas Jefferson and most of the signers of the US declaration of independance were all slave holders. They founded a country based upon the proposition that all white men were created equal and all others were sub-human. Should their monuments all be destroyed and their names expunged ?  Abraham Lincoln married into a slave holding family and never considered blacks to be the equal of white men. A sentiment widely held at the time. Should his monuments be eradicated ?  Jean Chretien adopted an aboriginal boy and is therefore guilty of cultural genocide....  ....just how stupid is this current ideology going to get ?,?

Madiba taught us to get past it and we make every effort to do this daily. You lot  yes gupta dot  brought this up and it has now exploded in your faces. Corruption endemic in SA? It has become a major problem  endemic to SA by no means - look at your own doorstep. ALL the corruption currently occurring in SA is by the hand of the Gupta scum. Now  just bugger off!,?
4935,So  in your mind  marriage requires sex  and sex requires marriage--I did read that right  eh?  The final sentence in your comment is not only ridiculous  it's sexist  heterosexist  and extremely offensive.,?
4936,Misogynist,?
4937,Phillips will sell gay couples a standard  out-of-the-cooler  sheet cake. He refuses to design any wedding cake for gay couples. A service he offers to ANY straight couple who walks through the door. That's discrimination. If Phillips refused to design cakes for inter-racial couples you'd be condemning him. But because he refuses to design cakes for gay couples  you're fine with it.,?
4938,yes  shoot back,?
4939,Sick people who have nothing more to do than criticize our First Lady about everything.  Let he/her who is not guilty cast the first stone for being ugly  fat  ugly  drunk  stoner  village idiot and the chorus goes on and on.,?
4940,As most any Trump supporter knows the Administration has several tools on the internet to get information. You can go to White House. Gov or to the Trump website or you can sign up for the newsletter. Unfortunately  these journalists are just trying to accost ( pun intended) the president and his representatives. To the best of my knowledge there is nothing that says that there has to be a press briefing. If the journalists don't like it they are welcome to boycott we can find more.,?
4941,The first word out of a Liberal Losers mouth is always Racist or Bigot !,?
4942,Yeah  rather than elect someone who  15 years ago  in show biz and being egged on by billy said "You can grab 'em by the pussy".  Terrible  Disgusting  Bad.  We need to hire someone a little more civilized.  Like someone that gets a blow job from an intern in the Oral  I mean  Oval Office.,?
4943,I still call my high school football coach from 35 years ago  Coach and I'm still going to Obama  President Obama  but I am going to refer to Trump as "President" Trump using air-quotes every time I say his name.,?
4944,Once again let me remind people that these pro Clinton people who think that Trump will ruin the world beyond repair and who take every opportunity to extend the false narratives that Trump is a racist because he wants to enforce our federal statutes and strengthen our borders  will start WWIII because he is an out of control hot head and is a bumbling idiot based upon God knows what. These are the same people who stuck the world with 8 years of Barrack Hussein Obama ... Please consider all viewpoints but in the end don't forget to consider the source and their track records of picking losers,?
4945,Astonishingly dumb False Equivalence here... did you finish high school?,?
4946,Every one of you idiots who voted for this old clown are responsible for this. Thankfully his reign is nearing an end.,?
4947,Fake news is right  the rest of your post is just stupid.,?
4948,I think all the idiots who voted for Trump should have to pay for his elaborate lifestyle  over and above what a normal president - like Obama - incurred in costs.  I suggest a special tax entitled "You Bought It  You Pay For It."   The Trumpanzees should feel honored to pay for their master. Maybe they can work off their extra tax burden by licking his shoes clean  cleaning his toilets and the like. I think their work should be valued at  say  the minimum wage in Texas  $7.25 an hour.,?
4949,ya right  finally they are increasing taxes based on bs and lies that will do real damage to the economy. The only thing they have done is fool sheep like you https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Smhn1gL6Xg,?
4950,Alternately  Dad expects the kid to behave properly (it's not unreasonable to expect someone not to use the b or c word in polite company  especially at the dinner table) whilst mom is a pushover  and the kid is avoiding dad because teenagers don't like having rules.,?
4951,River is closed to fishing.,?
4952,Why is this questionable Canadian via Iran  yet lied by saying Afghanistan (with the Iranians convincing her to run in the Canadian election during a 2014 visit there) in charge of anything here.  Are we so loose with immigration that we're not vetting enough?  It's time to take the naive glasses off and put our sovereignty first  before the global push for one world government  one world police and court and one world military.  The fact that John McCallum  is partnering up with George Soros on any matter is the most frightening thing I've heard as an old stock Canadian in my life.  Trudeau and Gerald Butts are Soros newest puppets in his bid to destabalize societies around the world so that all can become equal and to take away the advancements of the industialized world  leaving the future ion the hands of the mega rich.  People are such mindless fools for this dangerous sector out there  Trudeau and his amateur hour Government included.  Wake up people.  We're  looking stupid now.,?
4953,Since most interracial rape and homicide are black-on-white  I'd say yes  we need a WLM movement.,?
4954,I rediscovered Vinyl Cafe and Stuart McLean a few years back when my now 12-year-old caught an episode on CBC in the car and locked in immediately. I didn't think he would have been interested since it's a little older-school (a description I intend as complimentary)  but McLean's story-telling and humour resonated with my son just as it has for (I dare say) millions of Canadians.  I bought my boy the hard-cover "Dave Cooks the Turkey" a few Christmases ago and it's become a family tradition since. We read it out loud to one another every Christmas Eve alongside "Twas the Night Before Christmas".  You will be missed Stuart McLean. Missed  but never forgotten.,?
4955,No you don't. You're a Trump fan.,?
4956,If you watch the latest John Oliver video you'll see Ms. LePen at her very best  spouting anti-Semitic threats of tossing a few more Jews into the ovens  etc. She's a thoroughly disgusting person.,?
4957,Yet  more anti-Muslim hatred being spammed even in the wake of the Quebec City shootings.  Disgusting.  We see you  Breitbart/Rebel trolls  and again reject you !!!,?
4958,12 000 years of aboriginal history  with no written records  because none of the First Nations developed written language. When whitey arrived in North  America  the Aboriginals had not yet discovered the wheel.   What could 12 000 years of history of hunter gathers reveal? Was there an aboriginal Plato we don't know about?,?
4959,I can see that point. But one could also point to a narrow win (one of the closest in recent history) in the Presidency  a loss of seats in the Senate and a loss of seats in the House to say that it is a mixed bag. Regardless  a mandate isn't much needed anyway when there is full control! :-),?
4960,John  you are of course correct.  It's is certainly more complicated than "Who is in charge".    However  trickle-down economics coupled with huge military spending increases is basically proven as fiscally irresponsible and very bad for our national debt.    Of course  Trump wants to drastically increase military spending and institute massive tax cuts for the uber-wealthy.  Disgustingly stupid.,?
4961,Allie  you are the disgrace. You call yourself an American? Who are you working for   Putin  Pelosi  Soros  Schumer  Schatz    Chin  Ige? Trump is the President. If you don't like it move. And take your tripe with you. Aloha.,?
4962,NPR tweets the Declaration of Independence;   Trump supporters think it's an insult to Trump   We could probably have a long debate over why the same collections of people that wave confederate flags around  prod for secession defenses to be written into their state party platforms  and demand the dissolution of large parts of the government would presume a recitation of the Declaration of Independence is a threat to their  ahem  movement.   But we won't  because this is all deeply  deeply funny and we're not going to wreck that by parsing it out.,?
4963,I agree. It is also mentioned that he was a special ed teacher.  While the article above doesn't mention it  it is possible it was one of those students.  which would exacerbate the person of trust issue.,?
4964,Yeah  unfortunately  we have way more than our fair share of morons in Alaska. And  they vote.,?

4966,Moore sounds like a dummy but at least has a heart in a good place. I do think he cares about FW. What he plans on doing that I don't know -- chameleon is a good word for it. Flygare... I've met him  and he is a jerk. I don't think for a second he wants to do good for FW  I think he just wants to get elected to something. Probably to make himself feel good. Ill vote for Moore  but I agree: these ain't the most inspiring choices.,?
4967,Khrushchev   'gave' Crimea to Ukraine in 1954 - it was and will always be Russian and only fools or knaves do not recognize this.  Nikita  Khrushchev was a fat-headed ignorant miscreant Ukrainian who was not sadly missed when he died in 1971 - not soon enough according to most Russians!,?
4968,Gee staats   maybe these bullys like mike brown and martin might try being civil and not attacking people. They might live longer and would save me the time explaining their stupidity to you,?

4970,One thing's for sure  if liberals could  they would take away Trump's right to freely speak.,?
4971,Racism  fascism  Islamophobia  Anti-Semitism  Homophobia and any laws restricting Transgenders must be eliminated period. We all must get behind Justin  Obama  Hillary and Premier Wynne to defeat Trump and his fascist supporters!,?
4972,I know I wouldn't scream like a little b*tch and then run around the plane like spastic mental patient.  Loser FELON got what he deserved  if you ask me.,?

4974,Do they teach this at Ivy?,?
4975,So now  President Moron Trump will come out and say Senator Flake cannot win an election for dog catcher !! Only problem is  the MORON forgets how MANY times he lot elections until  unbelievably  he wins the Presidential election on the 4th or 5th try !!! Scary thing is  Moron lost as a Democrat  so he changes to Republican and WINS !!!  What does THAT say about the Republican Party. I've been a card carrying Republican since I graduated rom college  but THIS Republican Party is NOT the party I grew into as a voting adult !!! This Party is a shameful  bigoted  mysogonistic  Constitutional violator  incestuous  backwards looing  bunch of fools who cower in fear of the Moron President !!!,?
4976,They come to see Trump like a comedic clown!,?

4978,Who is the king? - It was some gangster who one day  some time ago  stood up and said " I am in charge! I own this place! You don't like it? I WILL KILL YOU!" - The queen is just his wife. They keep power like this generation after generation. They even make it law that you can't criticize a royal or you are sent to prison for 20 years. If they don't like you  you will simply disappear. They have ultimate wealth and power - greater than any business man or politician - you can never get rid of them.   People who worship royalty are fools.,?
4979,Exactly; it's the same old  same old.,?
4980,Thanks for the article Scott  I will have a look at my portfolio over the weekend. Maybe do some rebalancing.,?

4987,Ms. Elkins  I would encourage you to not take Mr. Struck's comments at face value. As outlined in my comment  please visit the MICA website  read about the project and see the extensive answers to many questions. Email us with additional questions. The City also has a FAQ on its website. Thanks for your consideration.,?
4988,I could truly care less which side you strongly believe in.  Not only is it your right but our postings have zero effect on the final outcome.  But if you're too stupid to grasp the basic issues or understand the difference between work rules and constitutional provisions  then your posts are nothing but emotional rants.  You actually quoted the constitution perfectly without the vaguest idea of what it means.  The first word of which is Congress and they aren't party to any of this.,?
4989,I hope both our senators will oppose passage so a bill such as this  that affects millions of Americans  that has been drafted in back rooms in a direct assault on our democratic process. Obamacare  which the AHCA hopes to replace  was subject to months of scrutiny by Congress and the public before it was passed. Voters have a right to be heard on any legislation w such a major impact on their lives!,?
4990,In one of my career choices  I had to make regular reports to higher level supervisors.    At about that same time  'Dynamic Data Exchange' and linked spreadsheets became available.  It is amazing how easy it is to massage the basic data to 'improve' one's statistics--especially if the 'improved' statistics make either your boss or his boss(es) look better!  "Liars  damned liars and statistics!",?
4991,Omg shut up.  Is this a blm post.  No.  Has anyone from blm ever brandished a weapon while going on about homeless people.  No.  If this was a blm article would it have ended diffrently.  Yes...go back in your cave troll,?
4992,Some folks like to pretend that paying rent makes a person less than them.  Those folks are really stupid  aren't they?  (I mean the ones that think they are better than someone who pays their bills - like the rent.

4994,Another propaganda piece ... Chinese don't hold NK let alone drop it? They follow the UN rule  as simple as that. It is like to say that Ukraine blames German and US for the loss of Crimea since they don't fight Russia enough  or American blame Mexico for Cuba being too hostile  ridiculous.,?

4996,Bork doesn't equal anything about Garland.,?
4997,Idiots  I am unsure  but don't understand statistics  most probably  yes.  As a country  we don't do a great job at education  especially on things like statistics  we are also kinda lazy when it comes to finding out facts.  People hear that a candidate won a poll  but don't take the time to look at by how much and what the margin of error is.,?
4998,They need to take this guy to the exact spot and push him off the same cliff 😲,?
4999,Not a single NRA member was involved in this shooting.  You are a blankenyblank idiot.,?
5000,Thank you for a well done piece  my husband and I have been having this discussion. He feels let down that the country of his youth no longer exists. I have been trying to express that the country of our youth has created what we are experiencing today. Just as today will create our tomorrows. Each generation has the choice and obligation to look at where we will be down the road and to work for the future we need and desire. The past   is for remembering and respecting  not reverting to.,?
5001,Yep  the Russians are laughing all right......at the incompetent clown in the WH and the minority of voters who fell for his con man scheme.,?
5002,A useful story but I worry when programs like this serve more to divide people than to emphasize what we all have in common.  Identity theory has its limits.  We are home in God's hands  not in the hands of any culture in this world./,?
5003,What a monumental jerk. Too much entitlement in his background. Careless disregard for lives of juveniles; he should be at the receiving end of a little of his own medicine.,?
5004,Ignorant press ask the same question in ways specifically to cause controversy between statements of President Trump and his staff. They are so concerned about how the words spoken instead of what he was saying MSM is as useless as tits on a bull,?
5005,You are a pathetic narrow minded person who hides behind the American flag  probably hides behind the robes of Jesus  and live a wretched life to boot.,?
5006,Sore loser.   Arse whooping!!!,?
5007,Which is his duty  but really. I think whatever Democrat were to run would win.  No republican seems the least-bit interested.  More like abdication  the same as they do in Denver.,?
5008,This one crosses the line for me.    "A skit performed in a south Texas high school English class that portrayed the assassination of Donald Trump is just one of the latest cases of K-12 election hysteria.   Officials at San Antonio’s Marshall High School claim they took "appropriate action" following the skit  in which a student dressed as Trump was shot by a classmate  complete with gunfire sound effects from a cellphone.",?
5009,I cannot believe EVEN  A LIBERAL GOVERNMENT  would PAY  CONVICTED TERRORIST 10 MILLION DOLLARS   and don't give that b.s. he was only 15  FACTs: he was fighting for the terrorist    he killed an American soldier   he blinded another American soldier  as Stupid Justin T. claims a canadian is a Canadian  is a Cnadian   well a TERRORIST  IS A TERRORIST IS A TERRORIST AND HE SHOULD BE PUT IN JAIL IN CANADA FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE  NOT REWARDED WITH A 10 MILLION DOLLAR PAYMENT  and if he is to be pid 10 million  it should be paid out of the salaries of the liberal M.PS  and all the loud mouth's out there could also chip in and help in the payment.  CANADA AS WE KNOW IT  AND WAS PASSED ON TO US BY OUR FATHERS WILL NOT LAST ANOTHER 15 YEARS   THIS IS DISCUSTING  ,?
5010,Your ignorance is apparent to all. Mom gets meals on wheels because she can't get off her butt and make dinner. Do you have empathy or compassion for anyone?,?
5011,Pondering it won't get me your answer.,?
5012,so the russia lie has been exposed along with the obstruction bs he is accused of as well as the lies from cnn so its time to make up the next bull crap and claim trump wants war.. how pathetic and desperate the lunatic left wing mind is  keep crying as you continue to lose  lose    lose,?

5020,Adscam found the LPC guilty of misappropriating tax payer funds to the benefit of the liberal party.  Never having paid that money back  the party soon fell into dismal financial times once their paws were removed from the public check book  they were defeated and broke.    Back in power  they are scrambling with various means to fill the coffers .. Cash for access; carbon taxes from which they'll steal a poin or two in the handling; infrastructure funding through LPC hookup companies and again a point or two to shave.  Don't forget the union kickbacks for favours done ... unions doing the political advertising for the LPC.   And the LPC will smile while they do it  relying upon simple minded hate filled voters who will vote ABC not caring about the consequences.,?
5021,UAS has less than 1 000 full time students and the revenue to full time student ratio is $55.9k:1 If you are trying to make the point that the administration is cost inefficient  I think you chose a poor comparison point.   60% of UA's budget is staff cost  and staffing is likely the easiest place to reduce expenditures. Cut management salaries/positions  reduce tenured positions or negotiate a wage cut for professors  sell unnecessary buildings  contract out positions where cost inefficiencies can be realized...  As a student  I can tell you that my best teachers have been the ones that have full time jobs in the communities  and teach a class or two a semester in addition. The tenured professors that I have had  across the board  have been awful. Perhaps tenure reduces incentives to perform at a high level? Or  people who work outside of academia are better at teaching?,?
5022,They just say that to get your stupid vote don't believe them.,?
5023,Yep. "I'm an ugly  white loser of a male  with a sense of entitlement greater than my actual abilities and knowledge. Uppity women and brown people are taking what is rightfully mine.",?

5025,That is why I changed my account name  so that this sicko is now exposed for the sick person that they are.,?
5026,The taxable/non-taxable issue is really a simple fix if anyone cares to introduce legislation. Likewise a lifetime cap to insurance company obligation  with excess cost for the relatively few who need it covered by a government pool could restore some stability and reduce policy costs across the board. Too simple?  As for Rosen's argument  I haven't read it because the man irritates me no end both in his writing and his ED commercials on radio. However  it would not surprise me if employers pay the same amount for every employee in a group policy  and the difference in cost for single vs married vs married with children is reflected only in the employee's share of cost. So $10K per employee (as an example) and single employee chips in another $2K  married an extra $3K  married w/kids $4K.,?

5029,You can keep raising taxes on the Chinese with higher and higher annual taxes on non-residents until they start selling and quit coming here.   This is what the author thinks the NDP will do.   They don't want to own houses here if it get too expensive from a tax standpoint.   Prices will then drop.,?
5030,What a joke. The media refuses to come out and say this loser was simply a left wing nut extremist who hated the president and any conservatives. They will try their hardest to tie this to terrorism instead. The media in this country is a pool of tur ds. They hate America just as much as he did.,?
5031,With you until the dot dot dot 'snark' you just had to throw in there. Many of us did not agree with McCain  myself included  but never would I sneak in snarky in a heartfelt "such a sad story" item. Just shaking my head here  dot dot dot.,?
5032,I voted no on this budget.  The biggest reason is the use of reserve funds - spending our savings account just because it is available.   It has taken has taken the City 5  years to rebuild our reserves after the recession.  We know that best practice is two months of operating expense in reserve or about 16%.  We will be at 13%.   Our capital needs are significant and this budget does not acknowledge that and draws from the money that has been set aside.   This budget does not provide sustainable funding for our failing parks system.  It is simply a band-aide which does not allow for ongoing upkeep and repair of our existing parks. We cannot continue to ignore the problem or promise we will deal with it later.  This budget is not the bold move our city deserves.  It is a placeholder that just moves problems down the road.  A vital  vibrant city includes streets  police and parks.  We must do our best to provide all of these services - our residents and businesses deserve that.,?
5033,Rail fiasco aside  I want to see the current mayor unseated for his ethical "lapses" alone and the sham board job at the bank that he wouldn't have even gotten were he NOT mayor!  ANY honorable leader (few and far between) would have NEVER accepted that sham "job" knowing the conflict that would arise  appearances and the loss of confidence from the citizenry.

5044,(TWO)  Our physical being and knowledge  (to adopt your turn of phrase) is limited above all by the fact they evolve. We humans obviously evolve physically and intellectually both during our individual lives (that's easy to see)  and also as a species over time (a bit more complex to grasp).   Just as our parents and teachers (assuming they are wise!) adjust what they say to us according to their perception of our capacity to understand  so to the Holy Spirit adjusts what she says to us as our species develops intellectually over time (and she is wise!).  We urgently need a new way of doing theology that accepts this reality. I find that in Bernard Lonergan's "Method in Theology." Unfortunately  in order to understand in depth what Lonergan means in that comparatively easy read  one must first understand his epistemology in his much more challenging "Insight: A Study of Human Understanding."   I was blessed in my 20s to be introduced into the latter by a Jesuit colleague of Lonergan's.,?
5045,Garbage decision.   Power play by OIA.   This is HIGH SCHOOL sports. These administrators treat Football like they are NFL owners. Paying public should boycott attending games.  Will force administrators to rethink their GARBAGE decision.  Students are the losers.,?

Anybody who does take pause over such common Muslims attitudes is just a bigot  Islamophobe. Antisemitism is something only white people are guilty of because  Muslims say kill all Jews with love in their hearts.,?
5049,Anything a foreign government that falls into espionage needs to be dealt with; period Voter claiming they need not be concerned are not the ones I want making decisions or investigating the issue.

5053,hmm. If king was to return to Africa  he could help them.  After all  we ALL ultimately came from Africa.   OTOH  I suspect that he will not want that  any more than these kids (yes  some are now adults) want to leave what they consider to be THEIR nation.,?

5056,But if you listen to what he says  his plan is to change the tax code which currently benefits guys like him.  Who knows better how to close loopholes than the man who currently benefits from them?    You sound a little jealous of Mr. Trump's success.  Meanwhile  the Clintons enjoy the same tax break that Mr. Trump does by making speeches - not one job created - and you think that's a better candidate.  Envy is not a good trait.,?

5059,Lets see where in my comment did I say I supported the Clintons? oh NO WHERE! MyOpinion let me give you my opinion  the maximum effective range of an excuse is zero! Bankruptcy to the rest of us means freeloader means you won't pay your bills and it is nothing to brag about or take lightly. I certainly do not want a POTUS who fails to pay his bills  I pay mine. Whats more what does that mean in business it means you are a failure and you suck at your job.  Yes  the tax system sucks but I rememeber when people looked down on others who were tax evaders  now it's a badge of courage for the GOP? I pay my taxes buddy that is what real Americans do  they pay for things they use like oh roads  bridges  post offices schools. Where do you think this big ass miltary Mr Trump wants other to pay for comes from TAXES!!!! 60% of all taxes in fact at least my taxes.,?

5074,The news story fails to report accurately the main fact  the $3 billion shortfall is only an ESTIMATE!  Considering the past ability of the Caldwell administration to inaccurately ESTIMATE the rail project up to now  one can easily expect that the shortfall may be significantly higher  more likely $7 billion.  That is why the State Legislature is extremely reluctant to pass any further tax hikes for Caldwell.  The legislators have absolutely no confidence that Caldwell's ESTIMATE will be only $3 billion.,?

5084,Just another state ruled by Republican  heavily government-subsidized farmers  ranchers  oil and gas living on their giant estates voting against all taxation while sucking up the government cash.  Fundamentalist christian theocrats ruling over every city  county  and state governing system as they ban abortions  defund all social programs  and maintain the working classes in indentured servitude.  All while proclaiming how "friendly" they all are  except of course if you are non-white or refuse to "believe".  The state was ruled by Anaconda from its inception and is now ruled by other Corporate dictators owning the majority  of the lands where Republicans reign supreme.  One small area around Missoula is a shrinking bastion of human rights.  The rest of the state is harcore racist  bigotted  and stupid.  Time for a Revolution to wrest the nation from these Republican fascists.,?

5092,Disgusting  repulsive  and other similar adjectives. The hypocrisy of the hijacked Republican Party  along with the now completely irrelevant Evangelicals  who eagerly climbed into bed with the devil  knows no bounds. A laughing stock if it weren't for the crying over the dearth of decency  and the divisive  guttural garbage coming from what I can only describe as a mentally ill candidate  hell-bent on creating a new (facist) Trump Party  who says: 'to the devil' with all decent Republicans  who have already bravely disenfranchised themselves from what will go down in history as the most disgraceful presidential candidate ever. Make your stand Alaska. Your vote is "Wheat from the Chaff" time  so stand up and be counted!,?
5093,Gardner is not a leader.  He's a republican sycophant with a nice smile.  He will vote for whatever McConnell wants  and hide from his constituents  as usual.  He won't be growing a spine any time soon.,?
5094,Funny thing is as a democrat we know republicans are stupid. We don't need a reason for trump either but he should be and his family should be beheaded like Kathy Griffith showed us.   As democrats we really hate republicans. We own the majority of people anyways so it's all a matter of using them to do our protests too.  Pretend to dress like the republican and pretend to say how trump is great is while making white supprimimist symbols and we can fool others into thinking republicans and whites are racist and hateful. We will destroy America from the inside. Support democrats or we will find your town next.,?
5095,There is no group in this country more opportunistic and more hypocritical than the leadership of the right-wing Evangelical movement. These are the people who  with straight faces  endorsed Donald Trump for president because they "believe" he's a sincere Christian. In a pig's eye.  John Hagee values Jews in Israel the same way a chess player values pawns. They're useful at a certain point in the game  but ultimately expendable.,?

5097,Mr. Baskett  what you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard.

I award you no points  and may God have mercy on your soul.,?
5098,Wall mismanages the budget and then goes after the workers to repair his incompetence. Only a dumb con would accept that. It wouldn't be that too many gifts to big oil were at fault  or that taxes were artificially low just to pander to the stupid and have them believe that Wall actually was a fiscal genius? Wall rode the oil boom for a while; he will ride out on the oil bust.,?
5099,Good thinking gang ... everyone should vote for the candidate who is on record as saying these things:   Hillary’s actual words  with source information by Christina Plantz‎ 1) “Where is the God damn flag?

Just do your Goddamn job and keep your mouth shut.” Hillary to her State Trooper 3) (3) “If you want to remain on this detail  get your fucking ass over here and grab those bags!” Hillary to a Secret Service Agent 4) (4) “Stay the fuck back  stay the fuck back away from me! Don’t come within ten yards of me  or else! Just fucking do as I say  Okay!!?” Hillary screaming (5) “Where’s the miserable cock sucker?” (otherwise known as “Bill Clinton”) Hillary shouting at a Secret Service officer  CONT'D,?

5102,O'Leary will go down to ignominious defeat if the CPC is foolish enough to elect him.  His confrontational style won't play well with most Canadians; he has shown profound ignorance of the Charter of Rights with the misintepretation of the notwithstanding clause  and his French is pathetic.  Bernier will scare the bejesus out of anyone who isn't a libertarian  and his fiscal platform clearly reveals ignorance of both economics and basic arithmetic.  If the CPC isn't smart enough to anoint a more moderate candidate  Trudeau and Butts will have a mighty easy job come 2019.  Either of the CPC frontrunnerss will alienate centre rightists  and the NDP has their own problems finding anyone with leadership mettle --  meaning the centre left vote won't see enough of a split to pull of a Harperite victory.,?

5105,Just to give one example.  Middlebury faculty and students admitted that basically none of them had read Charles Murray's works.  Nevertheless they felt obliged to shout him down so that he could not be heard.  Then Dr Murray and the head of the political science department were physically assaulted by the Alt-left group and  the Middlebury professor had to go to hospital for treatment.  Dr Murray  FYI  was entirely civil.  The Middlebury crowd was not.  Later a petition circulated among Middlebury faculty and administrators which advocated  the right to free speech did not get a majority.  And the students who disrupted the event and physically attacked two academics were not punished.  You seem to think that because private institutions are not public they have no expectation of free speech  but that is to deny the whole purpose of a liberal arts education: to be exposed to a variety of opinions and viewpoints.  You would like American to become like North Korea.  Pity.,?
5106,The end of the baby boom echo should have reduced demand while increasing supply as baby boomers down size.  The injection of foreign investor buyers and money changes that dynamic.  Even in the USA we see Foreign money flowing in to be laundered. See the Paul Manafort indictment.,?
5107,If a tribe comes by land other than "their reservations before ANCSA" can those lands be put into trust under these rules?  This is the issue I was getting at with the ambiguity in the article.  Some tribes have received land from either 14c3 and ANCSA Corps  and if this land could be taken into trust  it should be made clear.  Keep in mind that the regional corps that own land are also made up of the same rolls as the tribes in the region.  Also  there is real potential for "regional tribes" to come into existence  which could facilitate regional corp lands going into trust.    The real issues is are the 44 million acres in question going to be governed under state law  or federal laws.  It could even be possible that if land was in trust the feds on behalf of the "owners"  that management of fish and game on those lands could come under tribal/federal control.  People should be concerned.   As far as land being accepted; governments never turn down opportunity to gain power.,?
5108,Garbage vehicle  stay away from this junk.,?
5109,We  as a nation  can't agree that PHYSICAL healthcare is a right  much less MENTAL healthcare. If Rethugs were truly fiscally-conservative they'd see that one wrongful death lawsuit against the city from a falling body would cost them far more than fencing.  We spend 53% of every tax dollar on our military -- one that can't even protect us against 19 guys with box cutters. The Pentagram  er  'gon can't even account for $5 TRILLION. W's (& Oblahma's) senseless wars on Afghanistan & Iraq (& Libya & Syria) have cost ~$7 TRILLION to avenge the deaths of ~3 000 on 9/11  but we are still fighting over whether to provide basic health insurance that could save over 45 000 lives a year  thanks to Rethuglican cruelty. The cost of NOT fencing is too high.  We can't have both empire for corporate profit abroad and a healthy society at home. Perhaps if we could just agree that at least our leaders need mental health care....,?

5129,No  in socialism the state owns the corporations; in extreme corporatist capitalism  which is what the world is plagued with now  corporations own the government.  By owning and running the government  corporations in effect own the people. Thus we are burdened with wage slavery.   If Norway and Sweden are socialist by your reckoning  socialism is what the world needs.,?
5130,It's really 8 thru lanes (4 each way)  with some spots where there's an extended merge lane.    No  adding capacity does not increase traffic congestion.  Just the opposite is true.  It commonly adds more VEHICLES (from people shifting over from alternate routes when the highway improves  which in turn improves the congestion on those alternate routes).  But increasing vehicles and increasing the degree of congestion are not the same thing  and you're confusing them.  A 33% increase in capacity (by going from 3 lanes to 4 for  for instance) is still an improvement in congestion even if there's a 10% increase in the # of vehicles on that highway.  What's creating the congestion is the rapid increase in POPULATION. Our road capacity is not keeping up with the rate of population growth.    As I said above  there are some cases where transit works well  like express bus service to downtown where you have a major high-volume endpoint.,?

5141,"We pay $46 a barrel for BP to pump ours."  And we just take their word for it  no audits needed.  FERC caught them inflating transportation costs  so oil taxes had to be redone.  But the legislature is dragging their feet on audits and haven't even collected the billions already owed. https://www.adn.com/energy/article/oil-audit-draft/2014/11/20/ https://www.adn.com/business-economy/2017/02/05/energy-royalty-audits-and-adjustments-brought-alaska-an-additional-117-million-in-2016/  Instead all they can do is take money from Alaskans...to pay oil tax credits...

5145,I am not sympathetic. I did everything I possisbly could to get a grad degree so I could be a journeyman educator. I wanted to be an educator at Nome or Anatuvik Pass etc. Couldn't get anyplace in Alaska though.  I had a 3.8 undergraduate average and U.A.F. denied me admission 3 times. I graduated cum laude from U.A.S.E.  with an A.A. and a B.A. from Excelsior College. It was not possible to save 15 000 cash to afford tuition for an M.A. and expenses  nor could I get any sort of work with the state of Alaska.  I tried to move forward 20 years without luck. Fundamentally I now support vouchers from the state to fund private schools because the unions of Alaska are .... coursera.org has thousands of free college courses that are really  really useful regarding learning-though not accredited.,?

5148,This is irresponsible "journalism" and your so-called "experts" are brainwashed by mainstream thinking as well as dairy propaganda. Ethics aside - as we know the horrors that happen in the non-Vegan "food" industry" as well as the impact on climate change - more and more real experts promote an exclusively plant-based diet at ALL stages of life for health as well as longevity.

They are are getting tossed to fuck out of a Country for a change instead of being  welcomed with open arms.     They are not  being shown the open door because of Racism.     They are being given the boot because they  lack the ability to co-exist with any Native  Population.       The WEST could learn a LOT  from  Myanmar.,?

5159,Now  that he's off the bandwagon for the inevitable "11 wins in a row" (while contributing to the equal probability of 11 losses in a row)  another mediocre effort (game rating of 53)  I suppose that Egoman is anxious to redirect the blame with his blister issue.  Never a man with any humility  his self declaration of being at his best with this start  is a stretch. Deflection of his previous 9 ER in 9 IP against the Yanks in his last two appears to be his goal.  Shut up and pitch  please.,?

One a rapist and a serial adulterer and the other a proven liar and most probably a crooked lawyer.     So you fought for the losing Team  and now you hope Canada makes the same mistake you did.  Guess what?  We already did.  We don't have Trump  we've got Chump.,?

5170,WOW!!! I do not have Islamaphobia.  I know Sharia Law.  That commands all TRUE believers to convert or kill all of us (you and me) infidels (people who don't believe in the TRUE Muslim faith. They have been killing each other for the last 1000 years based on the separation of Sunni's and Shiite's.  Now  for some basic English  you need to know a "Phobia" is an irrational fear of something.  I think it's reasonable to fear anyone that wants to kill me just because I don't believe EXACTLY as they do.  To suggest Islamaphobia is a form of antisemitism  is IDIOTIC.  Jews are the main target of Muslims. Are you an ostrich or just a dupe?,?

5178,First off - President Obama was fairly elected by the MAJORITY.  He is qualified  dignified  intelligent and a good leader.  He also inherited an economic disaster and 2 wars on credit card. The economy has always done better under Democrats.  I miss him as President.  Despite unyielding Republican ostructionism and tRump demanding his papers  he maintained composure and focus on his job.,?
5179,So we have a high ratio 1st mortgage (90-95%) with the long-suffering taxpayer sitting in second position on the title. Who takes the hit if the market declines by 10% or more  (not beyond imagining) and there is a default?,?

5182,The very fact that Hillary and Trump are the front runners is ample proof of why our Founders did not want the United States to be a democracy. They founded a REPUBLIC in hopes that idiots couldn't elect other idiots to office. They failed.,?
5183,Yup.  Of course making A is easier for you than appearing intelligent. Much more natural.,?
5184,I can't read your mind  so make your comments understandable. I didn't say that but yea sure. The sick twisted in the head terrorists full of pure evil and hatred should be tortured for their information and then executed. They won't mind a bit  they believe they are going to a happy place. And certainly don't turn them loose to do bad things all over again like your President is fond of doing.,?
5185,Yeh  there's only been 2 fatal shootings since it was approved... But whose counting.,?
5186,The funds to build this ridiculous wall are included in the military spending bill because no member of the house or senate is stupid enough to support spending money specifically for the wall.  So much for the idiot-in-chief's promise to have Mexico pay for the wall.,?

Hold my beer and watch this!" I was taught that our freedom meant you could do whatever you want  unless it harmed others. I still believe that.  The Quebec legislation is an attack against us all.,?

5197,Yes  that is what you stated. No  it is not accurate. As I pointed out  the Polish bishops  especially the future St John Paul II  were not only at the Vatican II Council  but were major contributors.  You’re relying on a secondary source  a source critical of St. John Paul II  the Polish Church  and its implementation of Vatican II and it shows.,?
5198,"So if a man leaves he's a loser and if she leaves him...he's a loser."  Well  sure  it's in keeping with the baseline supposition:   If a man despises women  he's an a-hole; if a woman despises men  it's because men are a-holes.  Feminists do have a kind of consistency going there  it's just not what you'd call rational.,?
5199,Check out the science and you will find that Caribou are not threatened because of anything human -created.   Enviro's do not want you to know that  as it will be a negative to their revenue stream from gullible donors.  Listen to the people who live in forested communities for once.  They understand nature.,?
5200,Put an orange wig on that pig and Trump'er up.,?
5201,It's problematic to view this polarization as JUST something we can pin on the president*. The Republicans have been working very hard and for decades on this polarization.   We can trace the heritage back to things like the Birchers  through Reagan's repeal of the Fairness Doctrine  to the rise of hate radio and Faux "News"  as well as fake news outlets like InfoWars and Breitbart  and Newt's intentional instruction of GOPAC and machinations to divide the parties  even in Washington. The right has created an alternative media with their own set of "facts" and a culture that won't even listen to the other side  much less create empathy for their position.,?
5202,Sure  Joe.,?
5203,What's even sadder is that most Americans don't try to stop the senseless killing of our servicemen and women in these unnecessary wars.  Trump's a moron for saying what he did  but ignoring the killing makes that look like small potatoes.,?
5204,Yes and we can move that much quicker to Oceania.  Disgusting.,?
5205,I don't think studded tires are to blame for tearing up all the roads  what about our weather we get  nasty pouring down rain  heavy wet snow and the plow trucks  I'm just saying we have to take into consideration that just not the studded tires.   Another way to get us for taxes...keep adding  em on....,?
5206,Trump brand is toxic. It stands for intolerance  divisiveness  greed as well as stupidity.  Who wants to frequent a place that attracts controversy or even danger.,?

5214,RangerMC  You admit that nobody was harmed by DACA.  Lots of people were helped by it.  Trump had no business rescinding it.,?
5215,It's because they can't govern.  And having a complete moron at the top of the ticket isn't helping either.,?
5216,What do you know about our Troops other then what you're told to say  did you serve your Country Jake???,?
5217,Yes  Putin can charm the pants off the unwary.  It's those killer blue eyes!,?
5218,According to the article (second to last paragraph)  people in the south apparently do get aid to keep cool on "blazing hot summer days".,?
5219,Sheryl8  you need to look into the personal beliefs and religious affiliations of more conservatives. Many (not all) are anti-gay or many (not all) play to the percentage of the base that is anti-gay. You know this.  You sound like a fiscal conservative. Social conservatives are different.  You know that too. Trost is running to lead a party that will field a leader that might bring us the next PM.  Hardly a minor figure. He is clearly fair game  especially for satirical treatment for such a ridiculous position.,?
5220,Just further evidence that Trump's communications are full of bull excrement. Even sadder  the buffoon can't even lie consistently. We go from "CEOs are lining up to be on my Councils" to disbanding them outright. In no one's wildest dreams did anybody anticipate THIS much failure and incompetence.,?
5221,So I'm not clear (since my "stupid" seems to be at full mast)  did you quote Bush to prove Iraq was a state sponsor of terrorism or not?  You quoted him like it was the truth  than call it garbage.  Or are you just typing stuff to be ornery?,?
5222,The Buffoonest in Chief.,?
5223,What a stupid comment,?
5224,What is the "mining haul road" referenced as being shut down "temporarily" -- is this Willow Fishhook Road by chance? What other road could it be? Why is this not specified in this article nor more specifics as to what is meant by "temporary closure" ??? What happened to investigative journalism? These articles whereby info is just told as it is has been given  without any true investigative disclosures  holds little usable value.   If the road in secrecy is in fact a public road as popular as Willow Fishhook  that closure of any length of time is out of the question. How can we -- RESIDENTS who use this road for recreation  hunting and quick getaways for a few hours  berry picking  mining on our claims and fishing  etc -- protest this?   We're sick of these non-Alaska companies exploiting our resources  shutting down our roads  destroying our access to wilderness and wildlife  interfering with and frequently preventing our interests for their own profit. "Jobs creation" is a ruse.,?
5225,Some suggestions:  (1) translate into the other 10 official languages (2) add stock pictures to put faces to names (3) make available as audio books (4) play widely on all radio stations.   Reading excerpts or rough tranlations of excerpts on talk show stations is a good interim measure.,?
5226,Disgusting act.  Killing animals who pose no threat to you "because you can" .. utterly wrong.  Some say stupid  I say wrong.  Also  apparently it is against the law.,?

5228,Frankly  I don't think base rates should go down. We have way too much debt to tolerate another tax cut. Eliminate all the tax deductions  raise the standard deduction to compensate  and leave rates where they are. Then maybe (maybe!) we can actually finance some of our govt spending responsibly.,?

5231,You just made a fool of yourself - weed had nothing to do with his horrific torture of this child.  Those open sores are a result of METH use.  Btw  weed is legal now - try to have a better understanding of the effects before you connect it again to another heinous crime such as this.  We should all wish that "weed" would become the recreational drug of choice over meth  heroine  prescription pills and YES  alcohol! Never knew a pothead that tortured a child.,?
5232,Let's hope so.  Damb Liberals!,?

5234,The Mayor of Vancouver should read this...he promised "zero homeless by 2015.....oops....later after he failed miserably...actually more homeless under his watch...he said it is too big a problem just for a city...I agree...but oh how he changed his tune  not because he got wiser....when he made the promise it was smoke and mirrors and he knew it  once the mirror cleared...and he had to face the problem...he punted.,?
5235,The inflation rate is 3%  so with a 0.5% interest rate  real interest rates are negative. This seems to me to be another example of authorities appearing to be doing something but in fact are doing nothing. There will be a lot of talk about this but at the end of the day this change will have little effect on the UK economy. I think this is were the expression 'fake news' has some salience.,?

You both are welcome additions to Colorado  and if I ever get a chance to buy you guys a beverage I totally would ...   Long time boyfriend girlfriend huh ... you guys should get married out here in Colorado you obviously are good souls that found each other ;)  I had a rescue dog for 12 years (RIP) that once took after birds in a wildlife refuge in WA state (Stillicum Beach  Bellingham WA) I was away attending a funeral for a childhood friend  left the dog with my friends which was a big mistake (I only kennel my dogs now).  I spent 2.5 weeks searching for her on the Puget Sound  I peed on corners near the house of those that lost her while staying in their garage suspecting she might make her way into town searching.  Sure enough  one morning  she was sitting on the front porch of this house when I woke up ... dogs are TOUGH and I love 'em.,?

Good thing it appeared late Friday afternoon  giving readers Fri. night and all day Saturday to fulminate about where Saunders stands on the politics of the issue  "fake news" (cliche of the day) and  oh  yes  "no discussion at all about first causes..." as one commenter puts it.  Yeah  yeah.    Not too many words spoken in support of the implications of this...ummm  civil war?  Dirty war?  Whatever... "The refugee camps will become permanent cities." Some--in Turkey--feel and operated pretty much that way right now. When do the Turks (and maybe the Greeks) take the kind of action France did on "the Jungle"?  You want to see atrocities? What France decided to do (demolish a camp of 3 000 and get campers some kind of aid) might be a model of restraint.,?

My question - "How many of the people covered by this 'travel ban' have "...violated our immigration laws."?" was asking why he conflated the "TWO Separate issues.". . And my question to you is this. Why didn't you call out DigitalDrifter when he conflated the "TWO Separate issues.".,?

5259,The defenders of imaginary budget cuts refuse to identify how they would cut $750 million to $1 billion over the next three years and how that would not make the recession longer and deeper. Either provide details now or drop the subject.  I will identify what needs to be cut   telecommute all legislative and state business that can be done from home   cut staffing across the board  just look at performance reviews. cut UAA  cut schools to 1/2 cut the ferries cut entitlements cut the troopers cut pensions cut airports cut state vehicles of all sorts  stop any road or civil engineering projects do an across the board % of whatever is left  The recession will continue and get worse  government spending is not a long term solution we need to scale back. we can no longer afford a lot of the services the state and people think we are entitled to. We would not have a recession if we were not overgrown and overspent to start with. No more boom and bust.,?

Your statement carries the rotting stench of white trash racism. I'd pay to see you take a DNA test to determine your origins that will include minorities. I'd bet on it.,?
5264,The author protests too much. On ATI  it is far easier for the opposition to promise transparency than for government to find it has no embarrassments to hide. On native issues  there is no way "all 94" recommendations of any commissions can be practical to implement  and the new inquiry is more of a public grief-listening process rather than a useful study on how to prevent deaths in the future.   On the economy  conservatives usually resort to accounting tricks to balance the budget  as they try to cut taxes and spend more on the military.  The file that was really fumbled was electoral reform  which needed a seasoned minister to shepherd through. But handing it to a rookie minister was the big mistake.,?

5270,Almost $2000 a month for that place? What are normal apartment rents? Is it because they can't come up with a security deposit  or first and last months rent that they choose to live in that dump? I know rents have gone up but that is ridiculous.,?

5275,Not a very well researched or written news article.  For example  what was the extent of the victim's injury if any? The article reports that the incident was classified by the police as a burglary but how can that be as the assailant did not attempt to enter the victim's home at any time.  Should it not have been classified as an assault and criminal trespass instead??,?

5286,From a procedural point  President Obama did not rename Denali.  Authority to name mountains rests with the Board of Geographic Names.  If that board does not act on a name change in a reasonable amount of time  then the Interior Secretary has the power to act on the request that has not been acted on.  Secretary Jewel used her authority on a request that had been stalled for a long time.  For Trump's new Interior Secretary to be able to change the name back  there would need to be a request before the Board that the Board had not acted on.  Indication is that the Board would not stall a request to change the name back  they would simply deny it.,?
5287,Sanders is just as ignorant as Trump about foreign policy concerns. Good thing he's just a non-factor anymore.,?
5288,Hello Alcste   You write:  "You appear to say it's a public duty for all newspapers to fill their pages with murders instead of issues of more complex public interest."  Wow.  No  I did not say that. I did not imply that. I did not remotely hint at that.  You are arguing with material you make up out of thin air.  Indeed  if you scroll up  you will notice that my stand was actually that newspapers SHOULD NOT make their coverage decisions overly based on reader appetites.  Which is to say that my argument about publishing so many murders  the way you made up ("filling their pages")  would be that it would be wrong to so "fill the pages" because it  the massive over-coverage  would mislead the public into adopting an erroneous perception of the reality of the landscape.  And I already made that argument that way  previously  above. Your post argues with material you made up out of thin air  contained nowhere in what I wrote.,?
5289,We already have a disarmament treaty with Russia and Fact Check: false claim.  "So  Clinton could have objected — as could the eight other voting members — but that objection alone wouldn’t have stopped the sale of the stake of Uranium One to Rosatom. “Only the President has the authority to suspend or prohibit a covered transaction ” the federal guidelines say.  "And the president would need to have “credible evidence ” the guidelines say  that the “foreign interest exercising control might take action that threatens to impair the national security.” In 2010  when the deal was finalized  “the geopolitical backdrop was far different from today’s ” the Times notes  as the U.S. wanted to “reset” relations with Russia....  "Committee members include the secretaries of the Treasury  Defense  Homeland Security  Commerce and Energy  the attorney general  and representatives from two White House offices — the United States Trade Representative and the Office of Science and Technology Policy.",?

5293,These questions have been comprehensively answered and the answers have been known for centuries. [1] Yes and [2] Yes. Yes.  The consensus of the genuine sciences (e.g.  anatomy  physiology  immunology) supports the teaching of the Church. Only pseudo-scientific political advocacy denies it.,?
5294,Fire his ass,?
5295,You began with "Welcome to the Alice in Wonderland administration  where logic and common sense get Trumped (pun intended) by mania and paranoia every time."  So you kind of did make the claim.  How's your memory?,?
5296,this is stupidest thing I've ever seen.,?
5297,this will be one of the nice things about auto pilot. Tesla is forcing car makers to add in auto pilots into their cars since Tesla is not only doing it  but way ahead of all others.  In addition  I suspect that tesla model 3/model Y will force the car makers to clean up their dashboards. It is a VERY clean approach  which makes a lot of sense. With other cars  it appears that they simply keep loading more and more buttons on the car. Insane.  But with a single touch screen  the top or the bottom is fixed with a small number of buttons. In particular  it will have HVAC  radio  and selection for the tabbed area.  This has the advantage that HVAC/radio are really heavily used and the only real things that you want 95% of the time. But the tabbed area is great for when you are stopped you can seriously change lots of things about the vehicle. So  these do not get in the way during regular driving.,?
5298,Caldwell is all in.  Taxes be damned.  He's admitted as much that rail and his political career are hand in glove.  Do you really expect him to let this die?  The legislature should stop enabling this man.  The city council won't approve a property tax increase and thus the project will die and Caldwell will be out of office.  Everyone wins.,?

5301,In light of the Trump fiasco in the US  you may want to revise this article! As a Canadian living in the US  I have always been proud of our diversity and the strength it has given us Canadians not only within Canada but abroad. There isn't any perfect country  Canada included  but as someone who travels a lot and has seen a lot  Canada is as close as it can get. I would proudly carry and promote the Canadian flag on my travels any day!,?
5302,I would contact www.bfi.today,?
5303,lol. Politics is much too important to be left to the politicians.,?
5304,Yeah  I just checked realtor.ca.  No houses on the westside under 1.3.  On the east side  one house on West 38th that comes in 1.299  one on East 10th at 1.22  and the Clark Drive listing that was obviously way undervalued to attract a bid runup.  Oh yeah the  1920 tear down shack on a 33X122 lot.  I did say Vancouver  and not Surrey  New West  Langley et al  so I stand by my post.,?
5305,What a load of nonsense!! Grouse at the politicians and bureaucrats who make the rules and enforce the ridiculous legislation. And take off your blinders buddy!,?
5306,Biology itself is a pretty strong safeguard.  By the nature of DNA  most "mistakes" lead to loss of function of the gene in question - much like English or computer code  a mistake is far more likely to generate gibberish than Shakespeare.    If you DO generate a working gene  90% of the time your "mistake" will have no impact. The very rare case where you affect a proteins' function (something requiring a concentrated  deliberate effort and a lot of luck even now)... it's usually a minor change. A sodium transport channel starts leaking potassium  etc. That sort of thing tends to disturb the cell's normal metabolism  and natural selection takes care of it.   We couldn't generate a "grey goo" scenario even if we wanted to  let alone stumble across it accidentally.   Virtually everything they could do  has already been tried by nature at some point and failed the test of evolution.,?

5310,1. "You brought up screening and since it's the first step in immigration it logically follows that it's part of the reason for our success."  The fact that I referred to "screening" as "immigration screening"  hello  yes  that is a good clue that I was saying it is a step in immigration (!). And yes  as I stated clearly  that screening best explains our high level of peaceful harmony  yes  that is what I wrote. So hello  who are you arguing with?  2.  "Why shouldn't the screening process be considered part of the immigration process?" Again  hello? I stated plainly that screening is part of the immigration process  where I called it "immigration screening".  3. No  it is not my "assertion" (roll eyes). It is a FACT that the mechanism for that man BEING in Sweden was a failure of SCREENING. He was not supposed to BE in Sweden  he was a REJECTED refugee applicant. If the screening had WORKED  he would not have BEEN there. His BEING there was NOT a failure of their "integration process".,?

Oregon as of 2014 had reported (30 059) to NICS.  Alaska reported one (1).    New Hampshire two (2)   Oklahoma (25)  Wyoming (4)   "Only about 30 percent of the 4.4 million estimated mental health records in the U.S. over the last two decades can be found in NICS  according to research compiled in 2012 by the National Consortium for Justice Information and Statistics and the National Center for State Courts."  http://gunwars.news21.com/2014/after-hundreds-of-millions-spent-nics-fails-on-dangerous-mentally-ill/,?

5319,Far from me passing judgement on  CR17's morality . What concerns me  is how is it possible for the electorate to trust him when  he is a self-admitted philanderer -if his wife can't trust him who can?The dalliance from the oath of marriage will merely be repeated with lip service to the  oath of office and  done without conscience-undoubtedly this will be spun differently and be denied -yet his form is there for  everyone to see. Would we be foolish to expect the concomitant trust we put into the Office of the Presidency?.,?

5327,Barry Bley: You're as ignorant as the people in this article. A spherical Earth  and global warming are both supported by all available evidence  and both are accepted universally among scientists. It's only anti-science fools that deny these things. It's the same spirit of willful  slovenly ignorance that supports both of these movements of morons.,?
5328,While you raise an interesting point  my question to you is why you would then assume this gives the guy license to cheat everyone else around him of their right to the quiet enjoyment of their own properties and of the tax revenues necessary to support the additional wear and tear his renters will put on the infrastructure.,?
5329,Congratulations.  You win the stupid award for today.,?

5340,Mycellium in tree root networks will be severely impacted in a way we cant really understand.  Yes on the surface we might see these younger trees surviving and large ones dying  but its the networks underneath that hold most of the survivability factors.  The only thing we've changed above ground is drastically suppressing forest fires which  I hope you're ready for this  are needed to keep forests healthy.  Burn away what's it supposed to be there  strong trees survive.  A little less science  a little more observation on how the world works (or used to before we made it work our way).,?

5364,They've largely gotten rid of public baths.  I think it would make a huge difference for the homeless if they just had some place to go where they could keep themselves and their clothes clean.  But unfortunately  we seem to live in a country where the poorest and most desperate are vilified and hated  and those with all the power are given a free pass.,?
5365,NAFTA failed in two respects  though Mexico benefited a lot.  1) Labour laws were not matched to Canada's/US. Mexico was able to get almost slave labour without the worry about 'real unions'. Unions were started by the companies and controlled by the companies. Nice eh?  2) Environmental laws were NOT included. So plants built in Mexico have no where near the same regulations as Canada/US. Check the pollution in Mexico City.  Tighten up just those two will put things a lot closer then they are now.   Softwood lumber. Pretty easy one to fix. Have the lumber companies actually replant all the trees they cut down in BC/AB vs. just clear cut and walk away.,?
5366,Not sure what your point is  Dartguard.  Harper inherited Afghanistan but he voted for it in opposition and even went on US FOX news to wail against Chretien not getting us into Iraq.  And once elected Harper sent soldiers to Iraq.  Harper was a globalist who supported every war going - you say as much yourself.  Ditto his trade globalism. Harper deciding against then for trying to get a security council seat and having to purchase favours from various African dictators should have been beneath even Harper.  But then blaming Ignatieff for Harper's fail was beneath a worm.  And the Maternal Health Care initiate sprinkled billions and served the religious right crowd at home by denying abortion counselling - why did you bring all that mess up again?  Liberals like Trudeau (and the NDP& Greens) support the UN - there is no whining against the UN  going for a seat and then whining about not winning the seat. Yes  the electorate will decide the next election. As ever.,?
5367,A bizarre small brainwashed country with an equally bizarre leader. FFS how are they able to hold the rest of the world hostage for all these years? Am I missing something? Couldn't the US and allies pretty much level the entire country any time they want? Couldn't they unleash such a hellstorm that the country would be wiped out before they knew what hit them?  And if flattening the country isn't an option then why the heck isn't the rest of the world simply cutting them off completely? Nevermind that silly $1 billion in sanctions - cut them off from everything. Zero imports and zero exports. Same goes for the people - no one gets in and no one gets out. Try that and see how quickly North Korea comes to its senses. That countries like Malaysia and China continue to do business with that freakshow of a country is mind boggling.,?
5368,"“[Mr. Mulroney] knows he’s not going to be – none of us – will be around forever ” Mr. MacDonald said. “But he just wants to know that this is going to continue.”" - so why name it after yourself just like Trump.,?
5369,Ronin don't live in the past whether it's true or not. What we are seeing is happening in real time. This presidency is a f----ng mess and that is the bottom line.

One can only weep at the scenario where the SA government only takes action against those who dare to show any ethics or moral fibre ,?

5372,My favorite is when he convinced the American people that they are too stupid to see to their own education  not enterprising enough to build a career  not savvy enough to negotiate a mortgage  unable to prioritize their own needs  simply incapable of getting through the mine field of life without Uncle Sam's guiding hand.  And that  of course  led directly to Donald Trump  the self-styled authoritarian who claimed he can see to your every need by simply declaring that it's solved. Oh  and walls. That Mexico will pay for  sort of  but not really. And all the while making up outlandish and easily disproved lies about his imaginary enemies.  What hath we wrought?,?
5373,If Pres elect Trump is a buffoon (learn to spell) then what is Hillary besides the loser of the new millennium?

I get it ... you're a Trump sycophant  and will write anything to defend him every time he fails.  Good luck with that.  His approval rating is swirling the drain and his administration is being buried under a deepening pile of lawsuits.  He can't be removed from office soon enough.    Trump's a pathological liar who has now shown himself to be a Nazi sympathizer.  He's a piece of garbage.  Thankfully  the courts will protect the country.,?

I have cited NASA research and provided the link so you can go to the data where it shows the past 400 000 years of fluctuation and the massive change that occurred after industrialization. It's your choice not to believe the facts that is the science of carbon dating and ice sheets. It's the wrong choice  but it's yours to have. The data has been observed  repeated  and tested over thousands of years. It is all there. There is no disputing the evidence.,?

5395,Stupid question.,?
5396,I was thinking Army tents on the park strip. That way 3/4 of the Legislature would be ineligible for perdiem,?
5397,So sick of McRino saying ANYTHING to oppose Trump. McCain would support crack cocaine in elementary schools if Trump opposed it  he is a joke. His comments are only to achieve "praise" from the MSNBC crowd  who fall all over themselves to shout the headline "Top Republican Opposes _____________ Breaking With His Party"  Really pathetic guy.  I once heard a story that when his plane was reported back to the ship to have been shot down  many other sailors greeted the news with smiles. I can see why now.....sad old clown.,?
5398,More ignorance than stupidity plus a very leftist indoctrination at their schools with some teaching the climate scam with religious fervor.,?
5399,State rivalry  college atmosphere  terrible reffingnof the game. What did you want them to do? CSU has been chanting "Diirty Hippies  F*ck CU" for over a decade. It will never change so just don't bring your kids to a game that belongs to the students.,?
5400,Oh come on now Charlie. We all know Dump has no real plans other than to enrich himself and his spoiled children. I know he spouts the nonsense you enjoy  but he makes no sense and has the nerve to actually call Hillary the liar when he has spread more lies in the last year than she has in her life. He knows you will lap it up.  Bring back law and order? Crime statistics show lower levels for most crimes and in most areas  so is it paranoia you suffer from or what?,?
5401,This narcissistic man is an a$$hole. Plain and simple. Regrettably  he was allowed to breed.,?
5402,These sick people who write this nonsense are disgusting. They are far more fascinated with the murderer than the victims. I'd rather hear about the lives of the Innocents lost. Their names  their stories. This is what these killers want... Notoriety. Fame. And your giving it to​ him and helping inspire the next. Better his name be stricken from all written records  and stricken from the earth.,?
5403,The so-called "president" is just such a clown and embarrassment.,?
5404,Junior  your ignorance of basic supply and demand is profound. At least you were smart enough to delete your last post of babbling stupidity puking straw.,?
5405,O'Reilly lies so much he's earned his moniker he's most known as  ' O'Lielly'.  As is the usual with you  Dick  you've staked out an untenable position attempting to defend the indefensible.  O'Reilly is a a lying sack of rot.,?
5406,You are pretty stupid for a troll...,?
5407,Songbird McShame is a filthy lying treasonous POS.  The sooner he burns in hell where he belongs  the better off this country - and indeed  the world - will be.  Hopefully his cancer is contagious  and he has cloistered closely with the rest of the Koch-sucking Rove Republican swill.  Go join your buddy Teddy "Swim  bitch!" Kennedy in a warmer climate  Songbird!  Oh Lord  hear my prayer!,?
5408,Nothing but a liar​ and a hypocrite?  Is more . . . he's an idiot and a narcissist.,?
5409,They will launch a nuclear tipped ICBM and after 20 feet  it will hit their beloved Supreme Leader in the arse and end the insanity.,?
5410,Sexual harassment would get me fired for my first offense  and I'm an engineer.  This clown is in a position of power and has repeatedly abused his authority.  Is he in a union?,?
5411,"I am... disappointed that the Globe and Mail editors chose to run this article as written"  Few newspapers fact-check their senior columnists. It does make you wonder how long they'll cling to the long-outdated notion that their pundits' opinions automatically carry weight or influence. (To be fair  senior columnists are often scorned by their harder-working colleagues within the ranks.),?
5412,If you are so concerned you pay for it. We have 1000's of starving veterans living on the street.  Millions of apparatchiks from teachers to secretaries making 100K a year.   Take their cheques - cut them in half - you'll have lots of cash to blow on stupid ideas like this one This bubble of stupid has to end,?
5413,Supreme court decisions don't have anything to do with the radicalization and gun-cult obsession of right-wing gun-nuts. The Supreme Court decision is not the source of your worship of the gun.,?
5414,If you wish to put pressure on FBI to investigate  do it here: https://tips.fbi.gov/  LET'S ALL DO IT,?
5415,I actually like Barbara Del Piano's suggestion for civic statuary that speaks to and elucidates local history. In many great cities  one can spend an afternoon or more visiting statues and public monuments coming away with a greater understanding of place and events. It's good for residents and it's good for visitors. It's even better when these projects can be financed by citizens  groups and foundations with the city providing the locale.,?
5416,The subject was gun homicides  which doesn’t include suicides. We are  after all  discussing people inflicting violence on others. Illinois’ gun murder rate of 5.8 per 100 000 population puts them in a tie for 13th highest. Many of the states with higher rates are the least populous states which tend to skew the numbers somewhat. But the original point still stands... they have very strict gun laws  yet they still have an enormous gun murder problem.,?
5417,Donahue as well as the rest of the team know the team rules. He must have committed a large enough infraction to miss the whole series. Lesson learned. If he intends to go pro he now has a black mark that is looked at. Wish him well in the future.,?
5418,Anyone point a gun at me  I will FIRE immediately.....................,?
5419,Nature is just one big stomach and a google of animals just ate another animal alive!  Why let them live like that?  They are racist  homophobes  bigots  and should be controlled.,?
5420,Western Woods is obviously not a real fan. His ideas are utter nonsense!,?
5421,More stupidity from the city council. Get rid of these hazards and please  no more bike lanes.,?
5422,How dare you!? Are you mansplaining to me? I'll have you know I have a master's degree in Women's studies. You may think you men are going to outnumber & over power womyn like you have always done  but if I were you I'd check my privilege & my stats! There are way more womyn in Alaska than men right now. We also have male allies "white knights" who will also vote for Hillary's vagina as well.,?
5423,Actually  no. Religion is not intended to defend pedophiles  only lunatic pedophiles are the ones attempting to defend themselves.,?
5424,How did that breakdown happen? Oh yes  200 years of slavery  disenfranchisement and oppression. In other words  racism. So you’re wrong. And your insinuation that “black” peoples problems are the result of “black” people is simply ignorant.,?
5425,Pushing the costs upstream to the province or feds is a shell game that taxpayers can only lose.  But don't have much faith in fiscal restraint from Notley or especially Trudeau.,?
5426,What a tragedy!!!     having to pay for your own healthcare!!.... What's next?  Having to feed and house yourself?  What's this world coming to....,?
5427,Ms. Moore is a newspaper columnist  and a damn good one.  The content of Moore's column has nothing to do with whether she's a Democrat or a Republican.  Naysayers' attempt to try and discredit her op-ed need their head examined.  Those that choose to bash Moore instead of addressing Cathy Munoz's public support of two child rapists come across as supporting the rapists.  Attacking the messenger only makes you people look foolish (i.e. Dick Rhyner).,?
5428,"This unfortunate situation arose because the previous Minister of Police (with the concurrence of the cabinet) appointed a dishonest and incompetent person as head of the Hawks." The farcical tragi-comic nightmare rolls along without end.,?
5429,Living where you want to live is not reality in the US.  People live where they can afford to live.  Bush Alaska has too long been coddled by politicians who propagate fantasy economics.  The end will come one day.,?
5430,You are so right because that was how his whole campaign was run: appealing to the stupidest people,?
5431,As was I. For these folks  the right to life begins and ends at birth.  After that? 'Not my problem.'  I shudder to think what these people will do  and who they will blame  when the coal mines aren't re-opened  factories aren't re-started  steel mills aren't blazing once more   and mom and pop stores don't once again line the streets of every town.  It will likely be a bloodbath.  I truly hope that the west coast states (and northeast states) will pursue secession.  This way those who think that a man who mocks a disabled reporter in front of cameras is presidential material  can have their country back  and the rest of us can move on.,?
5432,Except those priests who rape children.  They weren't  and aren't  so much shepherds as wolves preying upon the flock  often with the support of the hierarchy.  But  because they have been given magic powers by the bishop  and those magic powers cannot be removed  they remain priests of the Church even while committing vile acts condemned by all decent humans.,?
5433,YOU ARE THE CARTOONISH BUFFOON EUGENE if you can't remember that the left is still not accepting the results of the 2000 election ...don't you remember the endless drama  court challenges etc the left used to challenge the results ??,?
5434,Happy the moron was thrown off. He was probably liquored up as most of these immature morons are.,?
5435,What kind of mental illness do you  hoodad  have to cause you to continually STALK ME? I have repeatedly asked you to STOP STALKING ME  but you literally follow me around this site to reply to my every post.  You are a typical trump supporter - a CREEPY STALKER with serious mental health issues.  I reiterate: STOP STALKING ME or I will be forced to contact the Alaska State Troopers.,?
5436,............... Trump took the escalator because he is too fat for stairs,?
5437,The old "I've got a bomb." 'joke' gets 'em every time... Idiot!,?
5438,A clueless fool and demagogue like tRump cannot bring it back? Shocker.    Just like his foolish approach to things like trade and automation are likely to fail  too.    Unfortunately  far too few of politicians - especially on the right  where late-stage capitalism is an article of faith - are looking at things systemically or even taking advice of experts that do.    The conspiracy theories and scapegoating that is likely to occur under stupid leadership like Trump as we go through the coming changes are potentially quite dangerous.,?
5439,That's not good enough for the left. They want to change the name to gender neutral transgender gay and lesbian guides.,?
5440,If you want to kill someone  use a car.  The penalties for killing someone  even when at fault  are laughable.,?
5441,99% of all attacks on Jews in Europe  are  by Muslims. . Bataclan had been under threats and attacked by violence for years from  Muslims who hated the Jewish owners of the club.  Kosher stores across France are regularly  ransacked  by Muslim gangs.  Bars  cafes  and restaurants are openly ransacked and patrons attacked by Muslin gangs for sell non halal foods and alcohol  Muslims are the problems.,?
5442,Indeed  the man is an idiot for having risked losing his job for a little nostalgia. Now cue the Trudeau haters to blow this out of proportion.,?
5443,They act like they can just walk on the LIO building lease......  I'm no lawyer  but I hate to think the state can just walk.  There were representations made by state officials as to the authority of the lease when it was signed.  Those same type of representations  or similar at least  are found in the agent-client relationship law.   The only question is  how much due diligence did the LIO building owners have to perform?  If they legally performed enough  then they are due a substantial amount of money. Wouldn't it make more sense to stay put  then to have to pay for the old and the new?   Dear Bill Walker or your legal counsel: Please reply to John/Jane Q Alaskan Citizen.,?
5444,What world do you live in Doug?   No country in the world can thrive when the native population is displaced by mass waves of immigrants.   All governments in Canada are currently running huge deficits just trying to maintain the status quo for Canadians.   Also  why should native born Canadians be forced to compete for jobs  often at a disadvantage  with immigrants?  Family unification?  Immigrants bringing in their chronically ill elderly parents and grandparents forcing them into our already overburden health care system.   Visited an ER lately?    Tried to commute around Toronto lately?  How about buy or rent a house in Toronto?   Make no mistake  Trudeau is only trying to pad the ballot box in his favour.,?
5445,Yeah  these three serial sexual predators have one thing in common; a lot of money to grab p___y and cheat on their wife.,?
5446,Sigh.....  Moron.  Do NOT drink and drive!,?
5447,Don't care tired of the smell of stinking pot filled cars   people in stores stinking of weed   tired of the idiot making concentrates with butane after drying his weed for a weeks every 2-3 months . Wanna use it do it at home don't annoy others with your stuff.,?
5448,You might want to read that article again  the issue isn't whether you've paid into your plan or not  it's whether enough has been paid to support the benefit level. The problem for many public service plans is that actuarial assumptions that were made for funding these plans have proven incorrect (i.e. average length of retirement  internal investment return etc.) and you can't turn back the clock to increase funding.,?
5449,So  when did you think the Statutory Budget Reserve was empty?  As of 1/19/2017 the Leg. Fin. Office's Fiscal Summary indicated that there was $288 million in it.  One of my clients asked his friends  who were expanding throughout the lower 48  why they didn't expand to Alaska?  As your article infers  their response was  "...because Alaska eats its own".  Inconsistent policy  operating  and enforcement environments are not conducive to attracting businesses.  Obviously  Alaska is not considered a good business partner.  The most ludicrous  and unreported  example of this was the MSB's marijuana statute development process. Do your own research.,?
5450,Given that Trump has shown himself to be a narcissistic  lying  sexist  racist bigot  he DESERVES to be attacked. Certainly  no Christian should support him. Do you really believe he gives a damn about abortion?,?
5451,Burn Baby...Burn!!!!,?
5452,Lifeguards are useless.,?
5453,And Anchorage has some pretty darn good police officers.  Seven shootings in seven days; four people gunned down because people can't  control themselves.  That's reflective of what's happening in Dallas.,?
5454,He put his family in this position by committing a crime.,?
5455,Merkel is a stealth commie  arrogant  and traitor.  She deserves the same fate as Hitler  Quisling  Mussolini.,?
5456,Hypocrite writes:  "Thomas. Do you know what "directly" means? Toodaloo!"  --  Yes  actually I do.  Thanks for asking.,?
5457,Must be using the same pollsters that shows Clinton ahead of Trump :),?
5458,The second point I'd make is that not every issue has two equal sides. In this debate  we have one side supported by a lot of sound scientific studies  the Center for Disease Control  and countless physician groups (ADA  AMA  ADHA  AAP  and so on); the other side has cherry picked studies that are generally flawed  not analogous  or in some cases retracted  and the support of nearly no reputable researchers in the applicable field. It's one thing to have a Medical Doctor or someone with a PhD on your side; it's another to have people working in the specific field on your side. If you have a heart valve problem  and your heart doctor and heart surgeon recommend a specific treatment  it's probably a good idea to listen to them instead of going to a podiatrist and asking him what he thinks about heart valve treatments. So when we're trying to figure out how to interpret research  we need to respect the opinions from inside the field differently than those outside the field.,?
5459,Still trying to keep up with Willamalane.,?
5460,Dennis Jameson-  get that sand out of your vagina lol!!!,?
5461,No free ride... These kids have NO IDEA what working for a living is.  All they want is more for not having an education... Get off your butt   get two jobs like the rest of us had too to make ends meet and GROW UP!!!  Minimum wage is for when you are beginning work.... Until you PROVE your worth what they pay you   you get what you get.  It's called walking before crawling.  These kids want all the money first   without any brains second.. And that just isn't the way of the world... Pull your big girl and boy panties up and get to work and stop complaining!,?
5462,Terrorists should be publicly skinned alive.,?
5463,And also how many of the so called Christians are also white racists.,?
5464,Isn't the military kind of separate from the rest of us in south-central?  I mean how many people here even know anyone in the military or has ever seen one off a base?  I guess we get federal dollars as a state for hosting military bases but they aren't really part of the "Alaskan community" they have their own town and seem to just hang out there when they aren't off fighting.,?
5465,I am okay with Howling.  Are you okay with Koelsch?  I would like to see Maafala get more playing time.  But guess what?  Not sure if coach knows who to start and where and that is worrisome at this point of the season.,?
5466,Does anyone know what Dave meant by  "I have been the father of three teenage boys (I say "have been" because two still are  one – *sniff* – no longer)" - is one of his sons 20+ or did one die?,?
5467,notch  i dont know  but im pretty sure they were assholes  totally disconnected with the reality of being poor and probably never met a poor person.,?
5468,It's time to buy stock in companies that make 40' ladders.  The wall idea is just too idiotic to think about.  It'll take decades to seize land from the thousands of private owners who own the land and have no intention of rolling over for Trump.  That will need to happen before the access roads are built to allow materials and workers into the sites.  Trump is an imbecile.,?
5469,Trump cont - Pulled strings/paid to have current wife jump to the head of the line over others who'd been legally waiting for years for citizenship - Sued multiple times for fraud  sexual harassment etc. - Believes it's ok to sexually assault women; enjoys "grabbing them by the pussy" - Believes it's his right to walk into teenage girls dressing rooms unannounced   - Used money donated to his "charity " to pay off legal settlements  buy self portraits and other personal items -LIED about Clinton being "fired" from Watergate (per Snopes.com) - Has consistently LIED about Clinton in order to further his goal of becoming a dictator.  - Proven Pathological liar - Has installed proven white supremacists and Xenophobes as Cabinet members and part of his inner circle - Refuses to disclose income tax returns showing ties to Russia - Using the Presidency for personal financial gain - Refuses to put assists in a blind trust -  Lied about Flynn -  Repeatedly breaks Constitutional Law Cont.,?
5470,No. What she should learn from this is  "Don't do idiotic things like this in public." It ain't what she said  it's what she did. But  feeling invulnerable in her liberal righteous indignation  she thought no one could say her nay. It's the characteristic narcissism of the left-wing agitator. And pathological narcissism is a mental disorder.,?
5471,As I said  you insist rhat you should set other people's priorities. You arrogance knows no bounds.,?
5472,The GET surcharge was created to be the sole dedicated source of local funding for the rail project. Why did the House suddenly forget this and try to cobble together a hodgepodge of funding sources and cuts to the city budget over which they should have no control? As with all funding sources dedicated to one purpose  no government entity  state or city  should have "skin in the game." A dedicated source should stand alone and not affect either the city or state general funds.,?
5473,That's exactly what they did.  They went behind our backs.  And to think  we elected these rats.,?
5474,So what do you think of Page's language then? What's your analysis of her article itself?,?
5475,Is that the test? The impact on "most Catholics"? Or is the proper question: "Does the document present the Church's perennial teaching in a clear and unambiguous manner"? That the faithful are so poorly catechized in the post Vatican II era  and therefore fail to see its defeciencies  has less than nothing to do with AL's heterodoxy.,?
5476,i do not like this crowd of perverts aloha!,?
5477,Sex sells  and politicians have a lot of selling to do.  More power to her.  We're not a society of emasculated borg-beings.,?
5478,Jesus wept.  By all means  let's put up yet another stupid  boorish celebrity playing to the lowest common denominator. The trailer-trash and stone-stupid will be ecstatic.  Our culture and society are doomed anyway.,?
5479,The majority reminds me of Dick Dastardly from the Wacky Races cartoon. He can so easy win the race  but so hell bent on cheating everyone else  He lose the race every time. Drat  Double Drat  Triple Drat!!!,?
5480,This is absurd. It's scary that your fate  whether it's suddenly owing a bunch of money to a scumbag  or worse  can suddenly fall into the hands of 12 idiots.,?
5481,Hey Neil.  There was a hit and run fatality this morning. Aren't you going to preach to all of us about this being another one of those neato vehicle owners and how nobody needs a car????? Oh wait  that doesn't fit your anti-gun agenda.  Hypocrite,?
5482,So you think that Susan Rice (Obama's Liar in Chief) was working for Trump? You must be beyond lost! http://circa.com/circa-now/happening/susan-rice-insists-unmasking-claims-are-absolutely-false http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/5/susan-rice-lies-will-haunt-liberals/,?
5483,Nah  your comment was just kind of silly since the article was about a terrorist attack in London and suspects have not yet been identified. But then  draggin' most of your comments are kind of silly. (I think there were one or two some time ago I actually agreed with though.) (BTW: I'm not a Democrat  Republican  or anything else. I'm a dedicated independent.),?
5484,Thought experiment: Aliens appear and force you to make a choice from two options: 1) The two richest Canadians disappear forever. 2) Or 11 million Canadians disappear forever.  Which do you choose?   According to Canada’s economic system  they are worth the same.,?
5485,Except the buyers have disappeared along with the spike in inventory. Bidding wars are over for the most part and sales are down across the GTA in May. It's going to be a long summer. Credit conditions tightening because of Alt-lenders like Home Capital are having a much bigger impact than what the Province did. Expansion of debt kept housing rising in an environment of stagnant incomes.,?
5486,Gun or not he was hell bent on killing the man who got his woman! Crime of entitlement! Lock his ass up for Life in Seward!,?
5487,Trump knows that so-called "Second Amendment people" tend to think of guns as the solution to just about every problem.   So  what would could a well armed "Second Amendment person" possibly do to help Trump solve his Hillary Clinton problem? A range of possibilities come to mind  with voting being rather low on the list.  Stephen J. Remington,?
5488,Typical HillaryPuppet:  dumbed-down and full of spoon-fed lies.,?
5489,Your "no" is mistaken on both counts. The real reason for not ordaining women is sexism  and your support of this sexism is made clear in your statements.  The one who doesn't know what the facts are is you  not me. But you are happy in your ignorance.,?
5490,so now we want liars and criminals as migrants.why have any laws for immigrants if we forgive liars and free loaders,?
5491,I love Edith and "love to hate" Archie  even if I'm not able to hate the poor rascal.,?

5493,The creation of "a problem" for revenue enhancement.,?
5494,It is being embraced as a necessary part of reality.  Learn to love your warmer self.,?
5495,Because the rich and powerful get away with that kind of crap. Just look at his buddy Bill Clinton. Both him and bill went to the pedophile island of Jeffery Epstein several times. This mutual friend of theirs is a convicted pedophile that got off with minimal time. There was a rape case that was supposed to happen on Dec 16th against Trump and Jeffery but the girl was getting to many death threats and dropped it. So ya that is why the Donald isn't in jail. She was only 13 when she was raped by the two men in 1994. There are a few other cases that the media wont touch but it will all come to light eventually.,?
5496,Gaspingo.,?
5497,That's why it's so suspicious listening to these Trumpers not even mentioning the possibility of The Trump/Russia connections..."I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose voters " President Donald Trump...Looks like he was right...#MAGA,?
5498,Another reason not to vote for these two. Bye bye Lisa and Dan. Do not let the door hit you in the ass.,?

5501,What an asinine and ignorant comment.  The laws of the state indicate that roads are meant for cars AND bicycles.  Try to read them sometime.    What the roads were not meant for is repeat offender drunk drivers.  Or as I like to call them: murderers.,?
5502,Adidas is helping schools with to cost of making changes.,?
5503,I was so impressed with Sessions when President Trump nominated him for AG.. I am very disappointed now.. Sessions needs to grow a pair.. recusal was a weak-dick answer to solving the problem of an out-of-control DOJ  especially a Mueller farce.. Russian collusion  my butt!,?
5504,As part of President Donald Trump’s effort to “drain the swamp” directly into his cabinet  a revolving door coal lobbyist is now poised to take a top position at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.    Trump is expected to appoint Jeff Holmstead to second-in-command at the EPA  where he will be in charge of overseeing the coal companies that he spent the last decade lobbying for.   http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/trump-tap-americas-top-swamp-thing-jeff-holmstead/,?
5505,Your interpretation is total nonsense.  Sounds like you think anyone who wants equal rights for all wants to take away rights from whites.  Do you know any anti-Nazis?,?
5506,Damn right he hasn't got the gonads. Just look at him at world leader meetings. He walks around like a sad puppy. Hasn't got the balls to strike up a conversation with other world leaders. Just waits there hoping someone will ask him something. Completely out of his element and league,?
5507,I prefer his more progressive title- Potato Head. It fits him much better than "Prime Minister Trudeau"  which is nauseating.,?
5508,Well  DC  you got me all wrong.  Iodinate hate the Muslims  I'm terrified of them.  I know that once they are in control  I will be forced to convert or die. And since I'm a born again Christian  I'll have to let them behead me.  And of course the Muslims in Lane Co. behave in a benign manner  they are practicing Taqiyya.  And if you don't know what that means  then you are just simply ignorant of the facts. So  check it out  apology not necessary  just need educating.,?
5509,About 2000 B.C. Egyptians are said to have invented a contraption to move water today called a pump. A common 2017 A.D. application called a sump pump comes on when water is detected and sends the water elsewhere--even up hill if necessary.,?

5516,He sat at my table once and showed the lovely Miss E and me a plan for the South end. We didn't like the plan so much but felt very kindly toward Eran. He was known and will be missed by someone very young who has already suffered great loss.  Spotty little bastards!,?

5518,Unions oppose charter schools as organized and support them only if the teachers are union members.,?
5519,Nope. Crimes should never be erased. Serving your time  does not mean that it never happened. It only means you got caught and had to do time. I would would like to see the homeless participate in the shelters. Seems most of the chronic homeless choose to remain homeless. It's impossible to find any kind of a job when they hang out with other homeless  drinking  smoking and passed out around town. People have to want to change. Most of the homeless seem content to go corner to corner  handout to handout. People have choices. People decide to fight for a better life  but they have to want it. I did.,?
5520,He didn't sell the Russians 20% of our uranium. According to Hillery there is nothing important in those emails Donald asked the Russians to find. No one else can find them.,?
5521,We understand why they THINK they are treated unfairly but are they really? If there were not so many black criminals  then they would not get 'profiled'. 1. With only 13% of the population  blacks commited 52% of homicides between 1980 and 2008  vs 45% for whites even though there are 5x more whites. 2. Between 2011 to 2013  38.5% arrested for murder manslaughter  rape  robbery and aggravated assault were black. That is 3x higher than the black population percentage. Worst yet  black males between 15-34 who are responsible for most of those crimes represent only 3% of the population. 3. Blacks  at 13% of the total population  commit about the same or greater number of crimes as whites  yet whites are TWICE as likely to be killed by police officers.  So  where is the injustice? Seems liked the brothers put the targets on themselves  They can't get work? how many bother to stay in school? how many have a work ethic? how many have clean record? Welcome to the fruits of the Great Society.,?
5522,Hard to take anyone who says the Democrat Party has moved right seriously.  And yes  current fascism resides completely within the alt-left.  You need to 'update' your knowledge of fascism from a left/right prism.  You're dating yourself.,?

5525,Donald believe everyone else is a moron.,?
5526,Guess you missed him mimicking the guy with CP  calling Mexicans criminals and rapists and treating women like they should be lucky enough to get groped by him.,?
5527,Ooh  sparkleboy  everyone is so afraid of you and the baby-in-chief.  Not sure you or Trump could even kick your own ass.  Nobody takes either of you seriously.  You  like Trump are scared little wimps who talk a big story but run to mommy when there's trouble.  Would love to see whiney little bitch Trump say SOB to an NFL players face.  You and your hero Trump are pathetic little babies.,?
5528,Uhhhh... yeah that's one way to look at it?  Pretty sure most people wouldn't treat animals this way either... *smh*,?
5529,As Bill Maher put it: "is this guy just another stupid white man or what?",?
5530,the fbi actually contacted jones to make sure he was okay.  if he were an affiliate of terrorists  would they have done so?,?
5531,Your comment is disgusting.,?
5532,"There is nothing substantial - on Flynn or Trump."  Have you gone to the FBI to report your deep knowledge of these affairs  prof? I'm sure the probes will stop as soon as they hear from you.,?
5533,Is you name really wavemaker or is it fake and are you a hypocrite?,?
5534,If  surveys are correct that at least 20% of priests are gay  then it would follow that rape of boys would only be 20% of the total number of rapes by priests.     But the rape of boys by priests isn't 20%.    It's 80%.   Since the 1950s  80% of the cases of child rape by priests were same sex attacks.  This can only mean that gay priests are far more likely to sexual predators of young people.   Heterosexually oriented priests  as a group  tend to be far less a risk to children.,?
5535,They are Dem's moron.  So is Walker.,?
5536,Nope. Sorry Boeing. Your jets are crap  we can't use them. Get lost.,?

5547,Lots of "elephants-in-the-room" in June  1914  too.  A whole herd of 'em: "...the arms race  nationalism  imperialism  militarism  and the alliance system"  (Wikipedia) Yet  the herd was peaceful enough until one day  a young Serbian revolutionary assassinates an Austrian Archduke and his wife while they visit Sarajevo.  oh  boy.  At the sound of the pistol shot  the whole herd stampedes and civilization endures its first global conflict.  Stuff has to start somewhere.  This is not so much different  Richard.   Not so remarkable.  It's called "The tipping point.",?

5552,Just like the Palestinian Authority  Canada's Liberals are rewarding terrorists...... sick world!,?
5553,Your comment is not just vacuous  it is completely asinine  not to forget  ultimately exceeding cruel and unnecessary. I can only conclude that you are without consciousness.,?
5554,We need to continue our efforts to reduce consumption andmove more quickly to more renewable usage. If oil prices boom again  it hurts all other sectors of oureconomy and the consumer as expenses spiral upwards. Also  higher prices encourage faster depletion of a non-renewable resource and ultimately exponentially increasing prices! We should be aiming to reserve oil usage for areas where we have no alternatives  e.g. Air transport and petrochemicals.,?
5555,BC HAS HAD RENEWABLE ENERGY FOR OVER 2 GENERATIONS.  Maybe stupid people should stop lying.,?
5556,"Couldn't disagree more. The players are being manipulated by leftists (including leftwing media) who couldn't care less about the NFL. Leftist ideology is the root cause of the division and controversy. The players who don't stand for the anthem can kiss my ass."  That MUST be the reason why Dale  Jr. came out in support of the NFL players.,?
5557,What's jarring about the Trump campaign is not just the violent clashes at his campaign events  but the messenger himself. Donald Trump is a billionaire whose message is what? That there aren't more people like him? Or that others should learn how to take advantage of the system like he has done? The problem with Trump's candidacy  compared to the other candidates in both parties  is that he has no core values he will defend as reasons he is running to be the President. He says he is he will negotiate better deals  that all of these politicians are ineffective and corrupt  and he knows "the system" better than anyone else. But isn't the system the problem  by his own admission  while he also benefited from it because his wealth gave him special access to those politicians? Trump's campaign is a mirage of nonsense  a circus fun-house mirror -- it's an illusion within a delusion. But it will all end when he loses in the primary or in the general election. He will never become President.,?
5558,What is it about age 65 that should grant health coverage? Medicare seems fine But providing coverage under the same conditions to a 34 year old woman with 2 kids is "communist"? or "immoral"?  are you just a prisoner of your ignorant rhetoric?,?
5559,Sure. Send them to a leftist liberal US University on the US tax payers dime? I don't think so Jim.   You really are mad!,?
5560,This EPA chief is a disgrace  like the orange guy who appointed him.,?
5561,Well said.  Corruption  collusion and ignorance is what got us here and I totally agree.  Unfortunately naming us Trump supporters as "gullible...easily misled" simpletons is as stupid as the woman who called us "deplorable".  You would have been smarter to leave that part out.,?
5562,If Trump wants the leaks to stop  he should tell fewer lies. Unless the information being "leaked" is classified  the "leakers" are actually whistle blowers.,?
5563,One step further in this article. How the state and the article calculate regresstivity. Especially food. They assume no low income people are getting food subsidies. (Food stamps). And you qualify at a higher income level in Hawaii. And food stamp purchases aren't taxed. Care to take a guess at how many in the lowest income group recieve food assistance. Is 100 percent ruled out? Not here.,?
5564,One of your best  Mr. Haycox.,?
5565,The Underground Railroad was a morally legal response to seriously immoral---and therefore  illegal ---laws permitting slavery.  Where is the analogous illegality of U.S. immigration law?  Doesn't virtually every nation assert the right to have borders  and the accompanying right to enforce them?,?
5566,It was a very heavy handed law that ruined a lot of peoples lives. You were guilty without representation.,?

5569,hey boy  talk big  you say there is corruption  then prove it.  enough of this stupid nonsense  you sound like a 5 year old.  you don't like it  then move  nobody is holding you back.  just get the hell out of here  you really don't belong here  no rednecks.,?

5572,Universal suffrage will get you that.    If only the voting could be limited to the intelligentsia who  in their wisdom  could ensure that everything is done 'politically correctly' and only members of the proper class were permitted to hold office.   Alas  all those Amendments to the Constitution mean that ignorance and all your other derogatory terms don't prevent them from voting.  In fact  Oregon went for motor voting to register those who couldn't care less.,?
5573,This is a great thing for Snohomish county residents. Driving to Seatac takes 1 hour without traffic (or 2+ with traffic.) Another passenger terminal is long overdue!,?

5575,The only sure way to stop this is for the pics to not be taken in the first place.,?
5576,A simple Google search demonstrates just how full of crap you are  Dan.,?
5577,Simple put... Trump has exposed the media for the garbage pail of lies  the cesspool of political  advocacy and the lack of exposure of real scandals during Obamas regime. He was simply impotent. Now  he's just another impotent with a fake news story. And it will fail.,?
5578,I never said  "it's my money". Never.  I said if you ready the Stte Consitution you will find that  it's our money. Collectively. We have hired Board of Directors (Legislators) and a CEO (Gov) to run the State. The people are Shareholders. Don't be a dumb ass by trying to dumb down the fact you were incorrect miss represent what I said.,?

5580,What's the song?  "Fools rush in where angels fear to tread"   Two seasoned  MP's  go where they are not wanted and can do no good.  Fools indeed.  Where will they visit next on a fact finding commission - North Korea?,?

5583,Immigration has always been an issue for us  With each wave of immigration  there was what today we would call  a  'Backlash'. My concern is today  we are not as resilient. Entitlement and me has become too normal.,?

5586,She is a calloused  deceiving and cunning  She was an accomplice to her husband's sexual abuse of women and her treatment of his victims is despicable.,?
5587,AND they think Trump is not mentally competent....REALLY??? LOL....people do not care about what the Trump said....talking about Mika...she has been calling him names for MONTHS....JOE SCARBOROUGH NEEDS TO REMEMBER THERE IS VIDEO AND AUDIO of him being Sexist and misogynist....IF you going to dish it...then you need to be able to TAKE IT MIKA and Little JOE!!  As for this DONNY guy....This is the FIRST i have ever heard of him...was that his reason for the rant...to get noticed...in fact ..I think the Mika and Joe have been talking trash about the President to try and get their ratings out of the dump....it didn't work...,?
5588,Walker sucks.  From his illegal takings of the PFD from Alaska residents  to his quixotic pursuit of an economically impossible gas pipeline  to his penchant for hiring dozens of expensive consultants who get no results  he is almost as bad as Murkowski was.,?
5589,There will be no justice served here. I have seen my wife's truck totaled by someone doing 80 on Lauridsen Blvd. only to get off with driving without license suspended and no restitution to pay for our truck we lost in April 2017  I seen someone I knew steal two truck loads of equipment and only get 3 months in county jail. Today someone stole a dirt bike from my neighbor  it's to where I'm installing a silent alarm and going to shoot to kill to protect what is mine  cameras are useless as there is no justice.,?
5590,This is beyond ridiculous. The County Commissioners and County Administrators are  once again  not doing the jobs they are paid to do. The entire lot of them are a worthless waste of my tax dollars.,?

5596,The Bronfman's made their big $$ when it was prohibited and all smuggled into the US.... Then they bought Dupont stock (but I digress) I agree with others here that once its legal its going to drop in value +++,?
5597,Rail is not an "investment." Never will be. Investments make money  grow in value. . Rail will be a leech on taxpayers forever. Higher and higher subsidies from taxpayers required to pay for rail worker's pensions  medical care  monthly rail O&M costs. . With an in the gutter recoup rate of 30% or less  rail will forever be a huge Nei money pit.,?
5598,If they would also fix shipping rates from online retailers.. that would be great.  Most products ship from China for free.. products from USA sometimes have insane shipping fees... one of them needs to cross an ocean and half the world  the other does not.,?
5599,Hmm. Let's see now. The less educated supported the Conservatives while they were in power while the more educated supported Dion and Ignatieff  Taliban Jack  and angry Tom. Jack and Angry capturing 30% of the vote while the other two captured support from the mid teens to the low 20's. And in a surprising turn around 39.5% of Canadians supported Trudeau who was the least qualified candidate in Canadian history and whose profound intelligence has been well disguised. The moral of Larry's story is either intelligent voters do not vote  or they support appalling/dumb leaders.,?
5600,If Duck U can't maintain  hundreds of millions of dollars worth of buildings and equipment  they don't deserve to have it given to them.  If someone gives you a Lexus absolutely free and you won't  maintain it  you are just a lazy  cheap   slob.,?

5602,Make Trump and the deplorables in the alt-right lives miserable.,?
5603,Uh no! Let's get the cancer cut out and quit wasting blood on a losing  corrupt  useless  ship of FOOLS!,?
5604,Glad you asked. Put all of the State of Alaska's revenue into the Permanent Fund which would raise the fund to around $70 billion. Then pay the state 4% of the fund balance every year to be used for their operating and capital expenses. In years when the fund produces more than 6% in earnings  pay the excess earnings out to the public in the form of a dividend. Under the plan  this year the State would get approximately $2.8 billion. Of course that is short of what they want but it is sustainable into perpetuity. Continuing to build to the Permanent Fund is the Future of Alaska. We accept pain now  for the benefit of a brighter future!,?

5606,No  it doesn't.  Trying to do any kind of psychological analysis on the basis of two sentences  of 14 words total  is simply stupid.  It says far more about YOU than anything else.,?
5607,We need Army Reserves. We do not need MAVNI reserves. MAVNI- Military Accessions Vital to National Interest- How can a National Interest be a reserve? Do we have statistics of how many of these MAVNI reserves were actually called upon for Active Duty?  MAVNIs are hired for the needs on the battlefields around the world  not to drill 2 days a month and work in a bank or a museum for the rest of 28 days of the month.,?
5608,The EPD is a joke.  Victimless crime (Weed? Seriously?!).  What a pathetic excuse of an organization.  What were they protecting?  Who were they serving besides their own ego's?  Pathetic.,?
5609,Correct!  Even Karl Marx was against serfdom which is the system this government imposes on its rural citizens.,?
5610,It should be this way  and stay this way. Sean is right. All most of these reporters are looking for is a "gotcha" moment for video clips. This forces them to actually do their job.,?

5612,Was Frank out of town this weekend?  Was there a Trump rally?,?
5613,The fact is nobody really knows what it is  which is not any more reassuring.,?
5614,Just a suggestion.  We need an 'idiot" button.,?
5615,"There is lots of cleaning up that can be done. Solar power has gone leaps and bounds ..."  etc.  But your examples aren't "cleaning up;" they are ways to emit less. Cleaning up (in mikeak01's post) implies removing CO2 that has been or is being emitted - a dubious prospect for the scale that would be needed (and there are no methods for doing this for the other greenhouse gasses).   Concerning renewable energy and improved efficiency  both are good but their benefits tend to be reduced by the rebound effect (a.k.a. Jevons' Paradox)  and again there is the problem of attaining an adequate scale across all energy uses (power  heat  various transport modes). Also  we are in a time bind (as Yereth's article illustrates) for radically reducing CO2 emissions toward a non-offset zero  and the most immediate and effective means for doing that is for most of us to ratchet down our lifestyle expectations. Your group of suggestions is good (and convenient)  but insufficient.,?
5616,They're both liars  so they have that in common at least.,?
5617,Trudeau has the character to back away from a promise if it does not seem to be desired by the population. Trump just proved that following through on a promise for the sake of it being a promise (in politics). Is rather stupid.,?
5618,The fact is  that flying any heavy is the same EXCEPT for the internal classes. I would not care what heavy I flew as long as it was configured more like Midwest Express used to be; single class with seats similar to a typical first class of current single aisle aircrafts.,?
5619,To all of you idiots comparing Lee with Hitler  etc.  That's ridiculous.  Hitler was evil  killing non combatants and trying to wipe out a people.  I'm not saying that Lee's belief in slavery was right  but it was a different time.  We see it now through a very different lens - the lens of time.  You must realize how people thought at the time is different than now.  You cannot go back and demonize someone based on the morals of today's world.  What did he do after the war?  After Robert E. Lee surrendered  the general was pardoned by Lincoln. Lee moved to Lexington  Virginia  where he became the president of Washington College. It is believed that he accepted this low-profile post  which paid only $1 500 a year  because he felt it unseemly to profit after such a bloody and divisive conflict. In 1865  Lee signed an amnesty oath  asking once again to become a citizen of the US.  He did so as an active encouragement for confederate soldiers to rejoin the US.  Such a horrible  evil man.,?
5620,The left is utterly clueless when it comes to masculinity. They are mostly comprised of homosexuals and atheists who don't even comprehend the values and qualities that REAL MEN have.  The fact is that these commie traitors have an agenda to feminize anything male or masculine and promote and defend every type of crime and sexual perversion known to humanity and for that reason alone  NOTHING that they say or do can ever be trusted. They must be PURGED from the Education System and I would not disagree to an open ended rifle season for hunting leftists everywhere.,?
5621,Don't ever trust Russia completely. Crooked country.,?
5622,Revisionist.  It is well recorded how Republicans were courted and invited to help write ACA  they chose to be the party of "no" and to not participate.  The RNC in particular let it be known that if any member did help then the RNC might be supporting their challenger in the next primary.  They knew that trying to fix the ailing health care was really hard and they wanted to be able to stand on the sidelines and point fingers at any failures in order to gain seats in the following elections.  They did that previously in the first 2 years of Bill Clinton's administration and it worked  so they figured they would do it again.  But Obama had enough votes to pass ACA. . Way too many Republican Senators and Representatives were voted in by their constituents to be obstructionists  so surprise surprise that those same people have no idea how to get anything done now that they are in charge.,?
5623,Just as I said earlier  you're nothing but an irritating troll. Thanks for confirming my low opinion of your motives  such as they are.,?
5624,Maybe " main stream" to the liberty loathing leftist of the N.Y.Times   but to the rest of us  he is a lunatic.,?
5625,I forgot to mention in my earlier post - what's this use of the word 'settler' all about? It's meant to be an insult to non-indigenous people & it's used far too often by journalists & letter writers. Most non natives in Canada were born here & are not 'settlers'. Immigrants & refugees aren't 'settlers' either.,?
5626,We don't have a gun problem. We have a scumbag problem. Those tough gun laws are doing wonders in Chicago.,?
5627,Republicans are damned if they do and damned if they don't.  The old cliché of "be careful what you wish for".  Claiming they would repeal the ACA for seven years they never thought they would have the chance and now they do and are in a world of trouble.  Since whatever they pass will make things worse (assuming they can pass anything) it should lead to a faster process to get us to where we really need to be - single payer.,?
5628,People  never forget  as the Permanent Fund grows our shareholder dividends grow UNLESS people like Charles Wohlforth have their way.  This is so disingenuous AND it does not comply with current law.,?
5629,Jame Clapper  former director of national intelligence said “Absolutely  I can deny it.”   The only thing he can absolute deny is that he did not do it or he did not order it  but that does not mean it did not happen.  This is the same Clapper who admitted making a false statement to Congress in March 2013  when he responded  “No  sir" and "not wittingly” to a question about whether the National Security Agency was collecting “any type of data at all” on millions of Americans when in fact it was.,?
5630,I second Jeremy Sand post...Boo hoo your in need of mental health help badly!,?
5631,No I drive a regular ICE vehicle without the COAL FIRED pollution of your fantasy 'pollution free' EV.  But never fear I don't have to link to lie after lie after lie from an energy advocate who no one respects.  I also do not link to sources that lie about the efficiency of generating energy by adding 'externalities' to one set of options while leaving the same externalities off my 'preferred' source.   I know that nothing will persuade you that your position is delusional and based on a lie.  But other more reasonable people will see the lie for what it is.,?
5632,Actually  the Mayor of San Juan is a more experienced elected official and public servant than Donald J. Trump.   She held her first press conference on the afternoon of the hurricane after herself having accompanied City officials making preliminary assessments of the damage  and specifically addressed the total obliteration of the housing built along the Martin Pena Canal.   She is absolutely right in pointing out that the island is only 100 miles by 35 miles  and that by now  basic relief supplies (water  fuel  food) could and should have reached any point on the island by appropriately sized military helicopter.   She is showing better  smarter leadership than the thin skinned  sociopathic Trump.,?
5633,the GOP had 8 years to come up with plan   DISPLAYS how stupid adn bankrupt their ideology is  !,?
5634,clearly jealous arnt you lefty!!!! thats always the answer with you idiots  tax tax tax tax never work and earn yourself,?
5635,I admit it!  I LOVE talking about how stupid Palin and her supporters are.  YOU?,?
5636,I'm wonder if Obama  like Clinton is wondering why Harvey didn't happen in his eight years so he could act Presidential. A Clinton staffer said this after 9/11. Why couldn't it have happened when Clinton was in office.,?
5637,Trump is Bozo driving the clown car. Actually  he might be a passenger  but a clown nonetheless. I digress. BTW  Frum's autocracy piece isn't original. The people at Truthdig (e.g. Chris Hedges) have been writing about this stuff for quite some time  yet Frum gets the press. Check out Truthdig  Wente to get the real lowdown on the US politics.,?
5638,There's a homeless camp behind the Home Depot on C and Tudor.  I hope it wasn't anyone from that camp.  Too bad they guy didn't just give himself up.  Idiotic to throw any type of dangerous object at anyone let alone a police officer(s) with guns.,?
5639,Please  please can't this horrible women just go away and take her press  and rabid supports with her.  Maybe they might take over Greenland.,?
5640,So Fredrick whatever happened to the rights of the accused. I see he has been accused of a few crimes here but why has he not been investigated further and if that investigation did indeed lead to crimes being/have been committed then prosecution should happen and only afterwards should banishment be sought on the tribal level.,?
5641,I agree. Garbage in  garbage out. The purported 'facts' and statistics are highly suspect and lack legitimacy as well as credibility. They are not the stuff than any reasonable conclusion can be based upon.,?
5642,So you're assuming there's one single payer system that works for everyone?  For example  do you know the difference between the Canadian system and the UK's NHS?  They're rather significant.  Do you want the healthcare providers to be government employees?,?
5643,Suffering is a essential part of life it enables us to connect with our lord and saviour who suffered on our behalf. Suffering should be celebrated. Assisted suicide needs to be treated as a crime  it murders innocent people  and deprives them of a connection to our lord.  We need to take the approach that suffering is natural  beautiful  and a necessary part of life.,?
5644,You are a disgusting person  Alan. Defending OJ and all. But your worst offence is to be the hyper-AIPAC operative that you are. To oppose Keith Ellison???? You are diseased. Wake up and heal yourself.,?
5645,The clown is innocent until proven guilty.  But special counselor Mueller is going to pop the lying pu**y grabber  lol,?
5646,You are 100% incorrect and delusional as well. But I can play along. Trump is Satan and he has fooled you into worshipping Him. Trump embodies Satan  the Great Deceiver. God is really  really upset at you that you've been fooled by Satan and I don't see him calming down and forgiving you or the rest of the Trumpanzees until you pull your heads out of your nether regions and fly right.  Remember Sodom and Gomorrah? You voted for a sexual deviant and pervert who lasts after his own daughter  an adulterer and peeping Tom who likes to walk in unannounced on naked teenage girls in their dressing rooms. And that's not all and you know it. You've turned your face away from God to worship the Golden Calf. You're in for it  Tesa  if you don't change your ways.  Let the rain begin. Better start building that Ark.,?
5647,Only an imbecile would think the sale of marijuana use is going to help schools.  Just the opposite!,?
5648,Oh  well  Ed. If you've never heard him endorse the far right  we can all rest assured that Trump has never done so.    #youcan'tfixstupid,?
5649,More of that progressive civil "dialogue."   It's building bridges.     Anyway  let's not lose sight of why the church is so seemingly unreasonable about divorce.   It has something to do with this Jesus fellow and what he said on the matter.    But perhaps Jesus was a troll.,?
5650,The situation is not even similar.,?
5651,It was legal to smoke before the vote and has been for decades. This woman driver must be a moron not stopping before you enter a street. Basic driving rules. Look both ways especially if you are wasted. 😆. Besides what about the legislative PR person who plowed into pedestrians in parking lot drunk. Didn't look both ways or behind her before backing up. She was leaving Taj-Hawker and had been working drunk. Yet her co-workers didnt see a problem with booze.,?

5656,There is some weird backlash against science happening. There are degrees of this stupidity and flat Earthers are at the far end of the spectrum  but are they really any different than other head in the sand deniers? I don't really think they are.  The scariest part of this is the movements to legitimize their beliefs. Like pushes to teach creationism in schools as an equivalent alternate explanation for things. Flat Earters feel they've been discriminated against  but so what? People don't like to be around morons.,?
5657,I hate this world so much right now.. I am a smoker and I hate it and completely agree with any and all bands aside from my private belonging house and car..This women is an idiot and I think that's being nice..

5661,Denise  the fact that your article discusses climate change using religious connotations should provide you with some indication that "climate change" itself has become part of the new religion for secular progressives  and that science itself has been co-opted to support this new religion.,?

5664,Inept  ineffective  inefficient  indecisive  incompetent  inadequate  impotent.  These probably best describe the Governor  Senate and House.  Now they use the word 'imminent ' instead of the more accurate  'maybe'  'could be'  'might happen'  'who knows' as they prepare to puff out their collective chests and pat each other on the back. Most Alaskans would like to kick them in the butt.  Forrest Gump would say   "Stupid is as stupid does.",?

5670,On average every American family pays a $1 100.00 to $1 800.00 a year subsidy for car travel even if they don't own a car.  Of course most of those who whine about transit etc. have no clue how roads are paid for  it isn't license fees.,?
5671,And to follow up  the reason I put "useful idiot" in quotes is precisely because it is a common phrase that does not only refer to Trump  but rather to a strategy old school communists like Putin have been practicing for many years (i.e. "a useful idiot is a person perceived as a propagandist for a cause the goals of which they are not fully aware of  and who is used cynically by the leaders of the cause." - Wikipedia).  However  that doesn't mean I don't question Trump's intellectual capacity  his ability to have any sense of impulse control (i.e. Twitter feed) and his very judgement.  With that said  it is time for me to get on with my life (to take your advice and "Get over it! Lol).  It's been fun stepping into your echo chamber for a bit: HELLO (hello  hello).  Is there anyone else in here who doesn't share my exact opinion (opinion  opinion)?  No? (no  no).  Perfect (perfect)  Best of luck to ya  to President Trump (see what I did?)  the country and the world.  We'll all need it!,?
5672,You're right of course  but one of the idiots on his staff surely pointed out there is absolutely no "upside" to having recordings.,?
5673,McKenna does not seem to know that financial trade and climate problems are totally separate. Most people are aware that the USA is a major polluter  as is China and India   and possibly Brazil  and maybe Mexico.  Therefore all of these countries should be included in the NAFTA talks ...or..... stop the stupidity.   McKenna is a fool  and is hurting Canada at the negotiating table.   McKenna Freeland and Trudeau seem to be only concerned with voter appeal.   Want to appeal to voters?  Drop the Carbon Tax.,?

I am ashamed that you are the face of our State.,?
5689,This is so remarkably contradictory  considering that twice per day  at the start of each out-going tide  the Ocean Shores wastewater treatment plant discharges its highly toxic untreated effluents into Grays Harbor inlet  whereby it washes into the Pacific  then up the coast and onto all of the beaches. Kids playing  clamming and windsurfing all happen in this toxic filth – year round – and the State Department of Ecology gives them endless Awards of Excellence. Richard Honour  “We know what we have here in Grays Harbor with our active commercial  recreational  and tribal fishing fleets  our beautiful beaches that draw families to explore  play  and relax  and our coastal waters that support thousands of migrating seabirds every year ” said R.D. Grunbaum  Friends of Grays Harbor. “These natural resources and values are simply incompatible with industrial oil shipping.”,?

5697,A one on one audition or job interview or private meeting in a hotel room or other private room where there is an imbalance of power such as teacher -student  or coach - player or director -actor   should be a criminal offence.

5703,"Hound Labs Inc. is announcing Wednesday the development of a new handheld marijuana breath test  analogous to the Breathalyzer device that measures alcohol levels. The company says the product will for the first time allow for detection of the level of THC  the chemical responsible for most of marijuana’s psychological effects  in a person’s system from a breath test.  “The issue was really all-around measurement ” said Hound Labs CEO Mike Lynn. “We need a way to not only test ‘yes’ or ‘no’ for the presence of marijuana  but to actually measure and correlate THC levels with impairment  like we have done for alcohol.”  Other companies have touted the ability to detect marijuana through the breath in products currently in testing  but Mr. Lynn says his product will be the first to give precise measurements in picograms — measurements of one trillionth of a gram — that can be used to determine a person’s current level of intoxication from smoking marijuana."

5706,The heavily populated old world countries already had plenty of serfs  peasants  indentured labourers  etc. to work the fields.  The colonists needed to import manpower into the new American colonies because they lacked manpower to exploit the new plantations  cotton  tobacco  etc. With the invention of the cotton jenny and manufacturing  the demand for raw materials for British factories went through the roof  and so did the demand for cheap labour to produce them.  Now you are the one switching from "the evils of discrimination" to "the evils of slavery"  after focusing on the discrimination aspect  and after claiming you were not talking about morality.  Who's defending exploitation by ruing classes  whether of serfs  indentured labourers  slaves  etc.? Not me. It existed everywhere  and still does  although a lot of the worse abuses have been eradicated from a large swath of the world today  thanks to the revolutionary ideas about the "rights of Man" developed by the West.,?

5708,Careful about calling out dramatic red lines in the newspaper. It's obvious that Liberals gave their position to the Globe for publicity.    The commentators seem to be very hard line on "lets give it to the Americans"  but we need to remember that Canadians need access to the American economy and consumer - Period.    Trudeau's popularity would rise initially with standing up to the Americans but would take a huge dive if people started losing jobs  companies started moving south etc.. The Americans can afford a year of economic uncertainty with their Canadian Trade Arrangement  Canadians cannot.,?

Another article mentions that camera suppliers can sell the cameras at cost  and clean up on data storage fees. (The old Gillette model.) We're talking Petabytes of data.  Then we have to talk about retention periods. Does DPD keep that file for 30 or 90 days? A year? That's a serious budget hit.

5761,What is even sadder is teachers who are tenure and have multiple years in the district who are good teachers are being let go. They need to be retained they've already started their career they have years of teaching and I'm not close to being retired and much to still offer but because of the state's lack of budget they're being let go. I think instead of a state tax number one government officials should have their story have to and we should not be paying for them to travel to Juneau and paying a  Perdiem. If they're going to do anything it should be a head tax where the head of household pays $50 or $100 per every person in their family out of their first paycheck of the year  this includes welfare recipients and lazy people who don't do anything to contribute to society but expect society to pay for everything for them. If you counted the number of people in the state of Alaska the amount of money with no exceptions being given to anyone.,?

Like I said  we're all human...but a talking head does not command the same "stature" or "status" as a national politician  especially "President".

5788,This is stupid.  Existing STEM graduates can't find jobs in Canada so why train more people for jobs that don't exist?    These girls will graduate with their heads full of giddy dreams only to smack headfirst into the reality of few jobs  TFWs taking over  low pay  no benefits and unstable contract work.    They'll only end up going to the US.,?

5790,By that argument any bigotry is sanctioned. This isn't about freedom of religion  it never has been  It is about the supremacy of one religion and one particular brand of that religion. Nor is this a free speech issue. You can say anything you want  but you have to have also take responsibility for the consequences and not whine about being victimized. These folks have more in common with the ayatollahs in Iran than they do with the American founding fathers.,?

5806,Blind quote by Frazier  "America's leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred  bigotry and group supremacy  which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal "   REALLY??  Thats exactly what Trump did you bigot.  He denounced all the hate groups  yours included.  I guess if you cover your ears and close your eyes it makes it not so. Who do you think you are to believe we are all THAT stupid.  You sir  Mr. Frazier are a blind racist who would do well to look at the big picture.  No reality  and no respect.  Unity takes effort from all sides.  You want a dictatorship.,?
5807,evidence of democrats stomping their feet or bawling? the procedures for recount have been followed  methodically and the rationales presented calmly and soberly  versus the fact that trump  in an impulsive outburst  has claimed he "really won" the popular vote   while providing zero credible  documented evidence to support the claim...,?
5808,Agree that Bannon's pushing to get out of the Paris Accord was a terrible move.  "Climate Change" is the closest thing there is to a world religion.  Even the DPRK has signed on to the Paris Accord  not of course  that it really affects them in any material way.  Giving notice to withdraw from the Paris Accord has been a complete disaster with respect to the allies we desperately need during this extremely perilous time.  The U.K.  France  and Germany are good examples of this.  Trump should have simply smiled and pursued the tact that Xi & Modi have -- i.e.  tacit agreement but still acting in their nation's best interest.  Since Bannon helped to orchestrate Trump's upset win he's certainly not an "idiot" with respect to grass roots politics.  He might well be deemed an "idiot" for the disastrous effect his climate change stance has had on our geo-political security.  Do you have any specific examples which prove that Bannon is a "racist?"  Thanks.,?

5813,I don't obey any gun laws  and I think that would make me typical of a large number of gun owners. Implementing any laws for anything and expecting them have any result in the US is sort of like trying to herd cats. So many people don't care that it is impossible to arrest them all  regardless of the law and the situation. That would apply to the millions of kids murdered by there own parents  folks that cross the border illegally and trying to get someone in love with his rifle to stop worshiping tools.,?
5814,What a bunch of liars or amateurs.  Trump's team is as clownish as he is.  Trump is playing with fire and he ought to stop it.,?
5815,Fools gold. Weed is for fools. Addictive as methamphetamine  the addicts smoke all day and night still think they are not hooked. Hilarious stuff if you like watching paint dry and living in a dream.... - The truth about growing is it is always better when grown outdoors. Indoors is just trying to trick the plants with artificial lights. There is no reason to grow indoors. In fact it is very wasteful of electricity  not green at all. - 1) Cannabis is always better outdoors 2) Cannabis does not need to be fresh  it will stay fresh for months and years 3) You don't want to smoke cannabis  if you do then you want to vape pure shatter  pollen. It is the plant material that causes health problem with smoking. In the future nobody will smoke anything but the pure stuff. 4) All Cannabis can be grown outdoors in the summer in Canada. Canada has millions of hectares of farm land. We have so much cheap land that we export pulses to India  that's how cheap it is. Think about it.,?

5825,Crossing the US border is really like entering a negative lottery. Most of the time  you'll be okay. However  if your number comes up  they can give you a very hard time  or even ruin your life on a whim. This applies especially to anyone who wasn't born in Canada  but can affect anyone  really. Among all the people I know  the word is don't cross that border unless you absolutely have to. It simply isn't worth the risk. You're putting yourself in a situation where you have no recourse and no rights at all  so you must weigh the risk of being treated badly   against the benefit of whatever it is you were planning to do.,?

5841,That is one of the stupidest ideas I have ever heard of and it figures it is Toronto and its NDP City Counsel.

5843,"After the federal government introduced Bill C-56 in late June that would restrict how long inmates can be placed in solitary confinement..."  That statement is incorrect. Bill C-56 does NOT restrict how long a prisoner may be kept in solitary confinement. This includes younger offenders and prisoners with mental health issues. Bill C-56 simply requires that the warden who sends the prisoner to solitary confinement shall file a report on the matter after 15 days. After that  there's no limit to the amount of time a prisoner may be kept in isolation.   You can see the facts for yourself at the following link:  http://www.parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/42-1/bill/C-56/first-reading,?
5844,Garrans  the blast effects  radiation  lack of basic necessities  and potential total anarchy will be way worse than predicted by any lame public official or agency.  Were you aware that Russia is working on completing and some day positioning smaller stealthy drone submarines with a 50+ megaton warhead to lie dormant off shore anywhere until detonated  which would create an immense tsunami at point blank range  plus wipe out military facilities and Honolulu completely  if no the whole island of Oahu  all with zero warning time.  Now  that is truly the ultimate nuclear terror weapon (other than a cobalt doomsday type device) and someday maybe even the NKs will have developed their own. This sure makes a missile attack seem like the lesser of two evils  if that is even possible.,?
5845,If Trump truly has nothing to hide then why is he constantly trying to influence an investigation. Let the investigation run it's course and let Mueller do his job. Quite obvious that DT has something to fear from being investigated.,?
5846,Unfortunately Herbert got hurt on his TD run but it's been the same type of offense now for several years. It's just part of the deal  our QB has to run the ball to keep the D honest or our run game would be total crap. You can't put the blame on Coach T for Her set getting hurt that's just a bunch of garbage. Sounds like this reporter is already trying to get WT fired. Unreal. Injuries are part of the game and yes they suck. This is why a few of the other QBs should've stuck it out. Enter the game being the 3rd stringer and the next week you're the starter. Lol,?

5867,I don't know the ins and outs of this situation on Poland  but one thing did jump out at me  which I would vehemently oppose if I lived there too (and makes a bit more sense of Brexit): that the EU has any right or should have any right to judge and actually punish a nation state over what it does with its judicial and political system.  This is why more people are becoming Euro-sceptics.  The economic union is a great idea; but unelected bureaucrats telling what elected governments are to do is another story.,?

5875,I think vacation rentals are beneficial to local families striving to own property and make ends meet. Tuition  mortgage  taxes  medical bills  cars  food and supplies is where the revenue from vacation rentals goes. Why is this a problem in resort zoned Waikiki buildings? It shouldn't be. It gives visitors what they want: a kitchen  parking  enough room for the kids. In residential Kailua and other places yes thrre are legitimate concerns  but please do not forget that most people are in this business more out of necessity than being scammers. Hotels have their place. Vacation rentals have their place. Both types of lodging should be able to coexist and compete to give off the most benefit to the community and visitors. A bigger problem seems to be that our government officilals seem to be in the back pockets of developers these days and are allowing them to destroy what beauty and serenity are left on this island without much concern for people in need of housing and more.,?
5876,By the way does the alcohol control board require people selling booze to get it tested? Is booze ever tested? Is there a big problem with people buying bad booze in retail stores? No to all of the above. Don't they realize the pot underground self regulates the quality of it's plants because they are proud of their product and would sell very little if it was no good which would be pointless since no one would want it. Consumers are not stupid. Duh...,?

5879,Very well thank you.  They actually turned out quite well. Both a employed contributing members of society and have never been on welfare other than student aide which they paid back.  My 39 year old son still says yes maam and yes sir when speaking to people older than himself. He's married to a Souix  had two kids with her  temporarily divorced her and remarried taking her 2 year old daughter in and raising her as his own.  My 37 year old daughter served in the military 6 years and now is an ATC with FAA. She's married and has 4 kids she's homeschooling.   So I guess what ever I and my wife did  it worked.  A little secret for you though.  There were always consequences for their actions. They knew what they were allowed to do and what happened if they didn't do it. Oh and consequences are never a negative thing. Learning good things happen when you do right is just as good as learning bad things happen when you do wrong.  That;s part of this society's problem. Lack of consequences.,?

And how the Mexican cartels / Mexican Government reap millions exploiting those humans. Funny that...,?
5885,The fact that so few Americans owned slaves just means that the rich whites  as usual  used the draft and divide and conquer strategy to get poor white Southerners to fight their Secessionist battle for them. Slave owners were able to buy their way out of service. Not poor white Southerners. Over and over in this country  white supremacy was trotted out to get poor white Americans to accept crumbs rather than unite with their fellow black Americans. Poor white Americans were used to chase escaped slaves they themselves could never afford. Poor white Americans were used to segregate and terrorize freedmen who only wanted liberty. Poor white Americans were used to enforce Jim Crow the 20th century.   The more things change  the more they stay the same.   The stats you cited provide even more reason to toss the racist divisive Confederacy into history's trash bin. Let's stop celebrating poor whites being duped to fight for slavery.   Fulfill the ideals of Reconstruction  at long last.,?
5886,My anonymous source says you're an idiot.,?
5887,I guess another thing  all 19 hijackers on 9/11 were middle eastern looking muslims  so why do white children and a 90 year old Japanese lady get frisked in her wheel chair? Why does a kid with a knife given to him by his grand dad who fought on the braches of Normandy have to surrender that knife in order to go on holiday? You see  it's the lack of common sense at TSA which reflects the madness in Washington that drives us mad. You are essentially ignorance 'boots on the ground'.,?

5890,The NDP right now don't seem to have the political savvy to win elections whoever they choose as leader.  The way Justin Trudeau outsmarted them in the last election is evidence of that.,?
5891,This could have been written by my siblings or I. I controlled my father's access to my children and never ever left him alone with them. I listened to that inner voice  gut feeling. It made it easier that we lived in another city and that my mom had passed before my kids were born. She had enabled my dad and covered up for him when he abused my siblings and I  but it would no doubt have been more difficult to deal with. My only regret is that keeping my dad at arm's length was by passive manoeuvres all those years and that it took me until recent years to take back my power  confront him and say farewell for good.   Listen to your gut and don't question your maternal instinct to protect your kids and raise them in a healthier family dynamic than you had ,?
5892,Has there been a recorded case of a drone collision resulting in a downed helicopter or aircraft?,?
5893,TDW   In many cities  states and countries there will soon be no market for ICE powered cars and trucks. The markets where ICE powered cars will be banned include India  China  France  England  Scotland and the Netherlands. Even before these bans the steady increase in EV sales is evident. EVs are the future. If you don't believe me you might choose to believe GM  Ford  BMW  Daimler  Nissan  Renault  BYD  Volvo or any of the other vehicle manufacturers who have clearly stated that they are transitioning their manufacturing to be ready for the global move towards electrification.,?
5894,This entire piece is a lie. Nothing has been debunked and nothing is exculpatory  as long as you are not a complete idiot. What the DNC/ Clinton campaign paid for was research. They do not need to pay anyone to just make stuff up  like the moron who wrote this "article" seems to think. They paid an intelligence analyst to look into Trump and what they found was treason and corruption.,?

5900,I think a little more research in 'actual' history might surprise you. Rome (even while Christianity was the official religion of Rome)  fell  because of a long line of incestuous idiots dictating orders that had no connection to "mocking the lord." Sheesh man  the word 'progress' has only been politically used for the last 500 years  and in the face of superstitious religious extremism who's only purpose is to dictate intolerance and pep talk the superstitiously gullible into spreading the most impacting lie on human history.,?
5901,Andrew Scheer appears to be a good compromise.    Like Bernier or O'Leary  he will lower taxes  but his fiscal platform appears to be more measured and costed.  He can appeal to social conservatives without letting them run the show.  He has more MP support than any other candidate  though it's hard to say if this means he has the most member support. His positive tone and youth may attract some centrist and younger voters than the CPC would need in order to win key suburban swing ridings in 2019.  Also bilingual.     It would be nice if the G&M spent some time profiling some of the more promising candidates like this  rather than painting the whole party with a broad negative brush because they don't like three of the candidates.    Pretty much all of the candidates opposed M103 and oppose a carbon tax  so let's spend some time learning about differentiating factors between the candidates.,?

Cis hetero love  life  work  sex  murderers  rapists  drug pushers  ext.* uses lgbt bodies as sex toys  trys to rape cure lgbt people. Cuckold racism  bdsm. Rape kinks. Pedo kinks slave kinks. Ffs. Religion is know for protecting pedophiles while saying lgbt people should burn. If yall don't do any of those things  yall willingly ignore your own who do do it. While looking for just 1 thing to demonize us.* looks at any tragedy in human history. Cis hetero is always the reason why. *  Now tell me  who's the deviant?,?

I viewed the video by a concert goer during the shootings and it's clear the shooter was reloading his weapon twice to inflict this massacre.  To appease the gun lovers in the U.S. I'll allow them their handguns and rifles for hunting and self protection  but automatic weapons make zero sense. This tragedy need not have occurred and my thoughts and prayers go out to the victims involved.  Like I mention earlier  a senseless  tragic event. When will people realize the insanity of mass shootings? It can stop. If we want.,?

5919,These stories and Crimes are committed  almost weekly now.   SEX  PROSTITUTION   DRUGS  Donahue also pleaded guilty to a charge of felony promoting prostitution in 2012.    In March 2016  she was arrested for driving under the influence of intoxicants after police say she admitted to smoking “four bowls” of marijuana.   Isn't  she  just a little SEX Kitten?????????  As always its the children who are the VICTIMS.  I feel extremely SORRY for them.    Lock this Trash up for a few years.............,?
5920,Dumb,?
5921,Hate to say it  but watch and see how the DA's office will plead it all away now to time served. Anchorage wake up the city is going to s**t. The DA's office and the Mayor are to blame. Pull your heads out of the freak'n sand.,?
5922,I respect your opinions based on your posts I've read. That the R-G's list has actually changed your mind is significant to me. So I would modify my original post by saying that either they print the pros and cons for all candidates or they print none. That would seem to be the most unbiased approach. Your last sentence seems to support my position that a newspaper is not just a citizen of its community.,?
5923,Let us stick to the subject of Trump not respecting many humans  one second they are his "best" pals  ( I have so many wonderful friends he says non-stop) and the next second Trump has made up a silly name for them and puts it on twitter since he appears to have a lot of time for nonsense. So what is the deal that Puerto Rico is in crisis and Trump is taking on the entire NFL. No doubt this subject is more important to him then suffering and dying  American citizens. But I will give Trump the benefit of the doubt  maybe his aides forgot to tell him Puerto Rico belongs to the US and not Cuba.,?
5924,And this has to do with Dorothy Stang how?,?

5933,Cosby gives Blacks a bad name  no? After reading so many techniques he used with his star celebrity status  he is the BEST rapist I have ever heard of. Wonder if someone will write a crime story about him when more facts come out in the trial. It's going to be a challenger to the OJ Simpson trial. Please do hurry up and start it. I don't want him or I to die of old age too soon. It's going to be a fascinating trial. What I'm curious about are these questions. Were these women given monetary gifts afterwards? Were they looking forward to an adventure of being "raped" by a black man  especially a Hollywood celebrity? But were angry that they fell asleep and missed the fun? Why did they continue to stay if they realized they entered a room full of only well-dressed black men? Were these victims angry because they gave sex thinking they were going to get glamour or well-paying jobs? Prepare yourselves. He may just get ACQUITTED.,?
5934,How is he not also facing a jail term?  This is outrageous!  The penalties for individuals in positions of power and authority (especially in the government) should be far more severe to deter these kind of activities in the future.,?

5941,Have you read the agreement? It reads like a children's book about rainbows and unicorns. They can't cancel Kinder Morgan  the Federal Government can use whatever means necessary to get it built - Canada is a nation governed by the rule of law and our Constitution is stronger than the "social license" required by welfare recipients who protest for a living. The document is filled with broad idealist puffery that bear the hallmark of Green party naivety. They throw around "climate change" like it's a tangible monster (manbearpig?) when in reality it's an excuse to increase taxes. Imagine if Mayor Moonbeam took over control of the entire province and that's what you get with a Green/NDP coalition - it's a ridiculous clown show and an embarrassment for Canada.,?

5950,with all due respect  you are not entirely correct  Texas does not have an income tax and NY has to run adds on TV to try and bring people back to the state because they are leaving in droves due to the high taxes they have to pay.   also  what specific programs are mandated in the constitution to be provided? other than education?   I would have to agree with Bob  the state needs to show some meaningful cuts before taking money from the people. if they impose an income tax  what do you think me and my family will have to do? that's right  we will have to make some meaningful cuts in our budget  we can't just go out to our employers and demand more money to balance our budgets. the state must also put a cap on their spending  we cannot continue to spend more each year and really have nothing more to show for it. the people should be able to vote on whether they can increase their budget  after all  it will be us that has to come up with the money.,?

5954,If you don't live stream to the Mainland  the Professional who compile football rankings  choose bowl teams  and write stories  won't be able to give UH high rankings and even vote them into the top 25. It'll also hurt recruiting as HS players won't be able to watch and follow UH on the Mainland. Not a very good decision by our AD.,?
5955,It is unlikely that every politician subscribes to every aspect of their party's platform   and as is everyone's right will hold views that may be counter to them. However these vies are largely kept off the table  depending on the desires of the party. Harder can as they say  walk and chew gum at the same time. Holding a pro-life view doesn't translate into forcing the committee to subscribe to her views. If anything she would likely to be even more carefull considering the controversy   to make sure she walked a neutral line. The Liberals didn't need to do this  but by doing so continue to poke holes in their openness  diversity  and freedom card that they play often. One is reminded of a great line by Henry Ford when asked about the colours he was producing in the new age of the car. Ford replied you can have any colour you want   as long as it is black. With the Liberals  freedom is what we decide it is.,?
5956,Absolutely true Rick - you have to buy a membership into the Conservative Party.  Liberal Party membership is free - and worth every penny.,?

5966,Hint: If you want "reasonable protection against gun violence " whatever that means  trying to disarm the good guys won't help. And if you're going to accuse someone of racism you'd better have some serious proof. Otherwise you look like you're just on a political witch hunt.,?

It's pathetic really how poorly educated the vast majority of Alaskans are  but hey let's make education suffer even more shall we?,?
5972,you are a misogynist,?
5973,stop making excuse for your infantile and stupid behavior.  there are ways to express your displeasure but showing your finger is not one of these ways.  you have disrespected the process and brought shame to the Hawaii delegation and people.   you owe the people of Hawaii an apology and to the DNC.  If you refuse to apologize then you should resign your position with the Hawaii democratic party.  there is no bravery involved just plain stupidity.   you are stooping low like trump is doing in his immature behavior when people disagree with him.   maybe you should join the repubs  you should feel at home with them.  dems do not tolerate stupidity.   no fd  she does not love Hawaii  she lovers herself  if she did she would not have done what she did to bring shame to us.,?
5974,What fool said "Elections have consequences"???,?

5976,The Russians can "play nice" by withdrawing their troops from eastern Ukraine and ending their illegal occupation of Crimea. Paying reparations for the war damage they did would also help. Asking them to apologize for being the Huns of the 21st century is probably asking for too much.,?
5977,If the WWF had its way  we'd all be living the way our ancestors did in the mid-19th century. That organization is more than just a nuisance: it has become a threat to  our way of life.,?

5982,Who lost in America? The Democrats. When will this sink into their heads. Pathetic.,?
5983,PERA's rate of investment return has exceeded the assumed rate in 5 of the last 8 years since 2008. And PERA has done better than most pension funds. Of course  in 2008 the fund's return was negative 26 percent  because the stock market lost 39 percent. Lots of 401(k)s got decimated in 2008. So it would be wrong to say PERA has invested poorly. The main reason PERA is proposing these tough changes now is that it has decided to lower the assumed rate of investment return for future years  and because retirees are projected to live longer than previously expected. I am glad to see a reduction in the COLA as part of the proposed solution. The PERA Board's proposal shows they are willing individually (as employees or retirees)to share in the sacrifice to make PERA better funded.,?
5984,Dumb comment. There has been only praise for the way Trudeau is handling NAFTA and trump.  Zeus  even trump has been positive on that. Of course  that excepts you and the idjit cpc MPs sent down to bad-mouth Canada recently.,?
5985,I'm as conservative as they come. But I don't want to hear about abortion or gay marriage or sex education or bathrooms.   That ship has sailed.  Stop wasting our time with distractions. I'm no fan of any of the Clintonistas  but James Carville was right. It's the economy  stupid.,?
5986,So the conservatives give us the image we need to see.  a party with no interest in expanding beyond it's white racist base.  They have pretended to be "inclusive" but given a chance to show what they really admire you get to see where they come from and at are going.  The party is shrinking to a small band of hateful morons based in Alberta and driven by the uneducated banjo pickers in the rural areas of Canada.  Please continue to drive the wedge farther and tighter so the liberals can reap the rewards of all the good people you alienate!  Liberal rule for at least  a century!,?
5987,That would be good. I wouldn't mind if my own properties declined in value. But it would create some investment opportunities too.,?
5988,The rude  boorish cartoon character comes into office with just 40% approval rating to begin his administration. Like so many things about him this is unprecedentedly low as in never have we seen a man sworn into office whose own voters don't like him even before he reneges on all his campaign promises. Bush Jr. left office with an approval of 27% but we will see that record shattered before trump is done film flamming and Making America Hate Again. If ya didn't like Jr. you're really not going to like what trumps cadre has in mind for the nation.,?
5989,Are you retarded? Two adults having consensual sex and being filmed isn't the same as someone filming a child being abused or sexually molested  neither does it even remotely pertain to rape.   Rapists get off on all sorts of perversions but I highly doubt consensual sex between two adults is one of them.  You have some serious issues lady. (And I use the term lady loosely),?
5990,What it is is a bunch of racist villagers who think they own everything including the wildlife. They have tried every trick to promote their racist agenda. Its pathetic.,?
5991,Here's a fun game; pick the word that doesn't belong.  Hint  rhymes with moron. Coherent Logical Plan Trump,?
5992,The last I heard  there was no mechanism for the Finance Minister to decline a salary. How much does Morneau give to charity or other worthwhile causes anyway. Having a pile of money coming in isn't in itself immoral is it? I read all the time from right wingers on these boards that rich people are rich because they deserve it and how effort  risk and ingenuity should be rewarded but suddenly if it is a non-Conservative who has the money  it's all just so wrong!,?
5993,And here I thought Liberia was our favoured African country! The UN has their sucker and it's us.  "Make Canada Nice Again".,?
5994,Your poetry sucks  write for Breitbart.,?
5995,Brown and Courtney are being honest and realistic. PERS has been "reformed" (benefits reduced) over 20 times since 1995. The system no longer resembles what it was before. The last effort at "reform" was dishonest and illegal and made the payments issue even worse. It was a diversion. We don't need any more of that. The Court is not going to approve of unilateral retroactive reneging on contracts. And States have no legal path to bankruptcy. That would be a disastrous action with long-lasting damage in any case. Oregon must find a way to bring its high school graduation rate out of the national basement. It needs a way to fund the Oregon Health Plan  which has changed many lives for the better. It badly needs a better revenue system than the rickety and unstable one it has now. Measure 97 is the only hope for the next two years. It is not perfect  but it is amendable. Let's set the process in motion. Pass it. Revise it as needed. Move forward  not backward.,?
5996,You Liberals sure are CLUELESS.  It was a Temporary Ban to get those 6 countries better vetting.  COMMON SENSE is gone from the looney left.  All they seem to want is to destroy Mr. Trump and our country.  So selfish !   This has NOTING to do with Immigrants it is for PUBLIC SAFETY....wake up SHEEP I'm so SICK of the loser left who can't handle that Hilary lost.  Time to GET OVER IT and Work together to make our country better.  WHY do you fools want to destroy Trump and in turn destroy the USA ???  idiots,?
5997,Yes putting your company in bankruptcy and not paying all smaller vendors so they also default clearly shows how Trump "gets it". He gets it - but his definition of that word is not to give a crap about anyone but himself. His mouth talks but his action speaks......,?
5998,Here you go  from Forbes 7/2016 ...  Economists at the University of Pennsylvania  also using actual pre-ACA individual market data  estimated that the total expected price of individual market coverage (premiums plus out-of-pocket payments) increased by 14% to 28% as a result of the ACA. According to their findings  “the pre-ACA average premium was lower than the lowest silver plan premium.” Penn’s economists also estimated that plans in the individual market before the ACA had similar actuarial value to silver plans  not an average actuarial value that was 10 percentage points less (and 17% less) than assumed by Adler and Ginsburg. Importantly  all of these studies compare gross premiums before and after the ACA without accounting for subsidies that lowered ACA plan premium. God bless you! Have a great weekend!,?

6004,Oh you crazy "lefties"!  How could anyone think Trump was not "reasonable" when he Tweets such wisdom as the following:  "How low has President Obama gone to tapp [sic] my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!"  Just watch the deplorables explain this one.,?
6005,WTF? As in WTF was that article about? Wow.,?
6006,Cruz is a feckless worm.  Even though Hillary would be an economic disaster for Alaska I still couldn't have voted for Cruz if he had gotten the nomination.  Probably would have written in donald duck.  Cruz campaign started the personal business by running a nude pic of melania trump from an old GQ mag.  I guess he didn't like it when Trump put out a pic of heidi and melania the two side by side.  Hopefully this petty little act will be the end of Cruz.  He can go back to his bible routine.,?
6007,Trump got five deferments for bones spurs -- which disappeared the moment Congress adopted an all-volunteer army. But feel free to keep up your hero worship.,?

6016,You should give all your money to "the greater fool.",?
6017,Funny isn't it. The more rational Liberals are showing their real fears.  What kind of monster are they about to create? Medical experts have warned them yet they obsessively drive head on at high speed into a massive destructive wall thanks to the will of their stupid leader. Everyone knows there's far more reasons to discourage Canada's use of pot than there are to encourage an even greater use of the drug - except for him.   So go ahead  try and create a real tough law to feel better about yourselves.  Will you stop pot and alcohol from being used together? Absolutely not. Your own leader openly admitted doing so illegally with friends after dinner when he was an MP. We also know that lots of people will drive on both drugs as a two-drug cocktail lowers judgement even more.  With kids and pot  guess what? Your new law will put so much pot out there it'll be far easier for all kinds of young children to have their brains permanently modified by the drug by the time one's 20 yrs. old.,?

6024,Here's my solution to the problem:  STOP PLAYING THE NATIONAL ANTHEM AT NFL GAMES.  All sporting events  actually.  It's not a law  and in fact  it's not even a good setting for the anthem  with people buying beer  toileting  and still trying to find their seats.  Plus  this nation is not Nazi Germany...we do not need to whip up nationalism at every opportunity.,?
6025,"We open our doors to anybody who wishes to join the Republican Party."  A quote by Ben Nicholas.

Too young to retire   will consider that maybe in another 7-10 yrs....  RM is RM  just ignore him   like a few others on here...  Best one to ignore is the guy with the big load on the back end....   Got him on invisible.,?
6047,The prior administration had 8 years to do get started and failed just like the ones prior.,?
6048,America first and nobody else.,?
6049,A somewhat naive op piece. NK is the buffer that keeps US bases and missiles away from the Chinese border. That's why China will never accept regime change in NK. The Author has a short memory  or did he ever study history a bit  in particular the Korean war? The USAF  under its commander Gen Curtis E. LeMay  flattened most of North Korea's 72 cities and killed over 8 million civilians (LeMay even bragged about it). That is not lost on the NK regime. The US has been advocating regime change in NK  preferably for a puppet of the US's own choosing  and been conducting large and aggressive live-fire manoeuvres close to NK's border for years; yet  the 'West' does not see that as a provocation. North Korea seeks a non-aggression pact with the US  but the US refuses to even meet. So who is the threat here? NK knows that those countries that abandoned their nuclear programs were subsequently destroyed by the US (Iraq and Libya). So Un has no incentive to disarm faced with US hostility.,?
6050,Is Trump a President or not? Does he have rights to talk to anyone he wants/needs to talk to? He has a constitutional right to dismiss/close any investigation is he believes it's not appropriate or necessary. Schiff is a useless piece of nothing - DemocRATS should shut up and start working for our country and our peple - we're sick of their stupidity.,?
6051,Most intelligent people dodge stupid questions.,?
6052,I agree with all of the second part of your post  so I wonder why huge deficits are a great thing when both Japan and Britain had an negative experience doing the same thing  under much worse conditions.,?
6053,Very disingenuous of them to turn an argument about an offensive name into their food items. I won't be surprised if they chose the name only for publicity to stand out from others in this food-saturated city -- any publicity is good publicity.,?
6054,Complete or perfect?  No none is that  'perfect' at anything.  Both would give P.T. Barnum a run for his money  though!  And both found their own brand of 'sucker's born every minute'!  H. L. Mencken almost always prevails!,?
6055,What you refuse to accept  Mr. Conklin  is that this aina was taken illegally by haole business men of America who  like you t believed they had the right as a superior  mightier race.  Racist in Hawaii was born from this one  historic act.  And for America's part in causing this sinful act of aggression  they apologized.  You however  and those of your ilk  are deaf  blind and dumb to this truth.,?
6056,I hate it when a reporter makes the false claim that the weather or geography cause air pollution. The pollutants are caused by the low-temperature burning  not the weather.  Also  the wind doesn't "cleanse" the air  it merely allows for some dilution of the pollutants.  One serious consequence of particulate pollution that never gets mentioned hereabouts  although the research supporting it started appearing in the literature in 2009  is its impact on intelligence. Particulate pollution has been found to decrease intelligence at a level similar to what happens when children eat lead paint chips.,?

6062,But did he have any attack chickens? Saw a pop up selling full auto assault chickens  And there is no background check to own and can be easily concealed and are even allowed in schools.

6072,Poor poor Pocho.  Please learn the difference between the national debt and the budget deficir/surplus. The national debt is the summation of all past deficits and surpluses.  Under Obama the budget deficit generally went down.  Yes under Obama the national debt went up but that was only because of the idiotic practices of the previous republican president.  When will you idiots ever learn that you can not balance the budget by reducing revenue and increasing wasteful spending?  Ever?,?
6073,Or  they're simply aware that history is the best predictor of the future and are taking a proactive stance on preventing the inevitable problems that come with MOST homeless.,?
6074,Obama is your war monger. 2 full terms of war. Killed more Muslims then the Spanish Inquisition. Bombed 7 countries. Trump has not done anything yet.,?
6075,I think selection someone from the outside does not sit well with HSTA and others although this would probably be the best  thing to do.  I would agree that the two finalists may not be impressive at least on paper but who knows. I suspect that the push for a local person may be coming from the Guv's wife and perhaps the Guv himself although from the shadows and not in the open.  It had been speculated that Darrel Galera who had withdrawn  from applying for the job had the backing of  the Guv's wife and probably the Guv himself.  One possibility is that these two finalists were purposely chosen  to create  a scenario where there would be a call for the search and selection process to start all over so that "the right person" was selected. A conspiracy theory I agree but anything is possible in our banana republic of Hawaii.,?
6076,You must be one of those people who don't own a gun either where is the muzzle flash lmao. Get a gun and shoot your eye out you will lmao. You must be from the Christmas story little ralphy lol.,?
6077,Well its not just the judge's impartiality that will now be called into question by women  other cultures  minorities and just about every one else it will be his intelligence..  What will the perception of a woman be who brings a sexual assault charge forward and there is the  judge hearing the case who is openly advertising he is a Trump fan? A man who is being defined as a misogynist?  I really hope he is censured for stupidity,?
6078,After last night's admission that he may not accept the results of the election  it seems rather obvious that Trump planned on losing all along - that his bid to run for the highest office in the land was nothing more than a reality-show ruse to launch Trump TV Network after the election with his new  built-in base of alt-right Breitbart readers to add fuel to the fire. He'll even keep Steve Bannon on to run the show  merely stamping the Trump name onto the new venture like he does all those buildings in New York in which he has no real financial interest at all. As with everything else about Donald Trump  it's all for show. There's no there there. He's become nothing more than a tacky franchise.  I have to wonder how his loyal band of followers must feel knowing that they've been played for fools and idiots. If they haven't yet figured it out they're more foolish than I realized - and that's saying something!,?
6079,"Muslims are being targeted now not only in Canada but across Western liberal democracies." the authors ---------------------- Muslims might do a little soul searching and ask why Muslims are targeted and not Sikhs  Hindus  Buddhists  ...at least not to the same extent  As Trudeau would say find the root cause?  Is it problems of integration  assimilation  accommodation ...?,?
6080,Don't know about you  but I actually live around here. And I'm really tired of idiots from back east. If they have all the answers  let them demonstrate that in their own home states.,?
6081,You get what you believe is true! Therefore believe nothing you hear   research what you read and believe half of what you see. Never trust anyone running or is in politics. Once elected the sit on their brains and go crazy. They never hear you after elected. They want everything of everybody else's and believe because they got elected they are smarter and better than riff-raff voters who is not in office. It's a private club and voters only allowed at elections to keep voters thinking they have a voice. No voice except to vote same class of elite  rich connected to corporate  idiots each election for you to pay and pay and pay for their trip through  the hellholes of politics.,?
6082,You are an idiot. Laws were broken and US assets were sold by unauthorized personnel who gained financially benefits from the sale. If this were a republican  you would be screaming for prison time.,?

6084,"“Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States  he may by proclamation  and for such period as he shall deem necessary  suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants  or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.”  That's the exact text of the law Trump's executive order was based on. Seems pretty clear he has the authority. If this law was unconstitutional  why didn't the judges say so? This law was not shot down or even addressed by the 9th Circuit. In fact  it was not mentioned even once in the 29-page opinion issued by the 9th Circuit. Oversight? Intentional omission? Who knows  but the Supreme Court will overturn their ruling accordingly on these grounds alone.,?
6085,Agreed  Mason II  but than again every state in the nation has DUI provisions that ALLOW people to get more than one DUI and they can still keep their driver's license after paying their fine(s) and jail time.,?
6086,Indeed Buffett  and Berkshire follow the mantra of buy stock as if you intend to hold it forever.  However  that has never precluded him or the company from taking comparatively short positions.  As a buy and hold investor myself  I have never walked away from an sound investment opportunity that met my objectives albeit with an intended shorter duration.  Or for that matter even higher risk speculative investments.  But they still comprise a very small portion of the total portfolio.  I have been investing for around 30 years and can't ever remember a period when the airlines would have been considered stable buy and hold investments.  At least in the sense that most people would define it.  I don't see that things have really changed all that much.,?
6087,Funny that on Twitter Trump called Obama a racist  but I guess that dos not count.  Obama had work to do an never mentioned it. Poor Donnie  criticism he cannot take. I guess being such an egotestical idiot  his feelings are hurt when his actions and statements on racism shows him to be a true white supremacist.,?
6088,After years of careful nurturing  tax morality is now effectively on the skids. A tragedy. Whether this will impact significantly on actual collections remains to be seen. I believe that it will over time and we will see the type of situation that devastated Greece. The most destructive side effect of declining receipts is the need for government to borrow to make up the difference. This makes them extremely vulnerable because this is where investors (across the entire spectrum) can step in and initiate an equally effective revolt without breaking any laws. Holders of cash can move it abroad and out of reach. Local investors can put pressure on banks and fund managers not to lend to government through the bond and capital markets. Those who talk of an outright tax revolt should switch their focus to this equally effective method of forcing government to listen. The real power of the electorate does not vest in the ballot it lies in the power of their cash & their ability to withhold it,?
6089,Someone needs to remind Brad Wall that he is the elected rep of just over 1 000 000 Canadians (3% only).  The big 3 provinces  which seem to be in accord with this deal  represent 25 000 000 of Canada's 36 000 000 people.  Let's keep things in perspective.  Majority still does rule  Mr. Wall.,?
6090,Misallocation of police resources and a failure to touch the social issues behind terrorism at all  are the obvious culprits. To my mind 3 000 possible troublemakers can be watched closely but you can't do it with 18th C policing techniques and by continuing what appear to be overtime grabs when nearly ten times as more officers show up at accident scenes than are needed. Most of these officers need to be 'following' the troublemakers  using 21st C. investigative techniques.,?
6091,Now what will Buck do....who will tell him how to vote  what to say  and who to screw?!!,?

6094,Raised in Chugiak  my Dad did not talk like that  nor was he gay  or known to lie.  I do not talk like that. I'm neither gay or lying about how I talk.  My friends do not talk like that. Some of my friends are gay  but so what?  Grabbing someone by the p---y is sexual assault. Bragging about it is disgusting and reprehensible.  You Trump fanatics are a deplorable bunch who don't have a clue what being an honorable man is all about.,?
6095,Oh boo hoo  there are plenty of women who get together and talk the same way about men  gather in groups to watch 50 Shades of Grey and then go back to their positions of power the next day. So quit acting all shocked and appalled. People are people  and most are hypocrites.,?
6096,Now funding "oppo research" with ties to the Russian govt is a good thing- Democrats  as of 10/24/17.,?
6097,Then first year college students don't know what they are talking about  serge2016  and one hopes they can do better by third or fourth year. Our voting processes are based on one person one vote  but not our political systems. They are based on reasoned debate  on listening to one another in search of clarity or here-to-fore unseen options  and on decision making  which often includes votes.,?
6098,And you know this how?  Doubling down on ignorance only makes you more ignorant. Quit while you're ahead.,?
6099,You have never heard President Trump say anything racist but you can sure contrive to make up his thoughts  you are a liar.,?

6101,Yes  and Hillary has lizard blood.,?
6102,This vile trash lives and breathes on lies  while calling the media dishonest and fake.  For example  Cheeto Hitler has repeatedly described his victory over Hillary Clinton as a “historic” and “massive” landslide. That’s not the case. His Electoral College victory actually ranks 46th out of 58 presidential elections. He lost the popular vote to Clinton by about 2.8 million votes.  That's hardly “historic” and the furthest thing from “massive.” This is a flat-out lie  even if you allow a little embellishment for the sake of a good story.  Two questions for ADN readers: 1) Is anyone else concerned that this spitting  gesticulating  tantrum-throwing toddler has the nuclear codes? 2) How long before the idiots that voted for him realize and admit their mistake?,?
6103,OMG this is by far the most stupidest comment I have read yet!  Get back to reality here Chris Linder.  Educate yourself.  I know personally why the 76 yr old lady jumped.  I know why another person jumped as well.  NO DRUGS FOR EITHER.  Stupid stupid stupid!  Are you on said drugs?,?
6104,LOS...you could be right...lies  steeling  sexual harassment  tax evasion  stealing from his foundation...nothing will sow regrets in the addled toadies. Really nothing...they have their guy  they like his attitude...very much a professional wrestler  don't they know it's bogus  really. He was outclassed and out maneuvered. He was ill-mannered and ill-prepared. He looked silly  peering into the lights. And 85 million got to see him in all his glory! Not little news sound bites designed to make him seem possible  but the full sniveling  snorting  bull crap artist he has always been  and will always be. So ask yourself  "why do I like this?",?
6105,Let Adam Smith simplify: "For one very rich man  there must be five hundred poor  and the influence of the few supposes the indigence of the many."  Those who receive the most 'benefit' of a nationality ought to contribute the most to that nationality: they live with exponentially greater luxury  they should pay an exponentially greater share. It's not by the sale of their own blood that earned their luxury  but by the sale of others. If you get rich by selling your OWN blood  then I say hands off your riches. Alas most people have the same amount of their OWN blood to sell  so any richness must derive from shedding or coercing it from others. And P.S. - Who subsidized the Banks that were Too Big too Fail?,?
6106,You absolutely cannot be a part-time Premier in Canada.  This is one sick joke.  He has to resign immediately.  There is no excuse on the planet that could be acceptable.  Even the Cons can't defend this fool.,?
6107,Well said. What I also don't understand is where were all these SJW's when they had the choice between the $29 Chinese made  toaster or the $79 Canadian made toatser made by Canadians with good wage factory jobs? I suppose only the bad conservatives shopped in walmart because the SJW's were buying the triple the price Canadian made product...........right! As you said  Hypocrite!!!,?
6108,The GOP isn't embracing a bigoted  sanctimonious pedophiles?  Good  sensible call.  I'm glad they have driven all such scumbags out of the party.  Oh  wait a minute . . .,?
6109,I made it about 30% through this article.. You include an anonymous source that says .. in so many words .. that he won't be able to make any headway as Mayor.  And that has always been one of Oregon's biggest problems - There are too many people in politics that are in it for their own interests  their companies interests - if you don't play ball with the big boys - you don't make it long term. But playing ball with the big boys is never the best outcome for the actual constituents.,?
6110,AK Jen - Russia is no longer a communist nation. Stop spouting that -  it makes you look stupid.,?
6111,Doesn't really reduce heat. Blacktop  or pavement  absorbs and retains heat more capably than roofs. Uses more water in a water resource scarce climate  on rooftops with no shade over the plants  resulting in a faster evaporation cycle for water. It may or may not be good for the environment  there's much in play with that.  The soil doesn't absorb moisture  like it would at ground level  so any excess is drained off and added to the water treatment system. Not being able to have deep roots  using fertilizers  it will likely be an issue the public won't be aware of. Similar to the ethanol mandate (on a smaller level)  with drainoff really messing up the Mississippi delta flowing out to the gulf.  But it feels good.... for some to say something's being done for the environment. If it's about oxygen and air quality  it would make more sense to mandate property owners plant a large tree every 100 feet of property line. It would also be less expensive  initially and in lifetime costs.,?

6117,Actually  Alaska statutes on use of deadly force are very clear in their application to areas outside your home including defense of property and do not solely apply to your residence. People stealing tv's from Walmart  no. Getting car jacked  robbed  or rushed by a rioting mob in the parking lot  yes. What are you reading in the statute that isn't clear?,?
6118,"Typical behavior for folks who don't stand for anything unless it increases their vote total."  DIW  I love you for this comment. You do realize the Republican Party  traditionally associated with smaller government  free trade  and Evangelical Christianity  is now the party voicing full-throated support for a $1 trillion infrastructure bill  massive tariffs on foreign goods  and a man who once stated gamely that he liked to grab women 'by the pussy'?   A party of principles  no doubt.,?
6119,I was born in Eugene and have lived all but 5 or 6 of my 60 years within a 70 mile radius (even lived in Eugene once  in the early 80's).  Now  I am embarrassed to admit that I live here.  I would NEVER live in Eugene again  there isn't enough time in the rest of my life to fix what the morons in charge of the city have created.,?
6120,You left out the Reagan Recession when unemployment hit near 11 percent  worse at its peak than the Bush-GOP Great Recession of 2007-09. Look one more time at the charts I posted. These are facts  and you can cheery pick snapshots in time but the overall trends are indisputable. The economy always fares better under Democratic administrations than Republican ones.,?
6121,I disagree  Trump doesn't need to accomplish anything to win again  he just needs to keep fighting the corrupt swamp politicians and washington and calling out the lying media. As long as he fights with the parasites he could accomplish nothing and still get re elected. That is how much the globalist parasites are hated.,?
6122,But what about free crap for people? We just can't cut spending... That's too hard... and people need stuff... you must be a racist because you disagree with me... (Sry  my inner millennial just popped out.),?

6129,The Alaska Performance Scholarship is a boon to high school seniors in Alaska. It is a streamlined approach to awarding qualifying students aid for college expenses. Not only is it important financially  but it is also a source of pride for these students - which may be the most important reason to keep the APS in place  and thus help to ensure that these students attend college  and graduate  with degrees.,?
6130,Actually  it is illegal:  52 US Code § 30121. Contributions and donations by foreign nationals (a) Prohibition It shall be unlawful for— (1) a foreign national  directly or indirectly  to make— (A) a contribution or donation of money or other thing of value  or to make an express or implied promise to make a contribution or donation  in connection with a Federal  State  or local election; (B) a contribution or donation to a committee of a political party; or (C) an expenditure  independent expenditure  or disbursement for an electioneering communication (within the meaning of section 30104(f)(3) of this title); or (2) a person to solicit  accept  or receive a contribution or donation described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1) from a foreign national.  "Dirt" on Hillary would have been without a doubt a "thing of value" for the Trump campaign. Violation of this provision is punishable by fines (which are probably irrelevant to the Trumps) or up to 5 years in prison.,?

The treaty is STILL VALID and RECOGNIZED as such by the (40) First Nations of North America tribes/ a peace treaty that is recognized today as a political  diplomatic and military event of great importance in the history of North America. The “Montréal Peace Treaty” provided a framework for relations between the signatory Aboriginal nations and its terms remained fresh in their collective memory... (more to come),?

6140,The politics of government at every level  is depressing to say the least. If what we have in office and running for office now  are the cream of the crop  we've got a terrible failed crop! It's hard not to be ashamed at what goes on  especially right here at our own state level. Our legislators must have no conscience at all or simply have no values or morals they can relate to? It can't be fixed because the same people will be voted right back into office come election time. Perhaps we should be blaming ourselves  more than we blame our legislators. They can't help being greedy and stupid. We feed them like Pavlov's slobbering dogs!,?

Again  how much starvation  suffering  bloodshed and the like would have resulted if everyone who disliked apartheid had downed tools  destroyed commerce and refused to go to work until the ANC was installed?   Damn. I've got Greenfly on my roses. I think I'll buy some petrol  pour it onto them and set it alight  that'll definitely kill the cursed things. It worked!  Damn again........how come the rose bushes are dead?

6152,I see that the US Supreme Court decided three more cases without the presence of Justice Scalia or a replacement.  One unanimous decision  and the other two each had one dissenter. (7-1)    That gets us up to thirty-six (36) cases decided since Scalia's death which were either unanimous or his absence made no difference in the outcome.  The last few decisions have the rest of this month and the month of June to go.  I bet the Democratic Republic will still be standing on June 30  2016  despite the 'missing' Justice.,?
6153,The NY Times just posted a presidential poll in todays paper that was pre DNC and Swartz high jacking the party but the truth is being ignored. The Times Bias pro Clinton agenda  and the democratic parties lack admitting the wrong doings  and rectifying them "Hillary needs to step down. Her and Swartz have completely lost credibility" You can keep reporting things that make you feel good but that won't change the fact that soon the polls are going to be horrible. By the way the Clinton Foundation took contributions from BlackWater WorldWide in 2008 Hillary voted to invade Iraq  and is just as guilty of the Bush war crimes killing millions of innocent Iraqis  and the death  and injury of or soldiers that led to the creation of the current Terror problem.  Her judgment cannot be trusted. We don't want change later change in 4 years  or 8 we want it NOW!,?
6154,What is sad are phony conservatives  who now that they have gotten their's are fine with screwing others who have not received anything.  Pathetic. f,?
6155,I live in the RTP area of North Carolina  where three major state-supported research universities and one obscenely well-funded private research university (Duke University) regularly pump out college graduates . . . and college drop-outs.  In addition  RTP is filled with high-tech research jobs in the pharma industry  among others.  While you can  indeed  land an entry-level job with a mere 4 year degree (from anywhere - local headhunters rarely care where you went to school) locally  the labor market for those positions fluctuates wildly.  With as many M&As as there are  lay-offs are common.  Meanwhile  local tradesmen have made a bundle off of the development and maintenance of their PhD clients. And they never get laid off.  Most are self-employed or small business.  Very secure.  Meanwhile  guy who makes my coffee is a former professor.,?
6156,He's a buffoon and a liar.,?

6160,[Yes  I certainly lost interest in trying to maintain meaningful dialogue when you called my arguments "retarded".] It seems that you gave up earlier than that. [And there you go again with Biden "idiocy".] Let's get this straight.  You don't think that when Biden included it in his speech it wasn't an idiotic dereliction of duty owed under the Constitution's separation of powers?  It isn't just as idiotic  if not more so  when the Republicans don't actually talk about it but actually DO IT for a far longer period of time and without any consideration to due process ON TOP OF the Biden's idiocy? Now I expect you to still not actually give any consideration to the actual substance of the argument and just focus on the usage of the term "idiot" like a child would.,?
6161,This is the Gov't seeking input???  I found the page that has the committee review dates and places. http://www.ontla.on.ca/web/committee-proceedings/committee_business_agendas.do?locale=en&BillID=4963%20&detailPage=agendas&CommID=144&BusinessType=Bill Only the first week is listed.  Interesting reading who is being allowed to speak at these committee hearings.,?

6163,James Reese commands mercenary group  TigerSwan who attacked peaceful protestors at Standing Rock. He also was arrested for assulting a female  and his wife filed a restraining order against him. James Reese should be the next FBI Director? No way! More like James Reese should be the next person incarcerated. Lock up that piece of shit!,?
6164,You don't seem to be able to convince anyone with that nonsensical argument  greg. The more you repeat it the sillier it gets.,?

6170,Rubio was a much more conservative candidate than Trump was. I don't see it flipping.  And  if we only get FULL repeal ONLY of hat disaster known as ObamaCare  the GOP will keep the House and Senate in2018. Let us pray for repeal only.,?

6172,I told you people to CANCEL MY SUBSCRIPTION.  How many more stupid and inappropriate emojis am I going to have to place here before you get the message?  By the way  gonna miss your predictably Lefty but also just plain contrarian comments and emojis Alceste  old girl.  I know  I know though your mom won't admit it...you're a boy.

6175,This is what's dreadfully wrong with our so-called judicial system; criminals can do harm and get away with it.  I don't  care if the spouse went along to get along with her husband.  Children were sexually abused and didn't even know that the sexual predator was planning to kill them.  The spouse deserves a minimum of 10-years.,?
6176,Trump is quite the hypocrite.  If you subsitute Blacks or Muslims for the neo-Nazis  Trump would have sent in the National Guard  who would have pepper-sprayed and shot them. Then  he would have declared martial law and had every Black and Muslim person arrested if they were out after dusk.,?
6177,No logic and stupid ?  A person in cold water can go below the surface in 30 seconds and not come up   where as opposed to one wearing a life jacket  they have many minutes to be rescued .,?
6178,Until DA 's start seeking the death penalty and juries convict these killers and judges sentences are enforced the message will never be sent that it is dire consequences if you commit murder!  You will pay with your own life period!  These morons walking up to law enforcement and killing them has to end and one way to limit the actions is to know that these people will pay dearly!,?
6179,Now hear this  Senators and Represetatives  "it is within the law" is NOT an acceptable answer to anything  ever. If your moral compass cannot tell you what is wrong and right you have no business dealing with public business. Slavery was legal  it was illegal for two races to marry  woman could not vote legally  in some states you could beat your wife legally. Bribery is legal its called lobbying  it is legal for President Trump to benefit from being President but is it just?  $800 on two pairs of glasses? Collecting public money at a publicly subsidized cafeteria and then pocketing the money is legal but  not okay with any one out side of Juneau. Kelly what you are doing is bullshit not reporting it. Neuman  you're a disgrace  and the worst of the bunch. But the cake has to be Anchorage Christian Schools giving money away that parents pay in tuition and make kids sell chocolate to help keep cost down  shame on you  shame.,?
6180,And even with that total war effort involving military spending approaching 50% of GDP  Canada still could not have defended itself against attack by a major power. However  the US was an ally  not an enemy  and the only other countries with the naval capacity to launch an invasion were either allies (the UK) or unfriendly but not interested in Canada (Japan).  The only remotely possible way for Canada to defend itself is to follow France's example and build our very own nuclear deterrent. Given the lack of credible threats  I do not support that idea.,?
6181,Who's to say this meeting isn't a false trail of breadcrumbs to direct away from actual collusion? The FSB is certainly sophisticated enough to set up a fallback story like this one.,?
6182,The drugs wars are just that  violent criminal wars.  Innocent people have died by the thousands and more death lies ahead.       The US is in that war and we will have casualties.     So take your self righteous attitude and find me a half dozen military commanders who have never made a combat decision that cost lives?  Tell me war zone battles have perfect information and every operation goes without a hitch.  Tell me that bombs have never been dropped on our own troops.  Tell me that good people haven't died in clandestine operations in foreign countries that the public will never know about.    So you took the death of two American citizens and led their family to believe that they died for no reason at all.  That the United States government is incompetent and corrupt and that led to the death of their loved ones.  You would ruin the memories of loved people  just to score a political point.   That stinks.    Patriot? I think not.,?
6183,And that is your problem.   You are ‘incited’ to violence by mere disagreement with someone else.    It’s pathetic.,?
6184,Always blame the other.,?
6185,You don't have a clue what gerrymandering is. The state boundaries emerged over the last two centuries! You want the US to follow Germany and Sweden into third world status?,?

6188,I am far less inclined to focus on their reflection and instead i would insist  as part of parole or whatever  on people being studied electronically..brain scans  pupil dilation studies etc.  I would get a history on everyone..well  I guess that would be reflection.  Two questions:  Yes  but I don't know how much and yes. And not just training  but the selection process.  And yes  the whole culture for a really really long time.  There is a reason that there has been so little shock about this in some clerical circles  because somehow it became normalized.  The really really bad sin was seeing a woman and dealing with children  especially boys who could not get pregnant  avoided that.  That is the key to the stupidity of the bishops  popes etc...it is NORMAL to them  even if they do not do it.,?
6189,Anti-vaccine fools reap what you sow.,?
6190,This DACA thing shows how bad our immigration enforcement is.  If a young illegal alien can live their whole childhood in the US until adulthood without apparent fear of deportation  then obviously the law isn't being enforced.  We should figure out a way to deport these illegal kids before they are socialized in the US and it becomes this much of a shock to them.  Maybe stake out schools with directional mics and listen for foreign languages being spoken.  Maybe paying teachers and students to inform on the illegal kids.  There's got to to be something we can do.,?
6191,They're not committed to controlling spending.   They're committed to growing government.  Here's something that the RG fails to mention:  Outdoors promotion  A state Office of Outdoor Recreation would be created under House Bill 3350  which was approved by the Senate 19-11 and now goes to the governor.  Backed by Bend-area hiking  kayaking  and mountain climbing businesses  the office will promote the kind of lifestyle that just landed Bend on the cover of Outside Magazine’s list of best places to live.   From the Bend Bulletin.,?
6192,Notice how the media still pretends the status quo for refugee resettlement  unlimited immigration and globalization are still the norm when the majority of Canadians  along with the rest of the western world is shunning the politics of liberal leaders like Merkle and Trudeau.,?

6196,How does a known Russian spy get dual citizenship.  The U.S. government won't even let it's citizens have dual citizenship  unless your super rich and powerful  but some Russian spy gets to parade around as a lobbyist and work with the Trump administration to subvert our elections ?  This guy is still upright and breathing in our country ??????  Disgusting pigs have taken our country over and all of the news outlets  TV  radio  internet media  are all on the take  and the only way you can make it big is to play ball  talk positive  talk god  and shut up.

6199,"participate in this marriage celebration" What's the "participation"? They were asked to bake a cake. If a straight friend had placed the order would the bake know any different? That would be blind justice  in a way. What you don't know won't trigger your prejudices.,?
6200,Canadians don't want to be sold off to corporations world-wide in the first place. We are trying to recover from that  already  and want our governments to stay in Canada and work FOR Canada  use Canadian money in Canada and stop subsidizing lobbyists who are trying to take all of our pubic assets.,?
6201,What a disgusting  pathetic Justice System we have.   This is such a disgrace.........$1000.00 and a 6 month suspension?   Wow......just Wow.   This was a Mother of 3  Wife  and daughter  cruelty to an animal probably has harsher charges.    And the Liberals keep getting rid of the good the Conservatives brought in to deal with this limp judgments.    She should of got manslaughter.,?

6204," They roughed up and verbally harassed an innocent person." . Says who? There is no evidence of that.,?
6205,You would have thought that the police would have had more brains when it came to laying this charge. The whole thing was stupid and it cost us taxpayers thousands of dollars for the arrest  the charge  the crown prosecution  the court time and the judge! There is no telling for stupid but the police went above and beyond stupid when they laid this charge. Worse  having the case deservedly thrown out  it will encourage more people to pull the same stunt.,?

6212,There are a lot more ridings in BC than Vancouver. A lot more of us in the outer reaches of the Empire are more concerned with Jobs  Education  and Health Care. The Federal NDP should take note also.  We are into survival not useless arguments.,?
6213,Its like everyone forgets that the best part of requiring everyone to have insurance is that when the dude shows up at the emergency room with a broken leg or worse and no insurance the government doesn't have to bail out the hospital when its not able to collect.

The solar cars might or might not help to show people that power from the sun will be a part of our future. Toyota will soon be offering a solar roof as an option on one of their Prius models (Prius Prime).  I don't think this option will be available in North America.,?

6224,Yeah  he's an idiot.  But if he is an idiot: a) that's what Alaska deserves and b) he will likely be our next governor.  On a somewhat positive note regarding Dunleavy: Begich would tax Alaska to death and the only people with jobs would be unionized state employees.  Walker would spend another term in Korea or China trying to sell Alaska gas that can't compete with the many other LNG sources in the world.  And Walker would neglect the re-making of Alaska from a $100 oil to a $45 paradigm  and spend his time on his pet fantasy project ... like he has done his entire term.  At least Dunleavy knows what the word "cut" means. He would cut too much in the view of the Alaskans (people like Cole and Wohlforth) that think everything should be free and government should be huge.  But large  private-sector-like  downsizing cuts to the state beauracracy are what Alaska needs  and no one has had the backbone to do this.,?

6234,That disgusting language you are so offended by from me wasn't disgusting when you voted for the guy who actually did brag about grabbing strangers' p-- and who did brag about barging in on teenaged girls who are dressing/undressing. That disgusting segregationist racist behavior wasn't enough to keep you from voting for and still defending the guy who actually perpetrated the illegal anti-black racist segregationist acts. Save the pretense. Stop going all Scarlett O'Hara with the vapors with me when I'm just reminding you of the actual words and actual actions of the lecherous racist Trump University fraudster you actually voted for and continue to defend even after he states that some neo-Nazis are "good people" and retweets white supremacists.,?

6245,I agree wholeheartedly with Lynn Porter.  We need an immediate initiative to designate 4-6 safe camping areas in Eugene/Springfield.  These would entail having a designated  trained point person  or leader  for each  along with posted hours of occupancy  and a portable  lockable storage compartment for each site.  This can easily be done for a 2-month trial basis. It is both humanitarian and financially expedient.  City councilors  please note  and address.,?

6248,Coach Taggart meant what he said. Buckle Up. I knew him to be a good X's and O's guy following him at WKU and USF but given the resources he has now  the sky is the limit for him. He's made it cool to go to OR again in a span of 5 months. That is incredible considering he had no affiliation with the school before hand. He was smart enough to recruit the current roster first. Recruited the seniors and made them feel that they are needed and wanted. Once he wins some games the program will be totally his.,?
6249,Wow! Trump really is as dumb as he looks. Putin is probably loving every second of this fiasco! What a dangerous game to play.... If that idiot does get elected than this country deserves what it's going to get.

6258,More talking points with no supporting information.  Home schoolers do best! By what measures and by whose standards?  I find it amazing that in every post about home schools I have never found anyone promoting the system who admits there are unsuccessful students in that system.

You gotta get off this racist defense...showing your true favorite colors?,?
6261,How did government guarantees make insurers unable to write coverage? It shows how unworkable Obamacare was without fixes. Without a meaningful enforceable mandate  something's dems didn't want and now stupid republicans eliminated  there's no way to make this work. Reinsurance has nothing to do with this. No carrier can make this work and it doesn't matter if they're first level coverage or some level above that.,?

As the department’s principal executive officer  Sam oversees six divisions  an annual operating budget of over $200 million  and more than 1 700 employees."  "A lifelong Alaskan born in Juneau and having lived in Tenakee Springs  Douglas  Palmer  Eagle River  and Halibut Cove  Sam graduated from Chugiak High School. A veteran who served two tours of duty in Vietnam in the U.S. Navy  Sam received the Award for Alaska’s Outstanding Vietnam Veteran by the National No Greater Love Foundation. He holds an Associate of Arts degree from the University of Alaska Anchorage."  "Sam is an avid fisherman  having fished commercially with his family for 25 years in Kachemak Bay and sport fished throughout Alaska. He is an outdoorsman and has hunted in central and southeast Alaska over the years."  --from the AK State website,?
6281,A welcome caution from Mr. Radwanski.  The CPC isn't just having "a moment" of vulnerability; they've been without coherent policies or a centre of gravity since the person who essentially created--and defined--them quit.  Stephen Harper ran the CPC pretty much as a dictatorship  and attracted followers with few viable policy ideas of their own to offer. Their main values to him were blind obedience and a talent for sneering at the opposition. The vacuum Harper left won't easily be filled--especially since  his approaches to policy and governing have already been rejected by voters.  What are the alternatives--to both Harper and his policies?  The party needs to be redefined  and that is what this leadership race is really about. It's not just about who will be crowned leader of a party with a long-established set of broadly attractive policies. They're starting almost from scratch  and just being opposed to the current government  as they are now  isn't enough to win them power.,?
6282,Who the hell are you to call someone a REAL black?,?
6283,Crappy decision from a crappy league with crappy owners and a crappy president. I certainly hope there are players who decide to take the year off and participate anyway. And BTW  don't forget to watch the women's hockey championships. They ARE deserving of much more support.,?
6284,The amount of garbage dumping  poaching  meth cooking  and other negative actions on our public lands are good reasons for closing roads.  The good news?  If you walk in  there are no bozos in big trucks with guns and it's just you and the natural world.  After having a few threatening interactions with stupid white guys in big trucks with guns  I ONLY go on the roads that are gated  it seems they are also lazy and afraid to get out of their vehicles.  I say let's give the wildlife some habitat; I'm really sick of the attitude that public lands are only for humans- we are in the midst of the sixth mass species extinction and it is human caused; the biggest reason?  Habitat loss.  Let's wake up to that reality.,?
6285,A baloney poll. I don't know one person who is in favor of the rail. How did they phrase the question in the poll? I call bs.,?

6291,What an incredibly racist comment to make - the GOP Convention of 2016 not only had non-white attendees  they also had non-white presenters and speakers.  You liberals are the most hateful  nasty  racist folks on the planet - hands down.,?
6292,People need to take responsibility and quit making excuses for their actions like this.  I am pretty sure these people chose to do drugs  and the life they are living.,?
6293,Respectfully THOSF  I always save my Colorado mail-in ballots  as I don't even open them up a lot of times. If you do go vote in person here in Denver  the first thing they ask for is a state ID or driver license to verify the person and the address before they print out a ballot. I once  a few years back  tried to tell them I had no ID to see how they'd respond  they get all upset  and told me I needed one in order to vote here in Denver. I didn't push it  but I believe if I had  I'd have been given a different type of ballot  one to be counted long after the election once verified.  Secondly  mail-ins can be checked by signature match I do believe when verification is questioned  people steal mail everyday in today's world. I use separate signatures professionally  one for the mundane every day stuff  the other articulated for security verification. I don't trust mail-in's either.  Florida required me as a felon to petition for my right to vote to be restored by executive clemency.,?

6297,I am laughing my butt off here.....  I spent 20 years in this building  well  actually 19 years  and nearly one in the Northwest corner of the old City Hall whilst it was being built.  There was a time whence KFC had a front there  as well as other establishments that served food  and up to the Lee family business  which they ran well  as well as representations of the Covenant House  which did NOT run so well  and for the entire time  sometimes better  but mostimes worse  the Transit Center was a place of crime.  I cannot count the number of times I had seen committed within the context of drug dealing utilizing underage runners from the now nonexistent Inlet Inn back and forth to the Transit Center  the Covenant House kids taking part in illegal activities  not only within impunity  but with full support of their sponsors  individuals passed out all over the place  marked by traffic cones  etc.  But it was never an issue  so long as it was contained within the Transit Center.  Idiots,?
6298,Canada needs to show the way by taxing all religious organizations. Make them pay property and income tax. That will gradually be the demise of the corporate sheep herders. Then we can concentrate on climate and the economy.,?

6304,I wondered exactly how much United Airlines can actually be responsible for? They did have the right to remove Dr. Dao but they were not responsible on how Dr. Dao was removed. That falls on the airport police who do NOT answer to United Airlines. (Many apparently believes they do.) Once law enforcement arrived at the scene  everyone else become a secondary status as it is in any situation of this nature. Obviously  United wanted that passenger removed but airport police were the ones that determined how that passenger was to be remove. People and city of Chicago will probably end up footing for all the compensations once the emotional and outrage feeling toward United are removed from the equation. Airport police were pretty stupid in the way they handled this entire affair. An more intelligent approach would have save everyone a lot of headaches but that is what you got when everyone involved  got the case of the stupid!!!,?
6305,no  but it was stupid,?
6306,Looking at the difference in what I paid for my F350 and the sticker price on this unit my gas is covered for the next 15 years.  Plus I can haul firewood and pull my 8000 lb camper.  Life is good.,?
6307,Laughable.  Ignorant response from a hate-filled idiot.  First of all  I didn't claim he endorsed her  I said he "supported" her.  Secondly  the video  which you obviously couldn't be bothered to watch  illustrates that the lying liberal consensus is just flat out wrong.  You are being lied to  and you are perpetrating that same lie.  Probably because you're a close-minded hater. The whole point is that smearing people who voted for Trump because a group of racists supports him is no less a smear than calling Hillary Clinton and her voters racists or communists because she was supported by a klansman and the Communist Party USA.  How typical of you to disregard clear proof to further your hate-filled ideology.,?
6308,I agree.  At least it will stop the 'thumb bot' from keep clicking 'thumb down' just to push those they don't like down to the bottom of the rating.  It will at least cut down the number of manipulation because you must post a comment first to rate it.  As I observe  for example  the Chinese 50 cents  just a handful will write comment (in semi-decent English) but a lot more bots to suppress rating of the true Canadian opinion in the old system.  Quite a spectacle especially in the articles about Chinese buyers in the Vancouver real estate market.,?
6309,Murkowski's bio  whether it be Frank or Lisa  will always start "Pandering Politician!"  She is bought and paid for by the Koch conspiracy for the richest 1 %.  She voted for exporting gas which tanked the AK LNG project.   She voted for exporting crude which  market wise  we all pay extra for every day.  She is a bought and paid for shill for the richest of the rich and she panders.  This is a pandering article.  37 years of Murkowskis and Alaska is still voting Murkowski.  What a hoot.  How long do you vote against your own best interests.  Hey.  I got an idea.  We should all vote for BP which at one time was owned 50% by Kuwait.  The Trumpers hate "rag heads" but vote BP.  A voting oxymoron.  Lisa is not voting for anybody that makes less than a million a year.  Not now.  Not ever.   Oxymoron.  An addict doing oxy that will steal your stuff to keep getting high  Like Lisa and campaign contributions.  She steals from us and keeps getting elected.,?

It did not work. Walker failed." Parnell-Lite Continuum. Shameless  Bill Walker. Shameless Bill Walker.,?
6313,I love the "disagree" indicator here.  What's the objection?!  God wants to be with us? God has work to do in us? God wants more out of our vacation than mere dissipation and lassitude? That we should grow closer to God during vacation? That we shouldn't give in to "vegetating"?  The disagree indicator is a sign of the sadness that's in some hearts.    They have no idea Who God is  or what He's trying to do with our lives.  Big shame.    No real vitality.,?

If you people are representing Hillary  then you're doing a terrible job of it. Grow the hell up and go home and think about moving on instead of acting like a bunch of wild animals in the streets with no brains!  All of you are an embarrassment and a spectacle!,?

6328,This article points out the number one problem with politics and career politicians.  Money!  Those elected by the people are there to represent the people.  They are not there to raise money for any party or special interest group.  Being a "paid lobbyist" should be a felony crime!  NO one other than a private citizen should have an elected representative's ear and No organization should be writing checks to influence politics!   Corruption always follows the money!,?
6329,One day I heard O'Leary spouting off about how disadvantaged people and those unable to fully support themselves should simply be cut off - they were only liable to drag down everyone else.  Unfortunately  this covers a wide range of people who form part of our society.  Their contributions may not be economic consideration for them keeps the rest of us human. O'Leary and Trump are loudmouth louts cut from the same cloth better suited to banana 'republic' dictatorships than democracies.

Sadly  their biggest support for these guys comes from the folks that will suffer the most under either one of them - economic cannon fodder. Give your heads a shake people...,?

6334,When hiring a property manager  do your homework. Start with Google to find property managers in your area  and read the reviews if there are any. Contact at least three and ask for a copy of the contract. It will spell out their responsibilities. Also ask for a copy of thier standard tenant agreement  to see what it covers. Both the contract and rental agreement should be for a period of one year so that you can terminate them if you're unhappy.,?

6341,Here's my suggestion to those who think the police aren't trained well enough  or use excessive force in the exercise of their duties  or who think they can subdue a belligerent  resistant offender peacefully: Agree to be deputized and on call for just such situations where the police are arresting someone and a mob forms threatening the police. We can try your way. There won't be any arguments then about what works. It's like being a conscientious objector in Vietnam. They are the first to pick up the gun when things start going south. How do I know that? First hand experience. Principles and moral judgements are easy when you're viewing from the safety of the sidelines. Being in the mix is something else.,?
6342,lol  no they are angry because Trump thinks a Canadian killing Muslims is evidence that his policies are needed  and angry because 5 year old boys are being handcuffed as security threats. Don't know what to do? They know what to do--resist these dumb policies that are endangering the US!,?
6343,why do they bother quoting real estate agents at all?  That is not information.  Like asking a used car salesman their opinion.  Useless.  Ask a real expert and put that in your headlines not this garbage.,?
6344,it seems you're confusing Libs with the Dems who betray America nearly as much as the farthest right  but rest assured  there will be no help or peace coming for anybody on this planet now that the ultimate worst case scenario has been allowed to happen by the absurdly obsessed I REALLY REALLY Hate Hillary Club  and those who didn't vote for the witch need not be concerned about new cabinet choices as the 360 degree destruction coming is far beyond even their substantial abilities and will make the truly infuriating Obama years to be known as the last of the good old days.  btw  civilbeat  Tim's comments were acceptable  this stupid censorship needs to go!,?
6345,Oh no. Not that "losing an hour of sleep" nonsense again. That's why the time change is done on Saturday night. You won't lose sleep unless you're foolish enough to use an alarm clock on a Sunday morning. (Apologies to those who must work Sundays.)   I know there are studies saying that the change messes people up. How much of that is because thousands of people reading articles like this expect a bad day on Monday? It's only a one-hour change. In ordinary life  it is not unusual for bedtime to vary by an hour because of things we must do in work or social life  or even because there's something good on TV.  The worst part of Daylight Savings Time is changing all of your clocks. I'd be happy to keep DST year-round.,?

6349,I reiterate  your ignorance is profound  and why you make ignorant deluded statements like Reagan killed the unions. In the real world  what killed the unions  is the fact so many had been taken over by organized crime.  To further address your ignorance; before every hire in my lifetime  I negotiated my own wages  and benefits just fine. Furthermore  my Chickasaw mother  ran the medical offices of Reynolds Metals  and the Port of Portland  both of which are union. My mother was non-union  and managed to negotiate better wages  and benefits than the union workers she took care of when they injured themselves on the job. The only people I know who need a union to attain better wages are slackers who let people like me carry their load. People like me always can negotiate better wages our labor produces more than slackers.,?
6350,I still think the motor voter is a stupid attempt at getting more people to vote.  I'm thinking many of the people who get registered through this program just throw the stuff in the trash when it comes in the mail.  It's a waste of tax payer money for the most part.,?

6367,Bang on.   Instead she will hope for a recovery that never comes.,?
6368,I'm noticing a lot of defensive blowback from Trump supporters when an article like this one obliquely compares a dictatorship to some of Trumps latest tweets. I've been to Belarus many times over the last ten years and even though when you're there and everything looks normal  you know behind the scenes it truly is a dictatorship. Citizens have rights to a point  are free to travel and the state looks after them cradle to grave. If you want to do business   you pay a tariff ( bribe) to the necessary official.  I'm not aware that there is any immigration even though you can apply ( for a fee) for an extended visa. If the perpetual president likes you   meaning you make his country look good because it makes him look good  then life is rosy. Th author is merely comparing the lack of liberties she has experienced to future  Trump presidency. Some of his actions  tweets are troubling. We should heed them.,?
6369,Perhaps she can also cover the moron that's supposedly our prime minister.,?

6372,I'm not suggesting decades old estimates are useless  just that they are not terribly accurate.  Even now  CNN had a guest this morning saying they don't have enough advanced equipment to drop an unmanned drone into the centre of every hurricane to measure wind speed.  In many cases they just don't know. . If the info lacks accuracy it is not reasonable to claim with certainty that this is the most powerful storm  not that a tenuous fact is due to climate change when the increased severity is a matter of degrees. . That's not a denial of our impact on the planet  simply a ratcheting back of the hyperbole that sells newspapers,?
6373,Don't be ignorant or silly. The most popular politician in the US is Bernie Sanders because he's calling for a social democratic revolution. Bernie has the passionate support of at least 30 million Americans  mostly young people with nothing to lose and the energy to do something about it.,?

6375,The alternative is to spend wisely on maintaining infrastructure  and growing it to meet the needs.  We've tried to disregard roads and spend on light rail  streetcars and bicycle lanes and paths  and it hasn't done much.  Most of the increase in cycling has come at the expense of inner-city TriMet bus use.  MAX is basically a parking-lot shuttle for downtown government workers  Blazers and Timbers fans  but the entire region is having to pay for that system that serves just 1-2% of the total trips taken in our region  and largely by people who can afford to pay more than 25% of the operating costs of it.  Anti-road critics often criticize road users for not paying their fair share and for congestion  while allowing mass transit to cover even fewer of its costs and justifying empty trains (i.e. WES) while doing nothing about overcrowded buses (because "nobody rides the bus").  Meanwhile  cyclists want more money spent on them...but refuse to accept a tax.,?
6376,Your ignorant and borderline bigoted blast at Catholics is EXACTLY why the Founders' decision to make America secular was the correct one.

Because if the driver wasn't afraid of the cops then he was just a heartless douchebag.   Why is it? Thug or douchebag? You seem to be sticking up for the driver. Why is that? You blamed the driver for the Tudor dog getting hit and now you are blaming a 12 year old CHILD for his dog getting run over by a car. You can't have it both ways.  You friends with the driver young? You need to turn him in ,?

6397,The State should have been more proactive but as a taxpayer can I ask why people like Lorrin Pang spent the last three years protesting farmers and fear mongering meanwhile they were being PAID to protect Maui's Public Health. Seems to me people need to do their job's instead of protesting while on the public payroll. Again farmers are paying the price alongside infected people. Wake up Hawaii We have a very real public health safety issue where the responsible use of crop protection methods and pesticides is required to protect human health and public safety.,?

He said he wants coverage for all  no discrimination based on pre-existing conditions  lower premiums for middle-class families  and no lifetime caps.    And guess what. The new bill does none of those things.  This bill only makes healthcare worse.  Nothing about this bill should be law.,?

People who’ve never had to pay an income tax can’t stand the idea of having to pay and they are the worst ones to scream  and they ARE screaming…… I hear a certain talk radio show in the morning and people call in there and actually BELIEVE that they shouldn’t EVER have to contribute by paying state taxes but they want everything the state has to give them.It's unbelieveable that people in Alaska are so stupid.

As @BillGarber says "There is no escaping Adventism" for the simple reason that people join Adventism do so not for its doctrines but for the psychological needs that can only be supplied by the SDA doctrines. Think in terms of pharmacology. A drug can only work its wonders if there were a receptor for it. Otherwise  it goes through the guts and out the door being a total waste.

Calling someone a "son of a bitch" is a serious insult to the person and  especially  to their mother.  Condemning Mr. Trump's  nasty  disrepectful comments hardly constitutes "bigotry."  Gary Crum,?

6442,We see businesses along Yonge St being forced to close because a quasi-governmental agency  MPAC  assessed their properties at their 'highest value for future use' as if the world has enough wealthy investor-kings to buy the opulent settings of MPAC's dreams.  The Assoc'n of Municipalities of Ontario is begging the province to raise the PST by 1% so GST rises to 14% on goods  increasing costs all around for buyers. Income taxes are up  while the feds ignore world incomes of 10-yr temporary resident visa holders who live here. Gov'ts believe their spending has a 'multiplier effect' on the economy  and so it does when four levels of government & their agencies force up costs -- meaning higher debts & deficits all around. Time for governments to right-size & tighten their own unaffordable budgets. Politician come & go -- the debts keep sky-rocketing. Why did the former Saskatchewan Minister of Immigration set up his own irrigation scheme for Chinese investors? Politics is unaffordable.,?

6451,I find it fascinating that the press focuses on Trump  but does what it can to avoid mentioning the Americans who vote for him. Most of those fellow Americans are not evil  racist  misogynistic devils  but real humans who have been ignored and used by the political and media establishments for years. They had no other champion on the right than Trump.  He had the guts to call out the war loving Bush family  who enriched the oil billionaires with perpetual wars.   Me  I hope Bernie  somehow  gets in  but even I recognize that there are millions of Americans who have no college degree  who have watched their jobs get tossed to China or Mexico  who have watched themselves be mocked in the media  who have watched their kids killed in war that they  have a right to speak.  Divide and conquer has done well by the Republican Party. We now have an election that is listening to some of those left behind. That is what democracy is about.  Hugh Massengill  Eugene,?

6463,I agree. Good reasons to keep trying another way  over and over again. This may be something like trying to change the culture of the KGB. It may not happen  but it could  if there are enough continual attempts that don't really stop or stagnate  at least for long stretches of time. Change has to do with increasing positive driving forces and decreasing negative restraining forces. They can work together to make a different "normal".  Once there's a new normal started  it's a bit easier to figure out what works and what doesn't when determining the next steps.    It wouldn't be correct to suggest that the Church of the 20teens is the same as the Church of the 1950s  would it? There have been important changes that help create the next changes.,?

6473,"I think dragging production back to the US can be very helpful"  Completely wrong.  Look at the Carrier "deal".   The CEO of Carrier has already public stated that he is going to use the $7M in incentives to invest in factory automation that he fully expects to results in fewer jobs in the US.  Dragging production back to the US will not save jobs from automation.  For every 1 job lost to free trade  6-7 are lost to automation.,?

6478,Intel Community: ‘How can we work for a President who Undermines our work?’  Days before taking office  he compared America’s spies to Adolf Hitler’s Gestapo.  American spies do not like having their work dismissed by the president. Nor do they appreciate comparisons to Nazi Germany.  Former CIA Director John Brennan made it clear: “The person who said that should be ashamed of himself ” Brennan said.  Coats’ predecessor  Gen. James Clapper  called Trump’s comments “a terrible  insulting affront … completely inappropriate.”  Trump’s opinions are out of step with the conclusions of the agencies he is supposed to be leading.

'Essential' enough to just be there to pass out other taxpayer dollars to non-taxpaying folk?,?

6499,Core causes?  How far back in history shall we reach?  Religions as tools of social control in service to greed-ridden monsters  especially those running the global petroleum industry  seem the most likely culprits for the latest rounds of senseless violence besieging the world.  I only half jokingly suspected that bin Laden would be found in Crawford TX.   He gave the Bush League the perfect opportunity to fulfill the American petroleum biz dream of physically controlling the pipelines and oil fields of the Middle East.  But  with the typical incompetence and corruption that hallmarks corporate conservatism  they squandered the chance  choosing instead to sow insanity and infanticide in efforts to suck the public trough dry.  From time immemorial people have suffered and died at the hands of power-mad fools who cannot gather unto themselves enough  ever  of everything.  And far too many have declared their support for it in the names of gods as justification.,?

6525,What a piece of GARBAGE! Obviously written by a left wing nut that resents the knowledge  experience and power that comes with getting older. It seems that she (and many other clueless people) think that 'aging'  working your way up and being a useful part of society in your 'golden years' is something to be ashamed of.  Being 'old' and part of society is not a dirty word  it's something to be proud of. Remember lady one day you will be an 'old white woman' how you going to feel then?,?

6528,"Examples  of course  are God Bless America and Xavier Malcolm  whose posts are ten to one focused on such attacks rather than addressing issues."  You lied again. Let me repeat  you are a liar. You obviously haven't read all of my posts  because I suspect it would be 10 to 1 the other way and the one is really only attacking you because you're a liar hypocrite. And many of those aren't attacking you  they're simply disagreeing with you but you see that as an attack.,?

6532,(continued)  Anyone with a basic understanding of science can review the “best evidence” presented by fluoridation opponents (FOs) to date and see why it has been repeatedly rejected by the majority of science and health experts:  1)   The study will have nothing to do with drinking optimally fluoridated water (OFW);  2)  The study will deal with exposure to fluoride ions at far higher levels of exposure than found in OFW;   3)  Actual conclusions have been deliberately distorted/misused/misstated to fit anti-F propaganda; 4)  Conclusions will only be suggestion of a possible correlation without proper adjustment for other potential causes and they are proof of nothing;  5) The study will be unrepeatable &/or  6) the claim will be a complete fabrication.  Without conclusive evidence that fluoridation is harmful  or does not reduce dental decay which is harmful  FOs are like someone screaming FIRE in a crowded arena (causing injury/death) because they think they might have seen a flame.,?
6533,Good. Play stupid games win stupid prizes.,?
6534,Why? Because he can snake past your intellect? Why does a village school cost $7.2 mil he approved? What about the $25m police academy he ordered that they don't want? Oh he "tried" to impliment income tax? He sure did at an absurd amount that would make us the highest in the nation. He is trying to get out of the black NOW and that is NOT going to happen. Why does he want the dividend? Because our government is based on precidence. He takes $1500 per resident now  he has legal authority to take $55billion tomorrow. Keep in mind the state has had since 1977 to get off oil. Keep in mind walker has been throwing his close personal friends $250k year jobs (unneeded jobs). Keep in mind he still approves cola  per diem and housing allowance to state employees. Walker gets one penny of that pfd and i promise you...Alaska's economy will collapse. He is taking jobs  and money from the lower and middle class. Institute a 5% sales tax cap $100 on merchandise. And 5% income tax non-refundable.,?

Plus watching OZ in the interviews  he actually thinks his second chance will be the saving grace to the team. He and Joseph espousing the continual... 'practices went great  team is on point and focused  we're  ready to compete... '.  OK fine. Just stop the talk and show it on the field. OZ is not a class player when it comes to leadership. He failed and sulked when Manning came back and led the team to the Championship. He bolted to Houston for the big money. He failed there! He failed in Cleveland! Very few ever get the second chance he's getting.  Just be quiet  real quiet and win on the field!,?

Here in the good old US of A  we'd call his killers "thugs"  but we'd give them a trial  first. That's okay  JM 771. We can appoint you to be the one who decides who we kill without trial. Hmmm. From England's point of view  our Revolutionary forefathers were "thugs". The king wasn't so sentimental with all those Colonial leftists.,?
6577,Stop minimizing.  The folks doing the hacking are doing so 'not just because they like the challenge" but also because they are either paid to do so (contractors) or that this is their actual job.  This is state-sponsored hacking by the Russian government with any results being used to influence  confound and confuse their enemies.  This is no different than KGB disinformation efforts by the Soviet government during the cold war.  It relies on western media being wide open while Russia keeps tight control over information.  Control over information eventually failed during Soviet times and will likely fail here.  In the meantime  the influence and disinformation campaign will cause damage and confusion  mostly because our new digital overlords: Facebook  Google  etc... have no interest in doing the job the newspapers and journalists used to do  which was ensure what is published has some basis in truth.  As well  the public seems not to care about truth either.,?

That Quebec and Ontario are not a devil again's west but dont have oil therefore they protect their own interest? just like Albertas does whit oil?  Day's of oil era are close to end  like it or not. It will not be a Quebec decision  or Ontario or even Albertas. It's a china  California and Korea decision thsoe 3 places devellop more new technology every day at a pace that we dont even imagine. disussion east west injustice abouth a dying technologie is counterproductive and pointless.

6600,AT:  I do not use the term "weird".  I find it offensive when applied to anyone.  I have said I find your comments extreme and sometimes insulting.  I do feel your view re: abortions is very  very extreme and  therefore  it would be really impossible to have a constructive civil conversations with you on the topic.  As a matter of fact I have  on several ocassions  suggested we have a cup of coffee or a beer and discuss issues.  We see many things very differently  but that doesn't preclude a civil conversation.  However  as I mention in my response to you and based on both the content and tenor or your remarks  I feel it would be impossible to have such a conversation with you on the topic of abortion.  I responded to your post  not to promote that conversation (which I don't see as a possible conversation)  but to inform you of my feelings regarding your posts on the topic.  Hope that is clear...regards  Gary Crum,?

6611,Safe  smafe  it is about what industry has your ear.  Trump doesn't give two whits about the people.,?
6612,"sometimes  the best thing that governments can do to be helpful is simply get out of the way." - The first problem the government is creating is by railroading 200 000 new immigrants into the GTA as tax slaves.  There is no other problem. They create the problem and then dump it onto the free market of landlords  tenants and would be home owners or residences. - The difficult and painful part of this housing disaster is that people who grew up in Toronto are being pushed out of their own communities  they are literally being replaced like robots being upgrade with a more efficient and hardworking model. The government is treating Torontians like machines. These 16 points are just white wash over the real problem. - You want a free system? You want the government out of our lives? The solution is pay off the debt  fire the state employees  sell off the crown land. End the immigration ponzi scheme because it will blow up sooner or later like all ponzi schemes and we will pay for it.,?
6613,Hopefully the PUC will examine if HECO is employing good cost controls and to look at its bloated overhead and management structure.  Every organization should be constantly improving.  Rate hike requests above the inflation rate should be closely scrutinized.,?
6614,Typical conservative crap. Let's blame everyone else. The conservative lifestyle.,?
6615,Trump did say he would Obamacare with something better. Now it is very difficult to imagine any system that could be "better" in any meaningful sense of that word  if it doesn't do some combination of the following three things:  - cover move Americans - provide broader coverage - cost less per person  Given my understanding of Republican ideology  (1) anything that smacks of socialism (the only way to achieve those objectives) is anathema  and (2) any single-payer system that would remove insurance companies  with their profits and duplicated admin costs  from the system (the best way to achieve those objectives)  smart money says Trump will not deliver.  Given the sacredness of health care choice to Republicans  on that single minded principle alone  smart money has to be on Trump producing no alternative or an alternative that:  - covers fewer Americans - provides lesser coveragae - costs more per person.,?

6628,Al Franken could not vote until July.  Kennedy died in August and the Dems lost the vote then.  Therefore that makes it a month (with the Arlen Spector - who else caucused with the Dems - was it Bernie?).  In any case  it really does not matter but in the end the argument that the Dems took no action is not true.  The Dems did try to deal with it under Obama with the gang of 8 (bipartisan) and the House Republicans would not even allow it to come up for a vote.    You are true  the R's are not filibuster proof currently with 54 to 44 (with two independents).,?

6635,this guy is an idiot. I'll disclose I'm male. but my wife had continual  high levels of "morning sickness"  as did her sisters. You don't have diclectin  they're sick and miserable.  You swallow it and wait the few minutes to digest  and they're normally functioning pregnant moms. The relationship is as straight forward as having a shot of tequila and feeling the buzz in your head 5 odd minutes later. Not sure what this fellow has missed.,?

6641,So lets talk revenue streams. What percentage of SCF/ANTHC's overall income is received through Federal Tax money? You don't know? Neither do I but definitely nowhere near 100%. . How much does the upper management for SCF bring in for "speaking engagements"? You don't know? Neither do I  I just know its not free. . How much does the Nuka department bring in? You don't know? Neither do I  hard to pass judgement if you know nothing about it. . What do you know about how these incomes are determined? You don't know? I have a limited understanding about how this is done but not enough to pass judgement. . Like the Native Healthcare facilities  Apple Computers has a long term lucrative agreement from the Federal Government  take a look at Tim Cook's salary. Take a look at the salaries of OTHER CEO's and you'll see that these. . So far you've brought little more than uninformed opinion to this conversation. You have no stated credentials/knowledge to back up your judgments either.,?

6644,The huuuuge difference is that I have never posted the kind of support for bill clinton that you do for trump.  So  my question again  do you consider someone who has done the things trump has done a "good guy"?  It's sad if you don't think character matters.  But then  I guess that explains your willingness to completely overlook trump's indecencies.,?

6654,Not humor  irony  directed at the the statement: "Over the past 25 years  it can be said that the media has looked at stories more in a small  petty sort of way than in a bigger  holistic sort of view."  .  Woodward and Bernstein wrote the first of their myriad of articles about Watergate on June 18  1972.  To say that small  petty journalism commenced only 25 years ago is worthy of a rueful grin.   . For further proof I offer Roosevelt's 1944 "Fala Speech" and Nixon's "Checkers Speech" in 1952.,?

6656,jcpro  RE "Is gasoline a chemical weapon  too?"  Not sure where Spicer mentions gasoline.   But extending your logic  a butcher knife isn't a stabbing weapon. Because it's used for trimming rack of lamb.,?
6657,What a stupid post.  Have you ever carried debt and been impacted by a job loss  rising interest rates  or a health crisis in your family?  The more debt the country carries  the more vulnerable it is to geopolitical events.  The budge will not balance itself.,?

6667,Trump’s most repeated claim  uttered 44 times  was some variation of the statement that the Affordable Care Act is dying and “essentially dead.” But the Congressional Budget Office has said that the Obamacare exchanges  despite well-documented issues  are not imploding and are expected to remain stable for the foreseeable future. If anything  actions taken by the Trump administration have spawned uncertainty. Several insurance companies have cited Trump administration policy as a reason to leave insurance markets in certain states  though others have sensed opportunity and moved in to replace insurers who have left.   http://www.denverpost.com/2017/07/20/donald-trump-six-month-fact-check-tally/,?

6669,The Swastika symbol has also come to have its own more generic meaning too. as being a symbol representing intolerance and hate.   So one might spray paint it anywhere one thought that hatred and intolerance existed.   Many on the left have used it in protests against Donald Trump  as well as many other conservatives  for example.  So you are right that it is not necessarily a Nazi.   The Nazi movement is all but dead in our country.   The handful that still pursue it are generally imbeciles:  people with an extremely low IQ.   Many are drug addicts too.  Do you not remember that Nazi couple that had all of their children taken away from them by the state of New York 4 years ago?   The state proved that they were morons  and unfit parents who beat their children.   These are the kinds of stupid idiots that follow the Nazi ideology today.

This goes beyond President Trump appointing this diminutive redneck as our Attorney General. This guy is an example of a PROUD BIGOT  someone who displays his full intolerant ignorance and is absolutely proud of himself. Send him back to the rest of his inbred cousins in Alabama where they KICKED him out of office once before !!!,?

6681,The NY Times finally wakes up from its long nightmare of just regurgitating everything Trump in massive headlines throughout the campaign and election.  Times journalists  finally  perform investigative tasks tellingly absent for years in the Corporate Media.  Too little  too late as the finalization of a worldwide fascist terrorist organization descends on the entire planet led by two of the largest militay powers on earth  Russia and USA.  2 small countries  Germany and Japan led the world into war.  Imagine what can happen with what the same insane  megalomaniacal  fascist leaders can do now.  Who can stop them?  Not a cowed USA populace all too willing to follow madness whenever it washes their brains into equal madness.  Russians tortured and murdered for centuries know when to follow without dissent or pay the ultimate price.  The final solution to establish the 4th Reich begins with the agreements between Putin and Trump just like Stalin and Hitler in 1939.  History repeats.,?
6682,"I don't think that he will favour the right any more than the left."  I agree. Every indication points to Trump's priority being Trump.,?

6698,"Following Trump’s trip  Merkel says Europe can’t rely on US anymore"  Wise advice for all of the western and central European countries.  And think twice before sharing sensitive military information with the U.S.,?
6699,China weaponised its economy with the express goal of grabbing as many assets as possible overseas. Canada is just one of the easiest countries to grab assets in (Australia being another). The housing market is nothing but a bubble driven by the key element of a bubble: an unlimited supply of credit chasing a finite supply of houses.   It will have a crisis at some point. Either the high cost of housing will wreck the Canadian economy and make Canadians poorer  or  the market collapses when governments eventually take measures to stop the flow of easy credit. More likely  the government will have to drop the currency to 'ease' the market bubble.,?

6703,Oh man - what other team has ever dressed 7 to 9 rookies a night and been in playoff contention this late in the season? None! Like how stupid do you have to be to say that Babcock can't coach - ugh!,?
6704,That doesn't sound right.  If there are  that many permit out there   and if government keeps issuing permits   the prices of the permit should go down  not up.  Holders of permit also  take the risk of plummeting values if housing bubble bursts.  Holding on permits for appreciation doesn't sound right to me.,?
6705,I still am waiting to see the PM of Canada  on the ground to what is  after all a one in a century flood.,?
6706,As long as the US has a seven year old as its President  nobody gives a damn what they think anymore.  They are a pathetic joke and going downhill fast.  It's time to deal with the upcoming superpowers who matter.,?
6707,It is untrue  IMHO  that the raw popular vote is the best decider in a democracy.  Not all voters are equally educated  informed  or otherwise capable of wisely choosing the country's leaders.  Does anyone notice that the popular vote for President usually comes down to a relatively small percentage difference?  This tells me that on average people vote randomly likely out of a dearth of real information.  Also  inject the media.  Looking to the raw popular vote gives the media incredible power.  People are influenced by what they hear from the media.  Since few of us have any direct information about the candidates  everything we think is controlled by the media.  Should the media be allowed to choose our leaders?  All and all  I think the founders were pretty darn smart.  Revise their strategy with caution.,?
6708,Still using plastics and heating your home? Still using roads  and hospitals?  You can thank oil for that. I guess you prefer to use Saudi oil rather than ours?  So I can assume you are okay with funding a government that won't even allow women to drive?  Rock  you are a typical lefty hypocrite.,?
6709,I don't know about working for Trump but it's worth noting that Trump's pick for Attorney General did say that grabbing a woman by the pussy  even without her consent  did not constitute sexual assault.,?
6710,That boy is an embarrassment and unfit to be given the honor of being an officer in the United States Army.  I hope I'm wrong but I can almost envision him becoming a recipient of  fratricide in his future.,?

6712,"The models now will look simplistic in another decade."  According to the most vehement advocates  the apocalypse is already  at hand.    In another decade -- or according to some  within an even shorter period of time   without some as-yet-as-unknown action  by everyone worldwide  the human race will is inevitably on the way to its extinction.,?
6713,WWII has nothing to do with today  Rip Van Winkle.,?
6714,I couldn't care less about McDonald. He offends some people which is understandable so change the school names no big deal.   This has absolutely nothing to do with "erasing history". History is studied and taught through books  textbooks  teachers  etc. - the name of a school in no way helps teach history.   Time to accept our past and the suffering involved and move on.,?
6715,Its pathetic  we want to raise the rates for people with disabilities where were the Liberals over the last decade  its been hard to stomach the last few years since fake Christy took over clever ben's seat in West Kelowna . Cannot wait to see her flushed .,?
6716,While Donald Trump accused Clinton supporters of this crime  there is no evidence that the perpetrator supported Clinton.  In fact  the motive is unknown  except for the spray painted sign telling NAZIs to get out of town.  It could just as easily have been a Republican plot to discredit Clinton.  Unlike Trump  who encourages assault against his hecklers  Clinton has never incited her followers to riot.,?

6721,Nobody in the financial system is above the fray now  so it is hard to say what this rating shift means. But the Bank of Canada should stop wringing its hands over consumer debt and recognize that low interest rates encourage borrowing. It isn't a new principle or hard to grasp.,?
6722,i'm guessing that dogs being a passionate issue and tender spot for many   this jerk may serve hard days as he may not be well liked.  there are no built in  preventative protections in jails for aggravated animal abusers as are for sexual offender creeps.  he'll be in the general population.  he better hope that bubba's only beloved and true friend wasn't his dog and that the thought of someone beating a dog doesn't make bubba crazy....***40 days for ralston  - what a shame - what a hole in our laws.  animals deserve certain  rights like dignity  humane treatment.....,?

6724,keep drinking the kookadie loser and in the mean time explain how if canada turned off 100% of our carbon it would do NOTHING since we are a hick up of emissions when the usa  china and india are but thats ok with ignorant idiots like you who think destroying our economy to feel good but accomplish nothing for the environment is a worthy goal!   its brain wash ignorant sheep like you that live in the cult idealogy rather than critical but open minded thinking,?
6725,Half ass law: The perpetual idiots aka FLAT TIRES strike again. Passing a law that only addresses half the problem. Talking should NOT be allowed when crossing the street.

6727,I just made the comment not more than an hour ago that Trump followers are so inept and ill informed that they would follow the moronic buffoon off a cliff.,?
6728,What does that have to do with anything beyond feeding your pathetic hate of everything progressive.,?
6729,Most politicians care about their positions.  They know if they try to ban the use of oil and gas the way so many of the folks in this thread propose they would kill their local economy AND starve and freeze their voters.   The ones that would recall them in a heartbeat and repeal the idiocy they passed.   You can keep claiming nonsense all you want.,?
6730,This "monarchy"  is doomed.   This is just a lucky tribe of in bred goat fuckers who found oil under their sheep.,?
6731,Abortion is a woman's right  for whatever reason she chooses  as it should be. The state and/or Federal government has no business legislating morality either directly or indirectly.  I just love it when Big Government haters and "don't tread on me" hypocrites pass this kind of legislation.  Pathetic.,?
6732,You mean as diverse as Protestantism which adopted the vernacular 500 years ago  now we have around 40 000 varieties. Is that enough diversity  do you think?,?
6733,Nothing “rare” at all about these clowns stealing tax money.,?
6734,ignorant haters don't care about the realities  they think it's easy peasy to do all the things they say the poor should do while crying that pennies out of their pockets for assistance is terrible. totally clueless meanness and it comes real easy when they have the same toxic mindset soiling the Oval Office and holding the Congress majority.,?
6735,I haven't made it yet.,?
6736,This also clearly adds to Trump's racist  white supremacist pedigree.    Some of the people marching under NAZI flags in Charlottesville (all white) were apparently "fine people".  A part black guy  and other black guys  making what are actually a completely legal protest  albeit portrayed and communicated during the ritual of the singing of the US national anthem  is a/are SOB(s).  Trump is co-opting as well as linking the concept of Patriotism to White Supremacy.  Lot's of people do acts that openly "disrespect"  and sometimes defiile the flag (as others point out  a constitutionally protected act)   Like  for instance  the Nazis in Charlottesville (including the "fine people" amongst them) who waived swastika flags in lieu of American Flags.  Trump chose the SOB moniker for blacks.    He's a racist  White Supremacist.  No doubt about it.,?
6737,The postulates on which economy is based must be changed. There is no guarantee that  as robots and technology accomplish much of our necessary work more efficiently  that an equal number of new and equally respectful jobs will be created. In fact  it is almost obvious that the number of jobs necessary for society to function will decrease. Yet  if the robots and technology are truly capable  our society will be no less  and probably even more wealthy and productive. If this increase in wealth and free time is not being directed in some transformed form to the people  but instead hoarded by those who don't need it  then workers who lose jobs will be relegated either to work at jobs much below their intelligence and skill level or simply to die off. The postulates need to be rethought. Our society will become richer  with more free time  and the assumption that food  health care  and housing requires a proportionate income will have to change. This will be a big challenge to some.,?

6742,"Who would you rather do business with?"   Nothing stopping the UK doing business with those other countries. Germany exports to them very successfully  whilst the UK imports from them very successfully.  Leaving the EU won't change that,?
6743,You wouldn't know truth if it came up and smack you on the  butt.,?
6744,This makes no sense. Canada and Trudeau have already gotten their headlines for stepping up to the plate with compassion and virtue to take the refugees and others who are being impacted by the Trump travel ban. No one is going to find out what you're doing with the Emerson 'problem'. Enough already with looking for a technicality to save face. It's not necessary. This is similar to the theatrics of whether Canada should do the right thing and not sell billions of dollars of arms to the worst human rights violator in the world. No one found out you did that either  you get to keep the money and the  'peace loving honest broker' stuff. Along the same lines  European countries marvel at the relative ease in which Canada can bring in tens of thousands of Syrians compared to the chaos in their own countries. What they don't know is the secret seems to be to limit the influx to orphans  families and homosexuals. You would be stupid to let that info out. You've already gotten your headlines.,?

6750,Collins reacted with surprise. “I was not aware that residents had to give consent for K-9s.

You know  what are they concerned about if (the officers’) only job is to ensure there aren’t drugs in the unit?” .

6751,Douglas:  While we have nuances of differences on this issue  I think we both hope it can be "settled"  and the issues which it highlights discussed in a civil fashion.  Too often such conversations don't occur while they're still "abstract"  but  instead  only are addressed when they're "highlighted" by a specific action and  thereby  personalized.    The issues of race in our communities and the issues surrounding Freedom of Expression are far easier to addressed w/o a specific individual and his/her actions at the center of the discussion.    The same  of course  applies to discussions of personal and professional ethics and integrity.  regards   Gary,?

6755,Just the opposite. The traitor Trump has claimed the Presidency of the US using underhanded  traitorous methods. He is a racist  bigoted  misogynistic  hate-spewing member of the establishment elite. He is a liar and a charlatan and he most certainly does not represent the "common people." It is those like you who blindly accept a completely invalid "leader" with ulterior motives that are the problem. Accepting Trump demonstrates how stupid and gullible those like you are.,?

The gross profit margin of ALL our exports to the US is less than 35 Billion CAD. So you know what? GO POUND SAND.  You're nothing but a bunch of deadbeat  paranoid  white supremacists  who feel it is their 'moral obligation' to keep their society '20 Mule Team white'.   The fact that the government of the US allows the continued public display of some kind of weirdo statue (likely erected in the. middle of the night by a bunch of drunken yahoos in white hoods)  that calls for the outright murder of 7 Billion people  tells you all you need to know about the 'American mentality'.,?
6762,The trader says to sell these stocks now and buy them back when their yield is in the 4% to 6% range.   There may be just a small problem with that plan. A typical portfolio invested in these sectors likely yields 4% to 6% today.  These seniors are undoubtedly well positioned  are receiving in the area of $40 000 in dividends annually that will also likely attract little in the way of tax and they'll undoubtedly see that income rise year after year.   I'd sugest they sit back  enjoy life and watch those dividend cheques continue to grow. Who cares whether the the share prices of the companies they own rise or fall in the short term?  These seniors should not.,?
6763,Disagree - sure.  Dislike - no problem.  Calling people liars  crooks  cowards  scum - not politics  or in any sense appropriate behavior.  Please  let's not follow the despicable path shown in the US election - call out this type of crap whomever says it.  We're better than this!,?

6772,Zinke To Carve Out Exception For Home State On Shrinking Monuments  Zinke is all in with Trump's wish to sell off our public lands and parks to corporate exploitation and destruction.  Except in his home state where he's asking for more parks and more set asides of public lands.  But then again  Zinke wants to keep his home base happy so they'll support his future political endeavors.  Just another grifter and huckster.,?
6773,Thanks Poplak! I'm outa here - going to slit my throat!,?
6774,"Trump's allies have ridden to victory on the class division  and also on another long-standing American political habit: blaming endemic  complicated and unresolved social and economic problems on the current administration  and voting for change  any change." Thats how Obama got elected. How can a professor emeritus of history not know this? TRUMP HAS NOT DONE ANYTHING YET. WAIT TILL HE DOES  THEN JUDGE. It is like the liberals have fast forwarded 4 years in their own minds and then past judgement on what they imagined as fact. What does someone who gets tenure know about the common man who gets downsized and replaced based on performance.,?
6775,The special treatment is to allow Trump and Johnson to escape the deadlines that everyone else had to live be.  At the time  Trump thought he'd win and figured why bother with Alaska.  Now not so much and he is trying to stem the hemorrhaging.  Johnson was simply asleep at the switch.    Both of them had their chance and why should the rules bend for them?,?
6776,Idiotic response.,?
6777,It was about Toronto and how Toronto thinks it is more important in the world than it is.,?
6778,Far to many injustices are done by so called circumstantial evidence. Far to many hangings in the name of expedience ie. Wilbur Coffer  Louis Riel (hanged for political expediency). Life and freedom are far too important for circumstances. Lately we have released persons from jail after spending their productive years behind bars as later proven innocent.,?
6779,If you don't support Trump you should be imprisoned until you do :). ammm...maybe tortured too. lol,?

6784,How about putting back the help mental patients used to get  but with more quality. Funding these patients have been cut so dramatically  a city finding a burden on funding send them to nearby cities as if it was their neighbors problem. SMH,?
6785,It wasn't 1966.  It was 1968.  Marilyn and I tracked them down to the Westward and saw Ringo dropping silver dollars from at least 4 floors up.,?
6786,They have never said they would provide the same services for everyone  they've just said  "we welcome everyone".  Not the same thing.  In fact  they've said they will find an excuse to *not* provide wedding services for same-gender couples if asked.  That's a plan to discriminate and it shows intent.,?
6787,WTF are you ranting on about?,?
6788,Oh trust me  I very well can see - plain as daylight - that others think differently than me  that much is certain. It's interesting to me the lengths you would go to defend them: by first linking to an article and implying narcissism  then using anecdotes  nicely building into a story. I fail to be impressed that you wine & dine with the owners  but see no relevance to it with the fact of this article: that British colonialsim is very offensive to some people.,?
6789,why don't you shut the hell up  you nasty ass. how dare you treat people like this.,?
6790,Bypass is the direct delivery of palletized freight to the USPS airport hub. That allows taxpayers to subsidize the groceries  diapers  freight etc. to Alaska cities and villages.,?
6791,Ahh  holding people accountable for what comes out of their mouth.  His views and thoughts are there for the world to see.   Two pigs in the same trough.,?
6792,Sanders is hardly in a position to accomplish much of anything when he undercuts his demands with statements like this: “I will do everything in my power to make sure that no Republican gets into the White House in this election cycle.” The guy obviously never played poker.  He may have changed some the rhetoric  for the moment  but after the election it will be back to business as usual. This isn't coalition government  it's winner take all.  At the end of the day  despite their squabbling   both parties are just one big happy corporate family.,?
6793,Beautiful.  Thank you.,?
6794,Any civil servant who gets paid by Canadians should vacation in Canada  not be a snowbird  etc.  I know teachers who made every dollar of their wealth from Canadians and then they retire (for much of the year) in southern USA  buy as much as they can outside of Canada.,?

6796,Thank you for the free advice you pathetic loser......,?
6797,I'm starting to find this is all becoming rather hilarious. The Liberals have broken so many promises  one can't help but wonder what will happen next. My guess is that by the end of their mandate  Canadians will find that taxes on the middle class have actually risen.  Perhaps what Canada needs is a tax on idiots. It appears that 39% Canadians voted for this idiocy we are seeing in Ottawa.,?
6798,Perhaps his head is spinning too fast see the changes that have already been made. Ridiculous.,?
6799,The Queen is busy dealing with her tax avoidance scandal.  Time to cut ties.,?
6800,Anti radicalization starts at home and not with more government bureaucracy.,?
6801,We have differing definitions of 'ancient'.  Judge Merten  the Lane County Judge who was reversed on that appeal  is still an active Judge.    The case was decided in 2003  which is hardly 'ancient' by appellate court standards.  State v Webb.  "The relevant facts are undisputed. At the time of her commitment hearing  appellant was a 27-year-old college graduate who described herself as an anarchist and an activist in the "Stop Segregation" nudist movement. She professed to support a "truly clothing-optional world where the issue of clothing would be one of choice wherever and whenever." She was found in Eugene riding her bicycle naked in near-freezing weather.",?
6802,Google "This is why the aliens don't talk to us" images and pick your favorite. Trying to save an illegal baby's life & struck down (interesting that abortions are illegal in Mexico). Sad! Stupid girl doesn't realize the value of having her baby in the U.S....,?
6803,Ridiculous! Here's someone trying to help these people out and it's not good enough for them for now. Politics is compromise  but for these idiots that's too complicated. They're every bit as bad as the far right wing nuts who take the same stance  not compromise. Drive by these extremes and get on with it.,?
6804,It WOULD be interesting to know the percentage white males that were killed during routine traffic stops. Or the number of white men lynched in the twentieth century for that matter.,?

6808,Allie  in your haste to label somebody else's comment. You somehow missed the part where you are the biggest hypocrite when it comes to labeling.,?
6809,I am gay too so I can say you are quite fascist in your determination to eradicate the rights of others  ie  the right of the School Board to say no.  Muslims teach their child far worse about gays and what to do with them.,?
6810,Racist much!,?
6811,Trump demonstrates over and over again that he cares nothing for the people.  All are only pawns to make a point or score a "win."  In this case  he pulls funding for subsidies  causing insurers to leave certain markets  then says  "see how obamacare is imploding?"  What a nasty buffoon.   So sad and pathetic!,?
6812,Hawaii has experienced first hand the effects of banning individuals based on their nationality/religion/ethnicity  whether it be banning Hawaiian religion  practices and culture in the 1800's or interning thousands of Japanese at Honouliuli in the 1940's.  It is very fitting that we take a stand against an executive order such as this one.,?
6813,"It was 9-year-old Kevin Tighe’s dream to own a surf shop when he grew up." And all this time I assumed he wanted to be a paramedic.... I know a couple other hobbies that do this sort of thing... bush crafting for one.  Some months you really score big and other months they focus on another part of your hobby that you're not really into  so you're stuck with a box of stuff you'll never use (of course the value and quality of the goods are still high  so you're not getting ripped off).  It's normally a good deal  and it's always nice to be pleasantly surprised once a month.,?
6814,really. must be an amazing story.   that area is desolate. so many families are left not knowing - and it was skill but also small miracle that  they found her... and her scumbag boyfriend lost any power  in a plea that he may have had  without her....hope he burns in prison.,?
6815,O_G ... In 2009 the only thing the Liberals didn't like about the massive $53 billion deficit in year one of The Great Repression was that it wasn't large enough - they wanted much more stimulus spending (which lead to the deficit).  They even threatened to bring down the government if the stimulus spending wasn`t higher.  Harper promised to get the budget back to balance within 5 years and he was as good as his word.  Clearly  Trudeau 2.0 inherited Trudeau 1.0`s DNA as The Godfather of Federal Debt in CANADA.  He has already made history as the only PM to win an election promising a maximum deficit and immediately breaking his promise by 300%.  And Harper`s relative success vs the other G 7 countries was not just on the deficit but on growth  jobs  debt to GDP  reputation  etc.   Hilarious how partisans give Obama a pass for increasing the debt by over 100%  PET by almost 1000%  Justin on track for $1.5 TRILLION by 2055 but go bananas at Harper`s piddling 25%.  Nice try at deflection,?
6816,(continued)  “We should ask not are we entitled to impose fluoridation on unwilling people  but are the unwilling people entitled to impose the risks  damage & costs of the failure to fluoridate on the community at large? When we compare the freedoms at stake  the most crucial is surely the one which involves liberation from pain and disease.” – Dr. John Harris of the Department of Ethics and Social Policy at the University of Manchester  UK,?
6817,Trump Jong-un does not approve of this letter. It too will have to be made illegal. America's pussy  Trump's grabbing it.,?
6818,What if I don't accept your judgement? What happens if North America doesn't accept my judgement?  Absolutely nothing! A difference that makes no difference is not a difference. Only a very anal person would make a fuss about something so inconsequential. It appears we have two such nigglers here today.,?
6819,Plant fibers are far inferior to fur and wool.,?
6820,No I used the word civilisation on purpose. I believe that is what was meant.,?
6821,Did you misplace that reference  seth?,?
6822,No matter how slippery  oily and fawning  Scaramucci won't last even as long as Spicer did. First  he doesn't actually need the job. Second  the only loyalty Trump has is to himself  and eventually all the petty grievances and annoyances generated by even the most craven of his sycophants build up and irritate the Great One beyond bearing. Third  the smarter rats will begin leaving the SS Trumptanic soon. Whatever else he may be  Scaramucci doesn't seem stupid.,?
6823,It has much more to do with personality than with age  color  race  gender  etc. People who are timid  regardless of the above  will feel marginalized in such situations  while people who are not will tend to bully and rule. Again  regardless of age  color  race  gender  etc.,?
6824,UNC - another crybaby team to boycott.,?
6825,You are well named!! Obama bombed Syria  Obama deported thousands of illegals  Trump haven't repeal Obamacare and you are whining because you can't read?? I  wrote that UAA are bunch of hypocrites. I wrote that if that was Obama's head  UAA will not tolerate it because its a black head held by a white man. Double standard is what is right for one but wrong for another. This has nothing to do with party politics but obviously you are entrenched  you can't even see the tree in the forest.,?
6826,This is nothing but another smokescreen to take people's minds off the fact that the Trump administration is screwing up and falling apart  day by day. "Let's bash the gays!" "Put Hillary in jail!" "Jeff Sessions is weak!"  Trump definitely thinks the average American is a dimwit with an attention span shorter than a fruit fly's. I'm beginning to thing he's right.,?
6827,This moron has been a Democrat his whole life.,?
6828,IRT Carl: Your statement "Both have demonstrated a disdain for human rights and a tolerance for harsh measures in dealing with crime and terrorism" is so wrong. It seems like Dem pundits make similar statements enough times you actually begin to believe what you're saying. Trump has not shown any disdain for human rights.  Concerning harsh measures"  I can only say that he is dealing with terrorism  he's not "leading from behind". How did that work? Do you realize how many people have been murdered because of the formation of ISIS? About a half million. I'd like to see you debate and defend your premise.,?
6829,A good place to start in the search for a lawyer is Martindale-Hubbell. And of course check with respected members of your local bar for suggestions. Why would anyone start with SNAP to find a lawyer? That's pathetic.,?
6830,Thanks  LuLu. What a great friend you are to Chaz and Lily.,?
6831,I appreciate The Globe and Mail policing Bombardier...just as the CBC has taken TD Bank to task.  However  remember  The Globe and Mail is a Canadian newspaper and may want to consider being somewhat understanding of another Canadian company.  If you are intent on calling out companies engaged in improper business practices  why not widen the scope and investigate other companies (like Embraer) doing the same thing.  Remember when Airbus was handing out envelopes of cash to Canadian politicians?  I seem to recall Brian Mulroney being at the centre of that one.  Sure...run with the story  but in fairness to a fellow Canadian company trying to make it in this big bad world  why not widen the story to cover the whole picture of the fact that this type of bribery is rampant across the entire industry.,?

6833,A down arrow icon is needed to count those of us who recognize idiot commentators among us.,?
6834,The "Pit Crew" yells Suck for each visiting player  this is acceptable  but yet the University goes after a Professor for what she did in her own home.  Does the University of Oregon define "Sportsmanship" as being disrespectful  as being childish   I think before you call a "Kettle Black" (no pun or connection to the Professor situation  just the best term to use in this situation) you better look in your own backyard.  I can see this in kindergarten  but at the college level!! Once again another example of what Sports teaches.,?

6838,They can stay where they are and die or fix their their hellhole of as country. Either way I don't want them here.,?
6839,I agree that losing an asset for nothing is terrible (Stastny)BUT I am not sure Grigorenko counts as an asset. Buffalo offloaded their 'problem children' in the ROR trade and in one case it looks like patience was needed (Zadorov  once ranked as their worst 1st round pick of the last 10 years). In the case of Grigorenko  I wouldn't be surprised to see him playing next season in the KHL or another pro league across the Atlantic.   With late round picks only about 1 in 6 play at least 100 games  so while it MAY turn into a real player  it's extremely unlikely. I understand why team chemistry and one last shot at evaluating the asset are more valuable than the hockey equivalent of a scratch-off lottery ticket.,?
6840,It was updated. ...,?
6841,I'm surprised you didn't add  "Don't ya believe Government knows better than individuals on how money should be spent  Comrade?"     Do I presume correctly you're from Central Canada? It would explain much.,?

6845,Throw him in prison for murder!,?
6846,I don't have problems with the stories.  The problem that I have is that these stories are treated as factual renderings of historical fact.  I believe that treating these stories as fact strips them of their power.  I think that is also does a disservice to those who listen to them.  If the stories can be taught as allegory  then they can open new paths for all of us in our knowledge and understanding of God.,?

6850,Don't confuse "harm" (as in loss of function) with being offended.,?
6851,I'm of Scandinavian ancestry but of Saami background. Saamis were the Native Americans of Norway  marginalized even now racially. My great-grandfather and his brother escaped that by emigrating to the US about 1880 and homesteading in North Dakota. Saamis weren't slaves in Norway  nor did they own slaves. Vikings held the earliest known parliaments  the "Althings" around 1000 AD. Later they became the dominant families in parts of Europe including England and Ireland. Human slavery was widespread in Europe and in every other culture. We don't do that any more  in any nation that has the elements of modern culture.  Your post is irrelevant.,?
6852,Actually start by teaching them how to read and write and of course a course in manners wouldn't harm either.,?
6853,Thank you judge for a wise and fair decision.  So glad you are our judge.,?

6857,Homelessness is not against the law but many of those that are homeless break lots of laws and are not arrested  Why not? We need to the words "crime and punishment" connected.  Homeless is not a "get out of jail free pass".  Helping people is one thing.  Being taken advantage of is quite another.,?

6914,Trudeau's flip aloofness and lack of experience comes shinning thru yet again.  For better or for worse  the tide in trade  economics and public policy has turned in the US. That's a fact and that's how Trump got elected. Why's that so hard for the Liberal Party and the MSM to understand? Auto assembly in Canada will be on the hit list- count on it  the UAW will make sure of that.   The federal and Ontario Liberals just giving Ford $200 million to locate a mobile internet research facility in Ottawa is gonna drive them around the bend. That lab would have been in US without the hundreds of millions from Canadian taxpayers and it just serves to drive home the need for a border adjustment tax.,?
6915,"There is no evidence that increases in the minimum wage have any effect on employment and the author fails to cite the study he mentions." A student of first year Economics is taught that increases in labor costs result in a fall in total employment. Also that managers make choices between labor and capital  so when the price of one increases  money flows to the other.  When I raise these points with certain individuals they cry "propaganda". Just like when you discuss climate change with other individuals and they say the science is also "propaganda".  So you want a study? Pick up a first year Economics text book.,?
6916,I just need to say this; every automobile "accident" can be traced back to someone doing something wrong or stupid. Whether it's driving drunk  speeding  distracted by kids  phone  etc. There aren't any "accidents"  just unintended screwups.,?
6917,“I think this is the time for Canada to be loud  very loud  and that’s not always the case ” was how Ian Bremmer – who heads the global consulting firm Eurasia Group  and is a prominent foreign-policy commentator....  Well  happy days: Bremmer isn't one of the PMs inner circle nor a member of the PMO. (Every day you can find something to be glad about!)  So Canadians don't need to care WHAT he thinks  or  in this case  that he appears NOT to think.  Who EVER beat out the Donald--now the President  not just the champion of his followers--by being "loud  very loud"?  And this guy is a "a prominent foreign-policy commentator."  Appears he has a prominence elsewhere  too: stupidity.  Tip to JT: shhhhhhhhhhh....keep mouth closed.,?

6919,Bright people don't discount ideas because they're old  whether from Johnson or Voltaire or Socrates (heard of 'em?)...  The scoundrel Donny Trump was elected by the dumbest people in his country  how did that work out?,?
6920,trump is more unstable and lunatic than kim and putin.  he is the new axis of evil.,?
6921,A human society will never be an "ideal" society  in that sense--although we can certainly do better than we are at present.  And you still haven't explained what your references mean in that context.,?
6922,Nope. They don't.  Bigots are scum.     Even if they manage to get a degree in something  they are still scum.  Black.  White  Brown  doesn't matter.    BA  BS  JD  PhD  MFA.  GED.  doesn't matter.    They are still scum!,?
6923,May will likely win a landslide.  Labour Party might get above 30%  but even that will be an uphill battle  but with the Tories pretty much swallowing up all the UKIP votes from last time  that means they are in the high 40s rather than high 30s so pretty much any riding where the Conservatives + UKIP got more votes last time can be expected to flip in their favour.  If the party was smart they would dump Corbyn and try and get a more moderate leader.  The London mayor Sadiq Khan would be the one who I think they should choose.,?
6924,Yes and that is the difficulty. When lawsuits and demands for money are still happening  they can't issue an apology. it admits guilt and culpability  and since they were doing what the Canadian government asked them to  might not even be appropriate.,?
6925,Hahaha repented and drumpf in the same sentence makes me laugh. You really think that giant cheeto with cotton candy hair has an ounce of religion flowing through his body? Naw that Botox and hair chemicals cancels it all out. Conservatives crack me up man they could care less what a person running for office has blatantly done as long as they claim tidbits from the bible what is it "second" Corinthian....shit they don't even have to correctly quote it as long as they tried....E for effort with those screwy individuals.,?
6926,Funny. It was leftist thugs who attacked Trump supporters in San Jose. "GOP-created email controversy" shows how deranged Ms. Henjum is. The racist extremists are bullies like Black Lives Matter ("Pigs in a blanket  Fry'em like bacon." "What do we want?" DEAD COPS! "When do we want it? NOW") And who supports BLM? Why Mrs. Clinton of course. How many jobs has Mrs. Cinton created? Ms. Henjum is pretty close to the Social Justice Warriors at Trump rallies who  with spittle running down their chins  scream RACIST. Another other attempt at dialogue is impossible.,?
6927,So far the only person who seems to be able to rid the Catholic Church of these filthy rapists is Mother Nature. Sometimes death is such a wonderful tool.,?
6928,And I have been called a traitor to the United States to dare question or challenge its policy of regime change. Translated  you have the courage to uphold your responsibilities to your constituents  and take the heat. Tulsi you are a the brightest star Hawaii has ever had in the US congress. You surpass the revered Inoyue by leaps and bounds.,?
6929,Damn that Duterte and his nimble weaponized supercargo ships.,?
6930,"The emoluments clauses command that . . . the president put the country first and not his own personal interest first.” Donald didn't sign up for this job to put the country first  he signed up so that he could stroke his ego  fluff up his feathers  and strut around like a bigly important orange fool  while advancing his Trump brand. Believe me.,?

6933,And yet the climate-change deniers  who live in a fact-free make believe universe  will continue to insist that this is all just a big "coinkydink" because they're too dumb  uninformed  uneducated and stubborn to accept science and observe the undeniable reality that's right in front of their noses.,?

6936,Haven't heard much from her lately   have we.     OOooo Naomi...Come out  come out wherever you are!,?
6937,I agree with you Wavemaker  but there is another side to that story.  Many of these off-grid communities have had opportunity for being brought into the road system  but they were all about not wanting "strangers" having easy access to their back yard.  They fought easier access tooth and nail  having now made their bed that they must lay in.  The military railroad from Fairbanks to Nome was surveyed-in decades ago  but many of the communities along the proposed route said "No way!".  My company is interested in building it  but if the locals fight it  and maybe go as far as to bring the EPA into the fray  to preempt it? Well  I have other fish to fry.,?
6938,... everyone has reported to an idiot at some point in their careers.  Till should ask to be laid off ;),?

6940,Suck it up  liberals.  We are going to drain the swamp in Ontario  Alberta  then Ottawa.  Your time is over.,?
6941,Why? When I could keep enticing my flaming liberal California friends into moving to Denver?   Are you one of those jerks who thinks carpool lane laws don't apply to you? Perhaps you need a nice ticket!,?
6942,Muck  unfortunately you lost all credibility with me. I feel sorry for your clouded interpretation of  well  everything. You have lost reality as many have. You don't live in the real world. You have become as bad or worse than the right wingers  the left wingers have lost their way and if anything will get fixed  either people like you go away or you come toward the middle. I hope for the USA  wingers all go away...Please stop with ridiculous conspiracy and making things up. It helps no one and someone may actually believe what you say and be misguided by your nonsense.,?
6943,Darn  we have to deal with almost 3 years from Kirky's clown grinning pal. Maybe if Sheehan was the "Chair" someone would be already be wearing #1 on their badge.,?

6945,Would the next Ben Johnston please step up!    Out damn spot!  Tired apologizing yet?  We are so coddled and silly.,?
6946,Trump has lots to apologize for.  let me just list a couple:  1.  He has refused to release his tax returns even though all presidential candidates since Nixon has.  He promised that he would release them  then changed his mind.  This makes him a big fat liar.  2.  He promised health care second to none but instead backed a plan that was just plain crap.  Liar liar pants on fire....  3.  He promised that he would drain the swamp but instead has made it twice as big and 10 times as deep.  Already it is almost filled up with slime.  Way to drain the swamp Donald.,?

(The vast majority of citations—about 95%—just mention other papers.)

6954,It applies quite well to thin skinned "alt-right" brats who whine and moan about how unfair the world is to them. These same kids are crying that Facebook  a private corporation  is impinging on their "first amendment rights" and call on the tax payer funded government to REGULATE the platform. They whine that they didn't get to speak in Boston but don't own the fact they were too dumb to secure a PA system and blame the cops and the media for "shutting them down". These guys are whining little punks.,?
6955,And those are just the ones with  relatively unbiased questions.    The push-polls or "What would your opinion be if you knew that X was still beating his wife?" versions are just the most egregious of the money makers for pollsters.,?

6958,So why is it OK to break the law by coming here illegally.  I need sanctuary for robbing a bank it is the only law I broke so why should I be prosecuted.  The Law is the Law and you keep electing idiots that think they don't have to follow said law.  If you are illegal you need to go and come back legally  PERIOD.,?

6962,So I wonder how the math works out for the many people who are not buying $40000 cars? Something like a Corolla  Civic  Sentra  Focus  or Cruze sell for closer to $20000 and you can go even cheaper if you want. Even if it's only worth $2000 at the end you're looking at a depreciation of $2250 per year  not $3750 per year like with a $40000 vehicle.,?
6963,Shinning Witch. It's all about he & her damn business. Screw the Golden Nugget & the "Ghetto" place she runs. If WalMart or Freddy's allows RV to park for the convenience of shopping  why not.

6964,The amount of money that Comcast makes and they won't throw you a bone. Thanks guys.,?
6965,Trump is a vile scumbag.  With this incredible retweet of the train image you wrote about  he's now mocking the murder of a woman by a Nazi at a rally to champion the alt-right specter in the White House.  Trump is a piece of garbage who is soiling the Constitution every single day he remains in office.  His approval rating falls every day and Senators are fleeing from him like he's radioactive.  His presidency is already a flaming pile of crap.,?
6966,You should. That says a lot about you. You condone her lying  her corruption  her pay for play. Here ability to enrich her friends at your cost.  You can't even admit she's a crappy candidate - sad.,?
6967,Investigating is "not" facts. Honesty  investigating is to search for facts. It's is a fact Chemicals were released intended or not but at the same time if not intended  Assad/Putin knew of it's location within innocent people lives. They were willing to release the wmd. How could you not realized the Syrians and/or Russians didn't know the consequences. It is a "fact" the Syrian bombing released the chemicals and it doesn't matter who owned the wmd.,?

6972,Yes  its been very popular with the hotel owners! The only was this is fair is if you don;t have to pay for things you don't use. If that means the fitness room use would be too expensive because not enough people use it  you get rid of the fitness room!,?

6975,Dumb drivers,?
6976,Lets look at reality  "the canvassing board - all democrats - because it was apparent that the recount would not meet the deadline  decided to recount only a select number of ballots  believed to favor Gore. Then  the board moved the recount to a smaller room where observers would not be present to observe the recount." There is no evidence necessary to see that the entire board being democrat and making those kinds of decisions are at the very least suspect. Democrats have been making the same baseless accusations about republicans on far less evidence for years. I did not say that they would falsify voter results. I related what they did and how that was the catalyst for what happened. I also did not condone in my earlier comment any of the violence that happened. They were paid by the Bush Committee? Of course they were  just as the democrat agitators were paid by the DNC and Clinton Campaign  through an intermediary to incite violence at the Trump rallies.,?
6977,Jimmy Kimmel does not understand that while the Affordable Care Act was well intentioned it didn't live up to its name while putting money into the bank accounts of companies like United Healthcare and pharmaceutical companies. Also  its administration put money into the bank accounts of telecommunications  information technology  and financial institutions that the federal government contracts to perform its duties.  There may be a better way to make health care affordable that involves the use of competition that the government regulates to ensure no company has an unfair advantage. A better way to put more money into every ones hands is to increase opportunities for all of us to own  work or invest in businesses that provide the services and produce the goods we need. We the people should elect political leaders who will pass and enforce laws that make all this possible.,?
6978,SELLING CIVIC STADIUM WAS ALL ABOUT SAVING CIVIC STADIUM! ECA SHOULD REBUILD CIVIC STADIUM! The primary reason ECA was given the stadium was to restore the stadium! But  instead  ECA totally abandoned the stadium! ECA left Civic Stadium and the grounds totally unsecured and wide open! All the tunnel doors were wide open 24/7! Prior to and up to the fire  ECA ignored emails sent to them about the daytime and overnight characters and usage of the parking lot as a jamboree of travelers  transients  bicycles  some homeless and an array of others! The parking lot was a circus day and night! ECA had caused the opportunity for the the stadium to burn by not securing the stadium in any way! ECA received 3 million from insurance from the stadium loss. ECA should use that money and the current donations to rebuild the stadium.,?
6979,That sentence really stood out for me  as well.  Thank you for addressing it.,?
6980,That's silly. very little of modern life  which is regulated by the constitution was directly addressed by that document. What you are claiming is that religion takes precedence over any other consideration. Sort of a Christian Sharia  amirite?   So if Jews are considered as Christ killers  is it o.k. to discriminate against them? If a muslim decides to discriminate against women  it that o.k.?,?
6981,I am a moron.,?
6982,Your analogy is faulty but you're too ignorant to know it.,?
6983,This man  trump  is mentally ill.,?
6984,About this story  the only thing that can be said with any degree of certainty is that this man is jaw droppingly stupid.,?
6985,My all time favorites are still Wyoming College (spend $20K per year on something slightly more legit than an online diploma mill and live in a trailer in rural Wyoming) and the now defunct Ave Maria College (come and hear Fr. Gruner's conspiracy theories and other schimatic garbage.),?
6986,Ha ha  your failure to understand betrays you. It would have been better to not respond and show your ignorance.,?
6987,This is all so ridiculous  but pretty much who we've become as a people.  We can't just say ' he/she is great.'  We have to say 'he/she is great BUT...' and continue with idiotic  pointless negativism.  JE is an ass.  Always has been  BUT he was a great tennis player and he's an entertaining commentator.  And  like Trump  has he ever apologized for anything?  Move  on.,?
6988,Well Murkowsk you are living with your own created problems. One cannot obstruct hearings on the Supreme Court nomination and then expect other rules of decorum to be followed. None of you follow your rules. The hypocrisy of bemoaning your failed attempt to pass legislation the right way but also being part of something that is doing something the wrong way is just surreal. You got a taste of your medicine.,?

6990,This is the most disgusting part of Trudeau's immigration plan. I cannot believe a Khadr is not on a terrorist watch list.,?
6991,Let's see? Can't afford air conditioning for the schools  but we can skyrocket teacher pay? The tax fallout will be a disaster  as the light rail is  and this governor becomes a more useless idiot as each day begins!,?
6992,I think its great the the natives are pushing for this  however  what does it actually mean in the long run? it means they will be more or less equal to a state and subservient to the fed. by being equal to the state they will not have to abide by state laws as they will have the power to make their own laws and taxes on their lands. OK  great  good for them  but if they choose to walk this road then i don't believe we (the state) should continue providing support (money) to the natives. i say this because we will not be allowed to vote in their elections  we will not obtain any of the benefits from their decisions or choices. actually  i see more restrictions  for example  do you think they will allow people to hunt and fish within their new lands?   ultimately  by putting their lands in "trust"  these lands will make a state within a state. is that not a violation of the US constitution  Article IV  Sec 3?,?
6993,One thing I learned while working at a bank is that they own their vault doors. So even an old bank building would probably not have a working vault. The investment for a door is not unsubstantial.,?

6997,Thug. You and Dick have the same problem as the cpc.  So sad.  You can't stick with the current topic  you don't seem capable of concentrating on the matter in hand. You remember what that is? The dumb mess the cpc has made of the election process?,?

7000,You aren't paying attention. A good many republicans bring it up too. The man is an incompetent fool and won't last 1 term,?
7001,I didn't misinterpret.  I just wasn't nearly as subtle as you.  There are too few prison hospitals for  sexual offenders  totally separate from any regular prison  not even on the same grounds  and the inmates get group therapy  individual therapy  they are treated well. 99% of rapists can be 'cured'.  In this country (The US)  there are no prison hospitals for pedophiles  because pedophiles cannot be cured.  And there are no prison hospitals for SOs sentenced to "life without possibility of parole".  There should be (I think).  (Our whole 'justice' system is terrible -- which is why I retired 8 years early -- I couldn't be a part of it anymore.)  And I think there is no other sentence for a pedophile other than life w/o possibility of parole.  We may learn how to successfully treat pedophilia somewhere down the line.  We don't know how to do it today.  ////  I'm done.  I've said all I want to say  I will not debate this -- nothing will change my mind as to what I think and believe.,?
7002,By the way  JohnG  for what it's worth  this is the second of your comments on this particular thread presented for me to review as part of this "Civil Comments" thing while I was posting my own. I gave them both the full "good comment/civil comment" approval!,?
7003,Perhaps you can clarify where I mentioned that the school should make them read those books. Seriously  who argues against hoping kids read great literature?   Buy yeah  I think kids reading the bible is silly.,?
7004,I don't think that's so idiotic. Kaepernick does have the physical talent to be a starting QB. He has more than enough. His problem is between the ears  and that is what is keeping him off any NFL team.,?
7005,Sick bastards should be shot.,?
7006,This is the right decision.   I have no doubt that it was made as a result of political calculations  but that doesn't change the fact tolls are bad policy.  Tolls are just a tax that politicians can avoid calling a tax.  Worse  they are a particularly insidious type of tax - a user fee.  Once there are user fees on this highway  what other highways will be next?  After that  what other services will they be looking to impose user fees on?  It's easy to see why Toronto city politicians like tolls on these roads - the people they are taxing are mostly _not_ the people who get a vote in electing them.  Of course  this is one reason they should be prevented from imposing it.,?
7007,That you posted an inflammatory strawman and now are backing out of doing so.   Congrats for exposing yourself as a complete hypocrite yet again.,?
7008,Kovaleski was BUSTED in back pedaling and irresponsible journalism  and it was Serge's -back pedaling- that was rightly mocked....the appropriate response is.....falsely infer intent and base appeal to emotion. No one here will touch Serge's erroneous reporting that prompted the response. I wonder why. I can only conclude that is because the salaciousness of a false inference is more important than the truth of the matter.,?
7009,Our immigration levels aren't high at all.  I'm not sure why you think youth can't get jobs  those with marketable skills are.  I will agree that it's very difficult to obtain high paid employment without a good education or a trade certificate  however that's to be expected.,?

7021,What a disgusting little loser.  Please go away McCain.  You're disgusting.,?
7022,Published date is on the CIC website which shows the direct costs (2.4 billion to be exact which likely included transportation etc.) - I wouldn't post it if I hadn't looked it up because I am pro-immigration and pro-assisting true refugees  but I believe the numbers are too high for our economy and burdening the taxpayers will result in full scale revolt.,?

7029,Truth - how about these travellers take some personal responsibilty instead of blaming the airlines.  There were warning over the Labour day weekend that this storm was going to hit and hit hard.  There have been stories of people who flew out to the islands on Monday complaining they couldn't get back.  What were they doing getting on the plane in the first place.  I would not have listened to the agents at the resort - clearly the storm was going to hit and the safest option was to get out.,?

7035,Well they got rid on Monsef finally - about time.  Now to fix this mess.  The Liberals ran on a mandate of electoral reform.  There is no need for a referendum (if they have the balls) but there is an ABSOLUTE need for this to move forward in a non-partisan way  which means the Committees work needs to be accepted  inasmuch as they rejected Trudeau's proposed ranked ballot  in favour of proportional representation.  So proportional representation it is.  Send the Committee back to get non-partisan agreement on what form proportional representation should take and get on with it damn it!!  If people don't like the result  don't worry - they'll VOTE!,?

7040,John McDowell  not really true. The operating budget INCREASED $13 Million. The “cuts” were because there were some one-time expenditures like funding TERS/PERS that show as “cuts”. The operating budget is still flat at $8.2 Billion. The operating budget needs to be cut 25% to show we are serious before I pay taxes,?
7041,That was 15 seconds of my life the g&M owes me. Dumb article and dumb G&M for accepting it. I could just as easily write that there is a split between those who use their right hand most or their left and those with light-coloured hair and those with dark.  All very sinister  I'm sure. The article was just word salad.,?
7042,It's possible George Sanchez meant to say Trump's comments have no bearing on the case. His comment makes more sense that way.,?
7043,Racism and xenophobia are wrong  and stupid  period. I don't care what the "average working class guy" thinks. There's a reason we call them average-we are being charitable. Sure  we live in a democracy-sort of-and that means everyone gets a vote. That doesn't mean we have to start paying attention to morons.,?
7044,Thanks..glad my views have been once again validated.  What is clear from the article is that HPD does not have a clue what to do.  We need far more insightful researched accounts.

They are  terrified of losing the white privilege they claim does not exist. They are also the only demographic  in the country that is dying younger. They are killing themselves with drugs  alcohol  domestic violence  and suicides.  I would pity them if they didn't think killing black folks would solve their problems.,?
7047,So much for "inclusion".,?
7048,Very insightful of you to note that this is what the tax really is:  a disguised sales tax.  Most people are so very dumb  though  that they will never figure this out.  Everyone hates corporations  so the measure will most definitely pass in November.  So shut up and stop telling the truth.   Let the people be tricked into voting for a sales tax.   Most Oregonians are way too ignorant to be able to comprehend the consequences of this tax.,?
7049,You were inferring that the Conservatives were laughing at the death of the driver  which they weren't.,?
7050,Yes  the silent crime of child molestation so very rarely happens  compared to the number of children being killed or injured by guns. We get your anti-gun agenda.  I personally would like to see higher fines and consequences in using firearms in crimes. But comparing it to being far greater than substantially under-reported child molestation is very incorrect. If one listens  they hear far more reports of child molestations.  But you only focus and listen to as many gun incidents as you can. It's like owning a certain type of car  and all of a sudden you see lots of that particular type of car on the road. Blinders off  Ward 1.  You'll see and hear a lot more.,?
7051,unfortunately the public or should I say liberal voters are as dumb as he is.,?
7052,Every canadian who buys even one american piece of crap should be taken out and shot.,?
7053,Honestly  how he's kona hide at that size?,?
7054,boo hoo hoo. Poor ting. Mayor Caldwell is so hated.     Nice try dragging Trump into this. Too pathetic.,?
7055,Hmm  not so much "taboo " One Voice  but--as they say today--just "old school."  Many are just too concerned with other things  really  to bother to start a movement to "erase" anything from "the history books."  Besides  as one commenter infamously stated a couple of years ago..."What's a book?",?
7056,This is ridiculous. If your a gun shop and you can't figure out a way to house your firearms in a manner that keeps them out of the hands of thieves  you no longer should be allowed to have a business! Jewelry stores  drug stores  banks  cannabis shops and any other form of business with a product in demand doesn't have problems at this level. Sleep in your damn stores if you need to or run the risk of being shut down!,?
7057,Want a hint? Look at your currency. Although I am sure you Liberals will "fix" that soon too....,?
7058,She's one massive criminal!,?
7059,Your intelligence and integrity has already taken a pounding here so why are you back Allon?   If you were smart you'd "Stay Down" like in the Kids in the Hall skit.  .https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trpZOYY3YGM  Strange that Rona has been shining in the House of Commons making the Liberals look like chumps and why the failed drama teacher has the worst attendance of any PM in recent memory. His team is working overtime to find any excuse to get him out of the country so he can leave the questioning to his floundering cabinet.,?
7060,Hopefully the Austrians will be smarter than the half of Britons that voted against  Brexit  and the half of Americans that voted for Clinton.,?
7061,Any Canadian who went to fight for ISIS or any other Islamist terrorist group  and who returns to Canada  should be immediately incarcerated for a minimum of 25 years and let out only when they are guaranteed to be not a threat to any person.  It would be better  of course  if they were just wiped-out in Syria.,?
7062,Cynic Enesti     Right on the money.   Obama's presidency fooled the whole world so successfully that the "times were a changin'"  the media establishment doubled down on its illusion of change by making corporate establishment oligarch Trump president.    Clearly now it's too late for folks to realize  "the crimes they are a changin". Clearly Noam Chomski's "friendly fascism" has devolved into Trump's unfriendly fascism. But middle class folks will adjust their conscienceless narcissism to it quite nicely  as the lower classes will suffer the most abuse.,?
7063,My reference was that the "real" cultural Native Hawaiians doing business at Ward Warehouse (Native Books and Things et. al.) going stay while other not-so-much and fringe Hawaiian businesses going leave Ward Warehouse.  The literature "play on irony" that I meant is the parallel simile to history where Native Hawaiians had no choice other than to "make Hawaii their last stand" during colonial Hawaii  through the Republic  and post Annexation  because they had no homeland elsewhere.  At Ward Warehouse  the Native Hawaiians  in collaboration with the "colonial" Hughes Corp interests  went hanai Ward Warehouse as its "homeland" for making its "last stand" in the commercial RE-development venue.  Here  there are ironies within ironies!   My comment was really nothing to do with Hawaiians having homes somewhere else in or outside of Hawaii.  Sorry for the confusion over my abbreviated comment.,?
7064,The majestic walls of Ontario’s legislature are hung with portraits of the province’s political grandees  and it’s hard not to notice a certain similarity among them  chiefly in skin tone (pinkish)  hair colour (grey to white) and chromosomal composition (that would be XY). This similarity does not escape the attention of a group of young women passing through the halls.  ---  Don’t let the trolls win.  So the feminist troll author  is extolling the virtues of ignoring other trolls.  The irony is thick and rich and oh so hypocritical.,?
7065,wow you are a nut job of stupid! carbon taxes are doing real damage to economies and jobs bud   why should  a business pay the wages the market can bare so they can remain afloat is the correct question commy bud   and forcing 15 an hour is just that  communist stupidity that will kill jobs   and its started everywhere its being imposed as say your god place California where in LA they forced it and guess what happened  Wallmart shut the doors putting all those people it was suppose to help  OUT OF WORK!!,?
7066,Well  actually  that might have been a little unfair  the fellow travelers and useful idiots don't really know that they're communists.,?
7067,Funny  to listen to Poor Paul bitch about people bitching when for decades all he has done is bitch.,?
7068,Have any evidence to back that up?,?
7069,The GOP had 7 years to plan.   Drafted a bill no one likes.   Debated it for 17 days  during which Trump took 3 vacations.    Great job everyone!,?
7070,That's two airlines I wont fly now; United and Delta. The CEO of the company is absolutely wrong for not taking responsibility. Sure they were legally correct  but they were wrong in every other way for a number of reasons. First of all  they should not have boarded everyone if they new they were "overbooked" (this is a whole different issue). The problem could have and should have been resolved with no one on the plane. Had they done that in the first place  the incident never would have happened. As for the "overbooking"  they need to be a lot clearer on what they mean. Did the four United employees need to get to a destination that was short staffed for a flight  or were they just going home? If it was critical that these employees get on the flight  and they asked their customers before getting on the plane  I am pretty sure they would have gotten volunteers. They also didn't offer the maximum that they are allowed to offer. Instead  they chose to impose their will.,?
7071,all you post is alt left wing ignorant opinions  no facts   who are you to judge anyone lunatic?,?
7072,...because that corridor isn't busy and congested enough...  why don't they fix coburg road first.  it's a bottleneck and probably should have another lane.  we should stop building buildings and take care of our infrastructure.  soon  we'll be tearing into some of these buildings to take room for more road.  the town is strangling in many places as it is and the projections for growth are significant with 213 000 people projected for 2031 ... a .9% rate of growth (www.eugene-or.gov/documentcenter/home/view/1772)   tearing into existing structures is so radical...we should be focused on the foundation of out community and start being proactive instead of reactive.,?

7075,That Dunleavy stands out as an irresponsible legislator and panderer in this sea of irresponsible legislators and panderers is remarkable. I think he sees a run for governor in his future as the man who tried to save your PFD. His behavior here is beyond truly disgusting.,?
7076,"In surveying premiers’ approval ratings  the Angus Reid Institute polled 5 404 Canadians  including 804 Ontario residents." Wait  what??? Only 15% of respondents were Ontario residents? What kind of research is that where the rest of Canada knows more about a premier performance than residents of her own province... Either this research is crap or The Globe didn't double check what they wrote...,?
7077,Ridiculous comment  as per usual from you.  I don't care if they have pensions  but fund it themselves!,?
7078,Cue the Trumpnuts:  Why can't you listen to what's in Trumps heart instead of relying on what he says?  The CBO didn't say that; ADN is reporting fake news. Trump is going lower our taxes  give us all high paying jobs  provide the best healthcare plan ever and lower - not raise - the deficit! Why can't the CBC  all those economists and other sore losers just shut up and accept that Trump is a genius; just a regular ole' "every man" like all of us blue collar workers. Stupid libs.,?
7079,When I read these articles  I am sometimes reminded of an old high school friend.  He ran his credit cards to the max and kept making just the minimum payments.  Well  one day he decided to move  and didn't bother telling the landlord.  Figured the landlord would just keep the security deposit.  I'm guessing the landlord had other ideas.  And when my old friend's lenders had other ideas when they found out my old friend skipped out without paying the rent.  Next thing I know  this friend is on the phone looking for friends to lend him some money.  Last time I talked to him  he told me how his paycheque went to the trustee  and he got what was left over after the bills were paid.,?

7081,The US Constitution permits Presidents to be impeached for being stupid.. ........................ but the Republican congress will never vote for that. . That's the #1 requirement for being a Republican.,?
7082,Three points:  (1) The special property levy needs to be set up not to punish Canadians who reside and pay income tax elsewhere in Canada  who then move to BC  buy a permanent residence  and become tax filers in BC. Otherwise  we have a barrier to Canadians moving within Canada itself.   (2) How much vacation property in BC is owned by Canadians working and filing income tax elsewhere in Canada? Should there be a concern here?  (3) Toronto is also close to the bottom of the heap like Vancouver for mean and median household income in Canada and has average housing prices completely out of whack with those incomes.,?
7083,A march to protest the results of a democratic election when no one marched one foot to support the enslaved sex slaves in all of your cities. You all hide until you can make some public spectacle and then come out in a shameful show of support for stupid. Children stolen and forced into the american sex trade look at you all and say...go away..we do not need your pathetic war against one man  we needed you to get your husbands away from us...meanwhile you all smile while your men are sexing babies. Your history will never change you let men buy and sell children for sex and do nothing  but a man who gets elected legitamately brings you all out. the holocaust of children and babies is of no interest to you all and your sons online  you should have to sit in on their red rooms.,?

7085,Serious.  Must place traps all over place for a minimum of 2 years.  Cannot have a single snake  much less a Boa loose anywhere on Kauai.  And  amend the law that it will be a life sentence if convicted in bringing a snake into Hawaii.  Sentence fitting the crime.,?
7086,Reading the apologies for Trump written by his sycophants on here is really sad.  Our President is a Nazi sympathizer  who cannot tell the difference between Nazis and people who gather to protest against Nazis.  Thankfully. very few adults are that stupid.    Those of you who voted for Trump should enjoy his administration while it lasts - which probably (and hopefully) won't be for long.  Trump's personality defects  ignorance  and breathtaking incompetence is causing his presidency to disappear right before your eyes.,?
7087,Maybe it was the laser beams gleaming from Donald Trump's eyes.,?
7088,Everyone who is rescued should pay for the rescue. Including water rescue. You get charge for the ambulance and should pay for all the rest... Not fair to all the tax payers.,?
7089,It's not "unelected" if it came to power in 2015 with a majority of seats. The UK elects a party  not a Prime Minister.  I've given you past examples of where PMs have changed during Parliaments without calls for an election. The people who bring up the claim that a government is "unelected" are usually  those who oppose the party in power.,?
7090,"She said the case is not believed to be linked to alcohol or drug consumption."  Sounds as if stupidity and bad judgement were however.,?
7091,Seems that being a former journalist (or the daughter of one)  can put you to the head of the line for a juicy appointment to the Senate or some other government agency. This creates an incentive for journalists not to step on any toes that might bring disfavour upon them from the powers that be. It seems that politicians don't need to fear journalists as much as journalists need to fear politicians.,?
7092,Another week another bitchy rant about freebies. Wahhhh,?
7093,Unlike Obama  he needs weak-kneed Republicans in the Senate to stand-up and repeal the stupid law all the Democrat lemmings in the Senate foisted upon us.  They should just all go home and let Obamacare continue its implosion.,?
7094,These addicts let them go.  If they are stupid enough for the first time to take strange pills with fentanyl or injection crap into their bodies then that is their decision.  If it kills them  well that was their decision.  Stupid is will have the stupid result.  Why should the rest of normal society have to bend over and support these low life people?   We can use our resources in health care to help people or normal society in need!,?
7095,That whenever one tries to generalize about groups of people  one might be accused of stereotyping.  He could also be accused of stereotyping in saying that black people are wasting their money in strip clubs.  While there are complaints about the line being perceived as perpetuation of an ancient stereotype  it's also clear that Jay-Z's thesis is that to overcome oppression  black people should emulate Jews in America by accumulating inter-generational wealth.  Whether you buy the capitalism as cure thesis or not  it's clear his intent is not to put people down  but to build them up.  My two cents:  MLK didn't dream that his children would not be judged by the color of their skin but by the contents of their bank accounts.,?
7096,Squiggs>  How do you know that they have the "moral standards."  To me they were just a bunch of crooks  anyways.   And how do you know that Trump is a bigot???  Where's your verifiable proof.  No more verifiable proof?  Then shut your first amendment a--hole.,?
7097,Since the Law School "Problem" was exacerbated by the guy who is till the President of the University of Oregon  a new Dean at the Law School does not necessarily 'solve' the problem.,?

7101,Who is  putting Canada first?  Gerald Butts? No.  Trudeau? Hardly.  Trudeau regularly  says things  more dumb than helpful.    He would  sacrifice Canadian jobs and prosperity because he is too stupid to think first and speak last.  He doesn't understand negotiations. We can only hope the faceless bureaucrats do.,?

7105,No one actually likes fascism. Running around screaming how much you hate fascism and racism  shows you have some personal deep-rooted issues you should probably work out on your own time. Being a loud-mouth about that shit is just stupid. 90% of the western world fought fascism and Nazism just 70 years ago for a heavy price. Black-Bloc/ANTIFA morons are just frustrated youth looking for an enemy to justify their anger towards a system they can't actually affect for change.,?
7106,how stupid are the ignorant justin sheep who forgot how great harper was keeping our country in the good and better than all others after the crash   the deficits he had were in in agreement with the liberals in the minority years but once in majority started working them down to balanced books without raising taxes and slashing transfers as the liberals always love to do making harper on of the BEST pm's Canada has ever had!!!.. but as usual now  harper debt bad  liberal debt good proving once again the hypocrite lib trolls here are as stupid as they are corrupt and full of bs,?

7109,.  The man/Trump is an idiot of mammoth/biblical proportions.  If the US is not happy with the other NATO nations  get the F out. Nobody in their right mind is willing to destroy their economy/fiscal reality as the United States has done to finance the industrial military complex. Put it this way; Russia is a nation of some 150 million people  a 2.5 trillion dollar economy and a military budget of 30 billion per year. On the other side of the equation;  NATO  population of 700 million +  gdp of close to 40 trillion dollars  military budget of 1.5 TRILLION dollars and the idiot/Trump wants us/Canada and Germany to spend more? WHY? So we can invade Russia? Defend Europe from Russia?   Moron  we can do that NOW  and do it with our eyes closed...................  .,?
7110,John Kerry has always been an incompetent fool. He let his daughter marry a Muslim  then brokered the sweetheart anti-American nuclear deal for Iran  effectively treason. He never did anything good for the country  and was branded an incompetent coward even in Viet Nam. He was a perfect moron's puppet as Sec of State  and should be left in disgrace. His opinion is never needed.,?

7118,"Skywest was self-insured and dialysis treatments could cost up to $100 000 a year."  Glad he won the lawsuit.

7130,All commentators here who argue against an increase to the minimum wage  I have a few questions. Can you survive on $15 per hour? Have you foregone your annual wage increase?

7138,Obama didn't bug anything  either did any other sitting president before him.

What a joke the man is and he's suckered in his base who are just as pathetic as him.,?

7149,"That Obama supported the murders of cops is mind-numbing." What a stupid  ignorant  disgusting thing to say. Show me ANYTHING from ANY reliable source that backs up this claim.  Your aim is not to share a different opinion or point of view based on fact  you're spreading mean spirited lies and rumors designed to satisfy some internal urge of yours to bring down this great country of ours. I'd ask if you care about this country or have any shame  but what's the point? If you did you wouldn't be posting your prejudice and poison to begin with.,?
7150,I haven't see gun control advocates propose anything that would have prevented any of the mass shootings  including the one in Las Vegas. What I've noticed is their ongoing willingness to politicize tragic events that there is no legislative cure for  all in the interest of furthering their long term agenda to disarm law-abiding civilians.,?
7151,Maybe GCI should have spent that money on their "system" for cell phone contracts?  Currently  the GCI "system" doesn't let them know when your current contract expires so they can drop your phone bill the $30 per month it is charged for having a cell on contract .  It appears you need to call them to let the "system" know  so they can make a "manual" change to your bill.  Funny how the "system" always seem to know when my contract is coming up for renewal  because I start getting those "new phone" calls.   Then again  perhaps this is where Ron Duncan gets his mad money for pet projects.,?
7152,Why are you referencing a HS program when the article is on 2 college programs? Your negative ignorant comments should be kept to yourself as you insult the fine student athletes at KHS. Fyi  Kalani has fielded competitive football teams for the past 5 yrs. They are not blown out and are in almost every game to the end. KHS may not lead their division but they are usually close to the division playoffs at year end.,?

7157,I hope and pray the police officer makes a full and speedy recovery! Maybe this incidence will prompt the City to throw every resource they have on fighting crime! Not a day goes by that we don't hear stories on the news and from family and friends about banks/convenience store robberies  home invasions and theft. It's effecting each and everyone of us on a daily basis...,?

7164,The Zuptas are desperate and will do anything to paint Gordhan black. Its too late Zuma as the genie is out of the bottle and you cannot put it back. We all know that Zuma is the architect of all this corruption as the Guptas are powerless without Zuma. In a way  the Guptas are the fall guys for Zuma as JZ is very good at blaming others for his transgressions. Zuma has made the Guptas multi billionaires and for that they must be forever grateful. I hope that this is another nail in the coffin of the ANC and that that are set for a massive fall - soon. The fact that so many people support such a corrupt 'government' is mind blowing. The Guptas jet must be ready for take off to Dubai in the near future. The Zuptas have ruined a once prosperous future for all South Africans.,?

7166,Beltrami says state employees have already sacrificed but I cannot think of a single instance of that.  Rep. Stutes talks about what state employees have already given up but mentions nothing that has been given up.  Delta Airlines just announced it has changed its mind and will not fly into Juneau this winter as public employees refused to fly with them; that is because state and municipal employees accumulate and hoard Alaska Airline miles.  One small department owned 1 million miles no one would use because using those miles prevented the flyer from accumulating his own miles.  What have state employees sacrificed so far?,?

7176,I bought an antibarking device from this website and it worked like a charm on my neighbors dog. It is a CD that you put into your cd player and it works with ultrasonic sound that humans cant hear.  I blasted that damn dog and he shut up.  The website is http://antibarkingdevice.com  -  We NEED this law.  People are irresponsible.,?

7179,We  don't know that it  was  swept under the carpet.   Craig  would like us to think so  but   Sarah Stokey  says  no   she's  been  made whole  the ITC  is with her    stay the  F out  of  the  discussion  as  she asked .      Sarah was   there  not   Craig   and  not  you  or  I  or  anyone  else.  Crap  like that  happens   umpteen times  a day   in Nome   Fairbanks   Anchorage   Juneau  and  every other  town  city  village  in or out  of   Alaska.       Yes  it  is often  due to  substance  abuse   which  could be  anything    from   homebrew    to    legally purchased  alcohol   or  further  into  illegal  drugs.    The  fact  that  it is  Nulato  and during  the Iditarod   doesn't  change the  fact  that  this  sort  of  crap  behavior   also  occurs   everywhere  humans   choose to  be stupid.  The  thousand  miles  between   Anchorage and  Nome  are  safer  than  staying  11  days in Anchorage.,?
7180,In your crap-filled mind  Mr. 'rank'   you cannot process 'simple' or 'common sense' etc. Your mind is filled with 'higher education' sewage and filth. Feel for ya  dude. Still hope that you can clean out the crap and benefit our great country.,?
7181,"When you try and claw back too much money from the rich ..." Are you serious? The top 10 per cent of Canadians saw their median net worth grow by 42 per cent between 2005 and 2012. (StatsCan) Meanwhile  the bottom 10 per cent of Canadians saw their median net worth shrink by 150 per cent.  That is clawing too much money back? This government is trying to close some of the loopholes the rich use in order to avoid paying their fair share.  It's long overdue. Maybe you like paying for what they do not contribute -- I don't.,?
7182,Thanks for your reply. Hoping this lasts longer  but wonder if the fanboys are over-reacting to critiques already.  Hard to be impressed with this team so far  and have to hope that the other-worldly success and good health of the starters can repeat. Otherwise the bullpen flaws and the diminished offence may cause a long-term struggle for 2017.  P.S. I was rather proud of my batting glove comment. Too clever?,?

7184,These people WANT to be arrested.  They are trying to file refugee claims  so they need to be processed to make that happen. Most actually go LOOKING for the police when they arrive.

7186,I can't speak for Chuck  but I can speak for myself as to why I hate Donald Trump. He is a liar  a manipulator  an incompetent. He is corrupt to the core. He is the ultimate entitled SOB  born with a silver spoon in his mouth and no empathy in his heart. He is everything that is wrong with America.  Unfortunately  hate is out of fashion among my fellow liberals.,?

7189,Even crackheads like Rob Ford get more respect than these career politicians and their fake news promoters.

The Politico article is primarily concerned with the rhetoric of Democratic Party leaders toward Bannon  not whether Bannon is a white nationalist. Mercifully Bannon's star is falling  but it is mind-boggling he was ever installed at the White House  much less the NSC! Incriminating evidence against Bannon was there for all to see BEFORE the election. La la la la la.,?
7192,And wherever they take up residence the crime rate soars and lack of basic sanitation leads to piles of...well  you now what.  I think the do-gooder mayor and council members in King county  who are planning this ridiculous endeavor  should be forced to house as many drug addicts in their own homes as they can fit  before allowing a single safe injection site to open.  Let them shoot up in Murray's bathroom  then we'll see how excited he is about it.  What a civil and criminal liability issue they would create for their county.

Trump campaign message: “Let’s build a wall to keep out the bad guys.” To a fourth-grader  this makes a lot of sense. But to anyone beyond the fourth-grade level who thinks just a step or two beneath the surface  building a massive wall on the Mexican border is utterly ridiculous. “Let’s ban all Muslims from entering America.” To a fourth-grader  this may make sense.  But anyone with a fully-formed adult brain knows that this proposal is preposterous and much worse. Examples of Trump’s childish simplicities go on and on.  Trump is  a known racist and I have friends out in the rural villages who would vote for him.,?

The circle that formed after the scheduled hour-long event may have only contained 29 individuals  but I personally counted 43 participants during the event. Some participants left at 6 p.m.  & others chose not to join the circle in the photo. I don't comprehend why the PDN chooses to deliberately mislead its readership  but I have a hypothesis or two.,?

7218,Yet another felon who will be unable to vote until he is at least 87 years old.  How sad for him.    Of course  Cynthia Corey will never get to vote again  but he is the 'victim' in the view of the Give The Felons the Vote crowd  not the person he murdered.,?

7225,Your premise that one will sell their assets is a false one.  I'm trying to preserve our family homestead and farm.  The only way I can do that  since farming earns precious little money and I'm against cashing out and developing as you seem inclined to support  is if estate taxes are eliminated.  But who needs family farms anyway?  Lets go with the large corporate farms that don't may estate taxes.  You love their GMOs  ya?    Frickin' taker-losers!,?
7226,Adding more teams is not the answer. There has to be a hidden agenda here because the chances of one of the additional 4 teams based on RPI rankings winning a state Championship would be less than .001%. it makes absolutely no sense for tax payers of the local schools to fund the everyone wins a trophy mentality.,?

You see  the louder you squeal  the further off the cliff you go and the more out of control stupid assed excuses you throw out  the more I smile and revel in the Great Donald Trump victory. You can piss and moan all you like about electoral vs popular (you guys said you had an electoral wall that could not be busted through so you would win anyway) You can pan the demonstrations all you want  (note  they are all in liberal cities so they are talking to themselves) and you can continue to blow all those hateful words out of your arse but realize  they aren't sticking. Yes Bob  you and your partners in lib can keep yell  cry and scream til hell freezes over....it just makes me smile all the more.  And when it gets to be just too much  get a cupcake and go to your safe place and shelter in  yep  place.,?
7239,I always very much like and look forward to your ideas about evolving theology.  That said  there is something aesthetically grinding about "hir".  Are you sure God objects to being identified as male?  After all  She has put up with it for 3000 years.,?

7245,Th history of the project has never been clear. Rail was a gift fro the previous administration. It was presented as a "good deal" for Hawaii  as the Feds would be paying a large percentage of the cost  sort of like "your insurance premiums will save the average family $ 2500.00 per year  you can keep your doctor and plan  etc." We all know how that is working out. If rail is ever completed  it will be interesting to learn of its new name. I'm sure they'll ask for suggestions from the public  then "select" one of the names. Right.,?

7270,My questions and biggest regrets about what happened on 9/11/2001 are   1) When are we going to get around to holding the parties responsible for all the blood shed and loss of life on 9/11?  2) When are we going to finally call BS on the official narrative that absolutely could not have taken place without changing the laws of physics? 3) When are we going to finally examine Israel's role in all of this and determine that they were the perpetrators of this heinous crime.   We owe it out of respect for the rule of law  We owe it to those who lost their lives and We owe it to the people responsible for taking those lives  and guess what? THE MUSLIMS DIDN'T DO IT STUPID!,?
7271,'....if you like your doctor...' is just one more ridiculous way to whine and bellyache 'Benghazi!'   People like you make me sick.  President Obama is not the person who would ram anything through.  Get the hell over the doctor thing  grow up and actually learn about the good this ACA has done for so many people in our country.  It was NOT about him  as told to you by the idiot talking conservative heads and Faux News.  Please stop being so ignorant.,?

7275,It was such a special occasion the Trumpkins dusted off Kellyanne Conway and Jason Miller. And there they were every 30 minutes or so spreading their 'insights' like a fungus you can't get rid of. Donald Trump is the face of Republican hypocrisy and  idiocy. He is a sputtering  narcissistic megalomaniac and a very real threat to US democracy.,?
7276,Seriously  loser? I was simply pointing out that you used "udder" when you should have used utter. My mom died of brain cancer - I took care of her for the last 3 months of her life. I'm guessing that's a malady you won't have to worry about. No brain - no brain cancer. You truly suck.,?

7280,Paul Ryan is right ! ...................... Republicans deserve pity.  What a pathetic bunch.,?
7281,Not quite so unheard of.  You might have gathered from my handle that I'm not a millennial  and I did it.  I do agree that 5 or more years is a long investment  and that there are more efficient ways to impart general knowledge as well as marketable skills.    Given the current state of our post-secondary institutions  I'm still recommending that my kids do it  though.  (Unless they develop a penchant for engineering or something).  College is a bargain when compared to university and most programs have a co-op option which allows them to make a bit of cash while they learn -- as well as a foot in the door for their chosen profession.,?
7282,CTV knew the rules would be different in 2017. Why did they still go ahead with a similar contract with the NFL? CDN subscribers do not have to be subjected to CTV's error of judgement. Who watches CTV at any rate?,?

7285,Pretty sure you missed the mark on this one. The real reason for this far left swing in the seat of social ideology is the far right swing that preceded and continues to parallel it in the structures of government  corporate and  societal power. Had the original reasonable calls for inclusion  non-discrimination and equality been embraced we would have all been better off and never reached this point of now-instituionalized flash points.,?
7286,I started laughing once I hit the last paragraph. And the mayor talking proudly of this new development  how it's 'been too long and we need to have a vibrant  growing downtown....'.  Seriously? You're building condos on silt  an unstable base at best. While it has a nice view of the inlet  at low tide it's the mudflats you get to look at. And they START at $400K ??? That's... affordable? For who? This will help downtown... how? The Gov is squalling 'we're broke' every day  the legislature's screeching that the Oilies will fire every highly-paid worker if we don't roll over  state-sponsored economists are predicting Alaska's economy will crater if we don't RAID the Permanent Fund NOW to feed the great  grunting pig our state government has become  we're on-course (supposedly) for a 3 year recession... who is gonna buy 400K condo's?  Oh  right. Our 'representatives' will  after quadruple-dipping Fat Federal Per Diem  Pay Raises  Furniture Budgets  and Special Session Pay.  Silly me.,?

7293,Eric  allow me to provide insight: The stop rail folks had taken the lead on trying to get the item on the ballot. When that ran into trouble  then-Council member Djou stepped in to make sure that the question was on the ballot for Honolulu folks to vote on. When the vote came down  and it went for building the system 53% to 47%  I remember him specifically saying at a full Council meeting right after that the people have spoken  and now it was their responsibility to build the system right.   To me  yes  he did pivot at that point and started working on the language of the said bill you cite. However  and I know it's shocking that I am defending him here  I can see why he wrote the bill....if your going to "try" to make the project right  you cannot do that by being a bystander continually yelling at the top of your voice that the sky is falling.   Also  at the end  the mis-management of the project had nothing to do with the bill he wrote  From my perspective.,?
7294,I seem to recall that Chretien cost the taxpayers $20 million going after Mulroney.  Liberals have very selective memories.,?
7295,... all the thumbs down on my post are Republican swine...   I thought you losers want JOBS!!!  WTF... you guys are complete FUBAR.  You are cra cra ... Amazon wants to bring 50k jobs here plus a sh!t ton of support work ... "I hate traffic" is the BEST you can come up with ...   GROW UP!!,?
7296,A child not being able to eat and forced to sit at a desk and keep composure all day is pretty hard.  People wonder why did this child go this way or do that  well it's because nobody gave a damn about him as a kid. So many ignorant assholes,?
7297,YES  THE LIGHT IS STARTING TO TURN ON ABOUT THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS THESE CHEMICAL CORPORATIONS NOW ON OUR FARM LANDS ARE HAVING ON US AND OUR AINA.,?
7298,Delusional drama queen much? The French learned from our mistake. I dare say  many countries that actually value democratic principles learned from the Orange Taint idiotic Trump Bunnies voted to put in the White House  at the urging of Putin  Assange and the other right wing nuts.,?
7299,I certainly believe the RG ought to have published more clear information about the location where this event occurred! There was no mention of the fact that this derailment was adjacent to the Northwest Expressway and Chambers Connector and two homeless safe spots as well as the nearby River Road neighborhood. Mentioning Roosevelt  Garfield  and west Eugene did not reveal our proximity to the potential for disaster that this and future derailments could have on our neighborhood. Knowing they can and do run trains through here with even more cars loaded with hazardous cargo like the  June 3 oil train that derailed and exploded near Mosier on the Columbia  I realized with horror the proximity of the danger only while riding across the Connector this afternoon!  44°03'49.9"N 123°07'12.1"W,?
7300,Comey should end up in prison for election tampering  Lynch too.,?
7301,HOMER please post something. Everyone is getting tired of you disagreeing yet not voicing your opinion  you coward! Time for you to come out of the closet homer! LOL,?
7302,Arrogant gringos garbachos stole Alaska from Mexico!,?
7303,TRump and his goon  Poisonous Pruitt  drink purified water and breathe purified air while they count their dirty money so do you think they give a fiddlers damn about those of us who are getting sick from pollution?,?
7304,Well  thank you Paxima for your most reasonable view of theology. In my spiritual experiences  it really does matter little in the beginning of our quest for the spiritual truth.   However  in the end  we need to surrender our very being  our knowledge  our memory  our thoughts to God to be united to God.  If you have a rag that will be thrown at the end of cleaning  we don't try to wash and breach it to the extreme.    It perhaps better that we stretch out our hands to God to be picked up like a little child as St. Therese of Lisieux said.,?
7305,These union as---oles don't care about the animals -why are they unionized anyways....th job requires zero educaton  much like most public jobs - the animals are muchsmarterthan these 400 morons,?
7306,I will point out if you are out of the country for more than 183 days in a year  you will no longer qualify for OAS in that year.  You will also no longer qualify for provincial medical for the year. (Provincial medical you can’t be out of the province for more than 183 days in a year),?
7307,"Just one spill near the tribe's reservation could release thousands of barrels of crude oil contaminating the tribe's drinking water" FALSE! The pipeline has spent millions to relocate the intake pipe for the reservation way upstream from where the oil pipeline will be buried crossing the river  which is NOT on tribal land  but owned by the State and Federal Government. I like Tulsi too  but this time she is chosing the wrong side  and her facts are incorrect.  She will end up looking silly.,?
7308,Sucking in.,?
7309,Yay for a good farm store. I hate that hoity-toity Co-op. They think their crap is gold plated.,?
7310,No doubt Spicer will roll out the microwave oven used to spy on Trump.  Good thing it wasn't also a convection oven.  Those things can be turned into a death ray.,?
7311,No need for research with trump. Just make crap up and sheeple follow.,?
7312,Stupidity is not a crime.  President Trump  you are free to go.,?
7313,"Selling to Trump" as the columnist concludes---is putting it rather simplistically --This  is the time for much more nimble diplomacy and avoidance of what would be surely perceived as personal insults. Don't forget the saying ---flattery will get you far---seems to work with some "actors" on the geo political arena.   Was it not Pierre Elliot Trudeau who said that we are like a mouse sleeping next to elephant. At least the moves of the past elephants were predictable.  Much is at stake. This is the time to emphasize our values at every opportunity--Tolerance  humanity  open arms---- minds and hearts at home and abroad to those in distress ----This is consistent with our national interest and "Canada First" approach.  Lead by example. Avoid the personal insults.,?
7314,I'm getting really tired of getting sucked into clicking on links to worthless  offensively stupid opinions like this one that are mislabelled news on the portal pages. Deception is the ONLY way I would wind up looking at the opinions of anyone paid to write here.,?
7315,Nope.  You want the tail to wag the dog!    The U of O "dog" could actually survive without the State of Oregon "tail".    The recent grant a couple of years ago by the Oregon Legislature to the U of O for its own Board of Directors with its own independent spending authority recognizes that fact.,?
7316,Calling the Donald insane might be a bit much.  I think Pence might be more insane as he believes the crap he says and like modern traditional republicans love to wrap themselves in God.,?

7319,Unfortunately  those mushers and the fans of the race love it so much theres not too much we can do. Dog lives matter!!! All the mushers care about is money. When i was 15  my (then) bf's family did mushing and i thought it was stupid then and always will.,?
7320,The world has already globalized.NAFTA is not that important anymore. The world wants what Canada has got.US can go suck eggs in the corner until it learns not to elect an authoritarian moron as its leader. The ninety five percent of the world not American will do just fine without them.,?
7321,Really? Who else would ignore 97% of scientists on subject? That is willful ignorance. They don't and/or won't understand climate change. They're ignorance is going to kill us all. Including an ignorant president who thinks cc is a Chinese conspiracy.  Talk about arrogance. (and stupidity).,?
7322,There is one indisputable fact about unions  which cannot be explained away. Since they have declined in this country  so also have wages and benefits. Negotiating as equals with an employer cannot be successfully accomplished one employee to one corporation. The disaffected minority who place their trust in demagoguery should take note.,?

Terry McAuliffe confirms THREE dead from Charlottesville hit and run 4:22 PM - Aug 12  2017  Now THERE is some REAL reporting.  You were able to use the "deflection" term here  while deriding actual equivalency with your comment. Classic DP comment has been made by you. ZZZZZZZZ. By the way  couldn't you find some way to insert the term "sustainability" into your comment? Classic Lefty nonsense. Silly opinion.,?

7331,LOL.  What hole am I digging?   This is the type of male bashing that the feminazis love.   To them  all men should be disposed of in the nearest open pit.  Maybe men should try one of women's favorite tactics.   NO MORE SEX until false accusations stop.,?
7332,I disagree that death is too good for the likes of Roof.  He needs to  be executed and then put in a satanic shrine until judgement day.,?
7333,HPD will love going to Court as that is overtime for them. It is the same thing with DUI's The police love it because they get to look good to their superiors and it means boku overtime pay.  Same thing with manning the road blocks  boku overtime pay paid for by the Feds.  It is and has always been about the money.  If the City was paying the overtime for the road blocks  it would not happen.,?
7334,Nice  future camping grounds for the homeless.,?

7336,Did you buy or rent in Anc bowl which turns to jello when a quake occures.,?
7337,All Republicans and Trumperatti take note. Someone finally had the guts to stand up to this clown who thinks the US government is his own personal sandbox. The Republicans are the same people that went after Bill Clinton for lying  but they haven't seen anything about Trump that concerns them. The GOP will support anything that Trump does  no matter how stupid.  If Trump actually did something so stupid that they couldn't possibly possibly support it  they'd say it didn't happen.,?
7338,since when do Tweets qualify as promises?,?
7339,Yes on 8!  Keep the union overlords out of our pocketbooks.   https://aws.state.ak.us/ApocReports/CampaignDisclosure/View.aspx?ID=14945  The AFL-CIO  financed 2/3's of the cost of the campaign against Prop 8.

7344,You nailed it !!!!   They can endlessly hit the re-set button  their entitlement permits them. We are talking about a people who are so disconnected from reality that  they didn't know  until 8pm on election day that they were losing the Presidency  The House and The Senate. They now believe that dehumanizing trump and his supporters will help them  in the upcoming primary's in Republican held states !!!! What fools.,?
7345,Like the gold washed goon in the WH  you'll say anything stupid so others pay you some attention. PT Barnum and Roy Cohen are smiling upon thee.,?
7346,This article is pure bunk.  The democrats work hard every day to make blacks believe republicans will kill their children via the police. Trump only detailed how the country is today under the dems and how he will improve it.  Sorry Pitts  you dems lose the election  you lose foreign policy America bashing and surrendering  you lose teachers union bribes  and you already lost the miners and steelworkers with your cronies sucking at the government teat of overpriced solar/wind power.,?

7349," Nuclear war " ... " Global war " .... what a pile of garbage rhetoric from news outlets trying to sell papers. Nobody .. neither Putin nor Trump is that stupid.,?
7350,Sure glad you comment all the time. Its always entertaining to read such bizarre legal logic that always seems to favor the criminal.,?
7351,Give me a break! Trump is a Republican! If he wasn't a republican he wouldn't have went along with Paul Ryan on his stupid health bill that would kick millions of people off of any type of care.  He also would not be rushing laws deregulating everything that he could if he was an independent or a Democrat.  Also him giving tax breaks to the rich is another tell tale of the GOP basic requirements.  Trump is nothing more than a con artist and a Child in a Man's Body.,?
7352,I hope the Dems do something stupid like that...,?
7353,Who ever said pot cured anything? It helps some cancer and chronic pain sufferers to ease pain. What is the problem? No one cares about millions of drinkers! That's legal and makes distilleries for alcohol and beer breweries and wineries billions. It's been destroying children's lives  killing people for six decades that I have lived and longer. For those who are allergic   do not like taste or smell of booze pot works for them. Ban booze if you ban pot  and be done with it or shut up about something that's no body's business except smokers. Talk about I want mine but nobody can have theirs crap. You holy righteous bammers are so hypocritical.,?
7354,Eh.  She's FAR worse than merely a 'racist'...,?
7355,Really  R.D.?  So people who disagree with your hero Trump have no First Amendment rights?,?
7356,Yah  very little of the math adds up. And they leave out the wife's income. Based on what we have  paying off their mortgage in the next three years is their "goal" but right now  with their current payments it will take decades. I guess what they re trying to say is over the next year they will be increasing their monthly mortgage payments substantially from where they are now. Seems like a tall order.,?
7357,Just in case I end witnessing something like this.  https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/28/in-that-moment-i-loathed-america-i-loathed-the-entire-country I'm not concerned about myself  but I can't stomach what's happening to other people in the US just because of their places of origin. To me it's a matter of principle.,?

7359,This little man  Justin  should resign now to stop the embarrassment for Canada.  Castro was a brutal dictator who murdered his enemies and almost played a pivotal role in the destruction of North America and the world.

Despite his poor average this year  his on base % was great  and he still does a great job behind the plate.  Tulo  on the other hand...

7367,gw lies have your brain gone stupid,?
7368,So let me get this straight.....  This numb-nuts decided to sleep out in the wilderness where bears live and a being a bear  acted like a bear.  So based on this  the bear is exterminated.  So can we then please castrate this future presidential candidate from the left wing so he can't contaminate the rest of the gene pool??  ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS!!!,?
7369,I always read your comments because sometimes they are articulate and relevant. However when you attack all of the citizens of this wonderful state as being idiots it really detracts tremendously from anything you said before.  Obviously we do not all vote the same and we interact differently with our government  all trying to do the best we can to help within our communities and state as a whole..  The attacks on  all y all' and others should really be removed from your diatribes!,?
7370,I am not arguing that food  shelter  safety even should be the main determinants  but that Oxfam and the like have different perspectives when it suits them. As far as the second hand market on X boxes  smartphones and the like  I don't know but accept what you say.,?
7371,There you go again little troll  itsme.  People like you are corrupt.,?
7372,Why 20% and not 15% or 50%? Why pick any random number? Why GNP and not GDP?  What services would you cut to get to your 20% Healthcare? Education? What would you do with all the unemployed people cutting those services would entail?,?
7373,What rubbish. If LNG export terminals are not economically feasible  the government in power now or in the past doesn't matter. Give it up! As far as the not fully details growth plans from the new government they haven't had a chance.   If you want to criticize any political movement  they're provided ample scope. Have at it. Making hay out of utter rubbish is an insult to readers.,?
7374,I keep forgetting that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Those who admire a bombastic  sociopathic liar like Trump will emulate him.,?
7375,So what would you call a person who supports and would vote for a serial liar  thief  conniving  hateful  dishonest  despicable  disgraceful  sexual predator enabler?,?
7376,"the decision to pass on the Ivanka Trump brand had been based on its performance."  Her brand is clearly "weak"  so she must be a "loser".   Why is Trump supporting weak losers?  Sad.,?
7377,Bannon is a sick joker.  He needs to be booted from the White House entirely.  And I agree:  the bizarre  ignorant and ineffective trump administration is now no longer a joke.  Real crises are beginning to face the nation and Trump has looked bad so far. We certainly miss the intellect and integrity of Obama.,?
7378,I heard they're planning one at Waianae Mall at 3 PM also...otherwise  I bet half of Waianae would be at the airport!,?
7379,LIfe has become so cheap in Alaska that we should have a death penalty not only to deter murder but also to extirpate these worthless scumbags from our society.,?

7386,Are you sober?,?
7387,Richard is shamelessly blinded by anti-Israel bias  just as much as the UN. Israel is a beacon of stability surrounded by chaos  violence  and anarchy. The UN is a joke  just look at Russia and the Sakhalins  Tibet  Crimea  the South China Sea but you pick on Israel for defending itself against aggressors. "We tried to destroy you but we lost  can we please have our land back?" Of course we can't talk about Jordan or how other Arab states treat Palestinians  it's all Israel's fault - you reek of unapologetic leftwing ignorance  you have no credibility and represent the outspoken leftwing fringe of useful idiots who turn a blind eye to Hamas terrorists and their Islamist supporters - pathetic.,?
7388,MB1962  The conflict is simple. Fund companies pay the advisor a trailer 'fee' every year they keep someone's money in the fund. There is no incentive for the advisor to look for a better investment for the client.(like just buying equities that don't pay kickbacks to the advisor)  It would be like a pharmaceutical company paying a doctor to prescribe their drugs.  A clear conflict of interest.   The advisor's primary concern should be increasing their client's portfolio balance  getting 'kickbacks' from fund companies (trailer fees) can clearly affect the advisor's decision.   The fact that this story was quickly whisked from the top of G&M's home page and buried in the investing section shows the money that is pushing to let the status quo remain.   Trailer fees should have been banned in Canada years ago.,?
7389,Way to go Wal-Mart. Assholes.,?
7390,Our stupid grade school president at his finest!   Donald Trump's temper-tantrum tactics have been explained by the man himself. The front runner for the Republican presidential nomination admitted to his biographer that  "When I look at myself in the first grade and I look at myself now  I’m basically the same. The temperament is not that different.",?
7391,This is Hawaii---the Councilman is against the project because they are using non-union labor PERIOD!!!!,?
7392,I'm surprised by those disparaging programs like this.  Here  is where positive social values are seeded.  There is NO technical or discursive curriculum for getting social values and human character instilled in the youth.  The three "R"s are not material  but instead  fine arts  culture  physical education  family living  history  and similar.  Only positive social values assure against Hawaii's costly crimes  health premiums  terrorism  over-development greed  crooked politicians  corrupt state judges  etc.  The three "R"s assure nothing of the sort.  I'd rather have a local society MORE FILLED by functional  viable family units headed by janitors  yardmen  carpenters  masons  waitresses  auto mechanics  fitness teachers  and masseurs as compared to doctors  lawyers  and Indian chiefs such as marketeers  land developers  engineers  architects   journalists  scientists  astronomers  and pharmaceuticals.,?
7393,Trump is a pile of garbage.  Trump didn't rape anybody.  Re-defining the word "rape" to fit ones intellect is the pinnacle of shameless mindless pandering.  I can't stand that America elected this orange idiot.  Having read your fragmented psychotic manifesto for the last 4 months  if there is any upside it is that you will be beside yourself for the next 4 years. Your blood pressure will be high and your body will produce excess cortisol.  That makes me happy.   It appears your probation period with civil comments has ended again. will you resume your little groups blanket flagging of opinions you don't share or are they on to you?,?
7394,BC was a perv  HC lied  and trump is the worst of them rolled into one. Keep going with that.,?
7395,From a man that claims to be a Christian but doesn't have any Christian qualities very much like lots of his fake Christian followers . Greedy   spiteful  pompous  arrogant and a sexist .,?
7396,Thing you trump idiots fail to recognize is even with a wall the cartels will find ways to get drugs and people in and bring back guns and money. Mexican cartels get guns from here. Without guns they wouldnt be able to do illegal activities. Yet who provides them with guns? USA does. You trump people disgust me and wish y'all could be deported to Russia,?
7397,So your credible new source is Trump?   Moron.,?
7398,Just to be clear: Employer (that means taxpayer) contributions go to 22.15% of payroll  with an automatic increase to 24.15% if PERA's optimistic investment return assumptions turn out to be wrong.  This means either cuts to other education programming that benefits our kids - sports  activities  AP classes  social/emotional supports  etc. -- or higher taxes via Mill Levy Overrides  since more state funding for K12 is unlikely to be forthcoming (due to competing needs for more infrastructure spending and rapidly rising social safety net costs).  This additional taxpayer money will go to teachers who  thanks to TECDA  can't be fired  no matter how poorly they perform (if they are in a union school)  in a state where chronic teacher absenteeism is rampant  where we are told that more than 95% of Colorado's teachers are effective or highly effective  but where less than a third of our kids graduate college and career ready  in a system on which taxpayers already spend billions.,?
7399,Fairly large hole in this story: Where's he played the last two years?,?
7400,I'd happily vote for Sarah Palin over Murkowski.,?
7401,A narcissist like Trump always has a treasure trove of selfies.  Bet me money this fake orange haired narcissist doesn't have a walk-in vault of tapes.,?
7402,So  so pathetic. All of these items should be returned to the people of Iraq and why you even raise that question is ridiculous. Maybe you're some mole for the filthy green family or hobby lobby cult  but there's no way anyone who stole these artifacts should be able to retain a single thing. I guess purposeful stupidity is the new role for rubes who play the xtianity card.,?
7403,It's not the jealousy or greed  it's the death and injury that follows.  Guns make creating injuries and death easier.  Why continue down that path?,?
7404,Enjoy  most of you people voted him in! " stop harper" ahahaha ya because fiscally prudent sucks,?
7405,Although we came close with disco.,?

7410,another stupid comment,?
7411,Kiellor is a washed up fat old hound dog that don't hunt! He comes from a make-believe Minneapolis  mid-west excuse of a liberal town where the loveable  laughable progressives let in Somalis just for kicks and giggles and they then have crime waves and a refugee that stabs innocents in a Mall. We rule Kiellor needs to go back to his funny farm and grow some loco weed...once again!,?

7413,Women can be very horrible users and abusers themselves ,?
7414,This is laughable.  So those who voted for Trump voted for sexually abusing women and keeping Blacks out of housing?  It is incredible to me now blindness effects the sighted.,?
7415,Whereas pathologically lying Trump gets a pass  correct?  He's done nothing but lie from the instant he got in the race to the present. I thought all Republicans and right wingers supported Trump? If you support him you support his corruption  incessant lying  thievery and other well-known sociopathic traits demonstrating his lack of any sort of stability.    Pathetic.,?
7416,Yes  yes  we're all sure that you know better than Mr. Haycox  distinguished professor emeritus at UAA.  What a knucklehead!  P.S. Would it kill you to use punctuation?,?
7417,I don't think these people understand that every time they use the 79% statistic they lose support for their cause.  If they can't be honest about the problem - how can there be a substantive discussion about the solution?  From the brief info that we have  this may be a legitimate case of gender discrimination  but by throwing around the 79% statistic as though it means something the attorney really looks agenda driven.,?
7418,Hmmmm from NOAA "The most recent annual population assessment shows the Hawaiian monk seal bucking past trends  has increased in numbers by 3% annually for the past three years." Obviously  cats should not be near endangered bird breeding grounds but people like Sizemore and Lepczyk want outdoor cats eliminated from the face of the Earth.  These conservationists dismiss trap neuter release as ineffective but it does work and it is not done with taxpayer dollars.,?

7422,Good Parenting...so refreshing to hear.  Lynx is fortunate to have parents choosing to raise her in such an amazing place and with such good guidance.  Thanks for sharing your story.,?
7423,WaPo is such a pathetic birdcage liner. Like so many liberal rags every word they print has one goal  bring down Trump  or more specifically  bring down anything conservative.,?
7424,I watched and he is an arrogant  condescending  delusional whack job. I wouldn't put him in charge of my garbage collection let alone the USA. It sure doesn't take much to ruffle his feathers and there were a few times he looked and sounded like he was going to come completely unhinged,?
7425,Surely this will be solved once voter registration is linked to the PFD database.,?
7426,Breaking news...snowflakes do not exist. That falling snow is just your imagination. No  breaking news...man discovered making fake  unique snowflakes and dropping them to the ground!,?
7427,Waiting for all the children to come out. Young boys and scantily clad young girls. Especially girls. Girls unveiled. Legitimate target for Islamist scum.,?
7428,Challenging actions by the Executive Branch that may be (emphasize "may") unconstitutional is fundamental to our democracy. To just nod and applaud any Executive action without review and "extreme vetting" is a walkway to Facism  as German citizens saw first hand in the 1930's. I'll gladly support expenditure of my tax dollars if the issue at hand is Constitutional in nature.,?
7429,It's so weird to have an actual stupid narcissistic childish person in the white house. GW Bush wasn't the sharpest knife in the drawer  but at least he was moral and had a conscience. This guy is certified. I haven't seen anything like this in my lifetime. What were the people who voted for him thinking?,?
7430,Were you one of the idiots who shoved Goose Creek Prison down the state's throat? When prisons in rural Alaska communities were supposed to be repaired?  I know for a fact funds for rural prison repairs went directly to Goose Creek. And it got changed or redirected in the DOC.   I know the bible thumpers from Wasilla and near by prayed lots for more jobs that Goose Creek prison would bring.,?
7431,Just like Obamacare...whatchaknow,?
7432,lefty punks and misfits nothing more. These leftist street punks would collapse into a fetal position and cry like little babies under real war conditions. They would be the first to go AWOL run away and hide under fire then cry about suffering from PTSD.  Easy for them to attack and riot in a free and open society with little repercussion.  Leftist cowards and cry babies.,?
7433,If one accepts Marx's premise that religion is the opium of the people  I believe it is time that our society began to view the addiction to this mind-numbing distraction as an issue to be dealt with.,?
7434,Good for the Conservatives.  Don't let the Liberals slander them without fighting back.  What's good for one side is good for the other.  Liberals are born hypocrites and this just further proves it.,?
7435,I feel deflated and disappointed. Worse  I feel betrayed. I know Bernie lost  but it was not fair and square. Why aren't we screaming for another vote? Clinton is a liar  her campaign was a lie  and she and DWS schemed to deny Bernie his rightful place. I cannot bear to vote for her. So if I split the vote  so be it. Vote your conscience. This old hippie will be writing in Bernie Sanders.,?
7436,No  dirt bags and sociopaths will cause crimes.,?
7437,Im not thumbing you at all Dick......,?
7438,WTF is wrong with ainokea people nowadays!! geez man  stealing a freakin wheelchair  come on man  this a as low as you can get.   I hope this news will be a blessing for this  young man.  his ticket to show his talents!! that kalihi rep  should get his buddies and get his young man a new wheelchair. all the crooks at the state capital gotta have some side cash from under da table RAIL deals  to get this guy new wheels.  step up reps!!,?
7439,Yes but if your parents had chosen the option you suggest you would not be able to give us your uninformed opinion on this matter.,?
7440,get it stupid  you are another snowflake  get some help for your hate and delusions. trump is leading  and you cry cry cry   ,?
7441,I'm sorry  but the thing in this story about a massively barbaric act that jumped put at me was that Cardinal Parolin sent a telegram. Who sends telegrams nowadays?  If you want to jump all over me for that reaction  go ahead.,?
7442,Trump is a heartless character.  What have whales/turtles ever done to him? This was a simple thing he could have upheld  he's SO MEAN he can't even do this.  It's pathetic how mean this guy is.  He'll whine  yell   scream  complain worse than Nixon when he steps down.  He will.  He will be the last to know it then maybe this rule can be reversed before  the whales and turtles go extinct due to the meanest jerk on the planet.  No conscience whatsoever. Doesn't treat his kid much better  shipping him to boarding school to get rid of the embarrassing situation which is pathetic.    A lot of Trumpies like animals.  They won't like this.,?
7443,Religion is evil.,?
7444,Silly rabbit.  The children of the 1% don't go to public school.   You think their parents want them hanging around people like you?,?
7445,You are still here spreading you ignorance I see with your silly silly posts..,?

7451,he ain't that young - just acts like it - the fool is closer to 50 than 40.,?
7452,Hurry up and die.  You are a disgrace,?
7453,That's terrific little fella.  A return to the stone age might be just what is needed to turn things around,?
7454,Hard to tell what the teacher was doing. Here's some reporting on it from the Washington Times (reliably to the right): "Students were required to submit descriptions of their presentations for approval by their English teacher  but the two offending students changed their skit after it was already approved  the Express-News reported. Barry Perez  spokesman for the Northside Independent School District  said campus officials determined that the teacher did not condone the skit and ended up putting a stop to it."  On the other hand  it doesn't say what the changes were.,?
7455,One people  one country. Two awful leaders.,?
7456,Bigots  racists  nazi's  white supremacists  evangelicals  and "some good people" lol  part of the normal republican party these days.   And I heard this from reliable sources  Special Agent Mueller is going to pop trump's a** soon.  imua  aloha & mahalo,?

7459,Midway through the election on Sept 15  Morneau had reported that he sold off 180 255 common shares in the company worth $3 million. The shares where sold in May  a month before he secured the nomination as Liberal candidate.  Insider trader reports indicate that  at last filling  Morneau still indirectly owned 2 066 480 common shares in Morneau  Shapell  worth about $32 000 000 """""" through a numbered company"""""" in Alberta.  Curious....Morneau owes us some answers.,?
7460,I think Trevor will last this season. He has a better line. He has learned to get rid of the ball rather than take a sack. I think he has also learned to get rid of the ball quicker and not hold and run like early last year. He also has a better stable of running backs along with more shotgun formation to see the hit coming.   I have no idea about Chad Kelly. He has talent but he is a loose cannon. With his history  I am not so sure he won't be out of the league in a year or two.,?
7461,Fire that loser  get someone in there with a good head on his shoulders  isn't that General Flynn at loose ends?,?
7462,Yeesh what is this world coming to.  Oh no  someone called me a Canuck the other day  my feelings are now hurt  I better take time off work and sue someone  and someone better get punished.  LBGT...isn't that an ice cream store? :)    Whatever... what a joke...like where did this come from recently  your now proud of it? My apology would have gone like this:  I'm very sorry you are a bunch of queers!!!!,?
7463,The word "racism" never wears out  sadly  as long as racism exists  as it does today. A million avowed racists  by their own boasting  voted for Trump  and he certainly didn't turn down their votes. Yes  we have as a president a man who refuses to disavow virulent white anti-black  anti-jew racism by scum like the Aryan Nation  half of whom are in prison for various truly nasty felonies. Do you like those punks  Phil?,?
7464,Where's Loreana Bobbitt when she is needed most?,?
7465,Trump makes a historic visit to Saudi Arabia and what does the FakeNews .com cover? Melania's hair! Good job SA for publishing trash. Trashy paper  but appropriate for a Dem Party newsletter. Look at all the BoZos just eating it up like scavengers. It would be sad if it wasn't so funny.,?
7466,Trudeau will not sleep until  every last grain of sand in this country is under Chinese ownership. He is a disgrace and an embarrassment to all of Canada.,?

7470,I'm not a gun owner and I don't see any guns in my future... what has happened to this business is a bunch of crap!  Keep standing strong and I really hope people will take the advise that is written in this article... educate yourself.  Emotions are high I get it  but give our very small businesses on the Island a break... just pisses me off!,?
7471,As if these clowns will make ANY difference at all....HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!  Puleeeeeezzeeee........,?
7472,flippin awesome!! trumpster cleans up the country while the low life anarchists burn our buildings and burn the flag. find the dirty punks and deport them to Syria. its gonna be fabulous  fire up some popcorn!!,?
7473,There are an awful lot of rotten things about Trump  and the evidence is in his own words...or do you think "left wing sheep" made up the bit about grabbing pu**y  about seeing "thousands" of Muslims cheering 9/11  about accusing the Mexican Government of sending rapists  about his mad claim that "millions" of illegal votes were cast?  Perhaps it's the Trumpanistas going "baa  baa".,?
7474,All anti hate groups are wrong and pathetic.  That being said  all people in the Country have a right to voice their opinions (without violence of course) right  wrong  indifferent.  The problem is that anyone that voices an opinion anymore that differs from the left are just racist  anti American and should be expelled from the Country no matter who they are.  If BLM groups can march down the middle of streets chanting kill police  blocking traffic  destroying property then I guess these KKK racist thugs also have a right to march and protest chanting whatever it is they chant...,?
7475,Why anybody would ever listen to MoreFees Handemovermann again is beyond me.,?
7476,With all that much drama do you think it would be better to stop forcing it on the customer and have them sign an "opt out and assume all obligation" form that leaves them on the hook for paying for any damages caused by said tree in the future?,?
7477,You hit it in the first sentence  the stupidity of Tory supporters will tarnish the party for a generation or so.,?
7478,So  no Jewish immigrants? No Seventh-Day Adventists  or other fundamentalist Christian sects who prohibit pork? No vegetarians regardless of origin?  So much ignorance and bigotry. Pathetic.,?
7479,The mainstream media is the reason Trump won. They were too blinded by the big bright light (Trumps outrageous behavior) to focus on substance. And for all of the right wingers crying and whining in every single article's thread about the evil liberal media  they are unaware of this fact and it's funny to me. Apparently too busy parroting their talking points from garbage right wing sources to use any critical thought. Blah  blah evil liberal media blah blah. Meanwhile  Trump lied to all of them about putting Hillary in jail and building a wall. But are they outraged? Nope. They'll shut their little mouths about it like good minions and say what the right wing media wants them to say. But by all means  keep thinking the only ones getting fooled here are liberals and their media outlets.,?
7480,Writing for the Globe should not include leaving oneself open to being called "that odious columnist"  a liar and a "deranged left wing loon.",?
7481,Maybe as a joe taxpayer we are tired of all the sunny ways come campaign time and then the F**K Y*U the next day. Hey dumbass where is my canoe shed you promised,?
7482,Hillary Clinton is a LOSER. End of discussion.,?
7483,DUMP CLARK!!!  She's got a 1-2 punch: Sleazy and toxic to nature.,?
7484,Boo-Boo is probably thinking that if humans are in his territory  why can't a happy go lucky bear be in their territory?? He saw them candies and realized why humans got weak teeth and pathetic looking fingernails compared to his razor sharp teeth and claws!! Probably gone back to his den and wrote a report to the great Owlbear God.,?
7485,You haven't told a fact yet. I'm not sure you can recognize one.  It is disturbing that you can't admit that. Your blind persecution (proven in this string alone) of me is both childish and frightening. The hatred drips from every remark you make to me. I am actually becoming worried about you.,?
7486,Disgusting. You think protesting cops shooting unarmed blacks is the same as neo-Nazis and the KKK?   Don't take this the wrong way  but is there something in your water?,?
7487,The democrats are not going to be happy until we are all un-armed and cowering helplessly face-down on the floor of a gay bar toilet.,?

7490,Stephen ? Which are you ? a proud Homophobe ? Xenophobe ? Racist ? Or another closeted gay Republican ?  wear it loud and proud  get a big " L" tattooed on your forehead.,?
7491,McCain is an addled old goat  and he showed it here.  He should have been gone long ago.  He held his disfavor of Trump above what was good for the party  and the country.  McCain is an old  sick  addled fool.  Not a hero  a GOAT.,?
7492,Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.) offers a reminder:  One of the more obscure torments in Hades is attempting to rank RepubliCons by stupidity.,?
7493,Vote NDP if you want Canada to be like Russia/Venezuela/Cuba  Vote Liberal if you want Canada to be like the UK/Germany/France Vote Conservative if you want Canada to be NORMAL.,?
7494,They don't promote equality  they promote fairness. Same with Germany.    A gold miner in South Africa can actually afford to buy an ounce of gold. But in South Africa a gold miner is usually unskilled labour and priced out of the market compared with unskilled labour elsewhere. A gold miner in say Australia is an engineer  because most of their mining sector is automated. Our unskilled miners fall prey to predatory lending  but earnings wise they earn quite a bit!  India and China are playing catch-up with market reforms. That's another key difference between just having a big welfare state with high taxes  and having a free market to support your social spending which you don't cripple with taxes and regulations. They're coming from opposite sides of the spectrum  with Norway and Sweden already having markets to support their social spending.,?
7495,Yep. I'm so tired of the "liberal media" pretending he was going to "pivot" at some point. Or constantly lowering the bar so that this stupid moron can step over it. He's always been a loser and a terrible human being and that's been obvious for decades to anyone willing to pay attention. They need to stop making excuses for him.    Like saying Twitler "became presidential" when he ordered a missile launch. Any idiot can order a missile launch.   This idiot is not normal and having this kind of idiocy in the WH is not normal.   No more excuses.,?
7496,They don't know the difference.  It's just pathetic.,?
7497,Incorrect.  Someone who says "diversity is our weakness" may be absolutely fine with immigration but be expressing a view that accepting all diversity of traditional cultural expressions over what is acceptable in a modern  gender-egalitarian Canada is our weakness.  That by not expecting immigrants to drop certain diverse practices in favour of what's acceptable today in Canada is our weakness.  (Again  I'm not saying whether or not I agree.)  But because you are a liberal/progressive you jump to censor  will not allow the expression ("then you shouldn't use that phrase")  will not consider an exploration of the person's meaning  so you have no option but to lay your own narrow assumptions over the opinion expressed.  I hope you know this.  And (again incorrect assumption) I'm not "dude".,?

7513,I'm so saddened to hear of Derrick's passing. He was one of my favorite customers at Perk Up Place. My thoughts are with his family & friends.,?
7514,Syria is one of the oldest civilizations in the world  and Aleppo was once a beautiful city. Many North Americans have little idea about the depth and breadth of culture there. The academic tradition is strong and even during the conflict  universities have continued to function. What has happened to Syria and to millions of displaced people is tragic.   When The Handmaid's Tale first came out  many did liken it to the emerging phenom of in vitro and surrogacy. The first successful surrogacy was in '85. Like all comparisons  it works on some levels but not on others.,?
7515,"minority laden"  Racist and hateful much  gofastgo?,?
7516,This is just stupid. People can buy fireworks that are "illegal" and have been setting them off for years. Instead of forcing them to surreptitiously set them off in neighborhoods  where they frighten pets and pose a fire hazard  why not set aside a safe place for them to do so at their own risk? That's how it is done all across Europe. Like they do in Washington at places like Anderson Island. Reserve a section at a beach  charge a nominal fee to cover cleanup and policing  and let people do what they're going to do anyways  but in a safer and controlled manner.,?
7517,Without VPNs  how will China steal content from the West?  The might have to invent their own content  and we all know how well that works.,?
7518,White-hating  racist shitbag you are wyatt dick.,?
7519,As long as people are judging this young man in the court of public opinion  I feel I might chime in on how ignorant two of these post's PERSONAL views  on a complicated social issue threatening our society  really are. First of all there is a presumption of innocence in a court of law before any evidence is presented to the jury. I assume it's to limit the amount of innocent people punished for crimes they didn't commit. To state your opinion of guilt after seeing a few sentences in an article  shows how ignorant you are of the rule of law. What if the police had questioned the wrong drunken idiot? And secondly  if the poster who thinks that tougher laws and harsher penalties is going to stop people from taking mind and mood altering substances  then you are deluded. you should go back to sleep and keep dreaming of your squeaky clean sandbox world where everyone conforms to your idea of society.   people have been taking drugs for two thousand years and will continue to regardless.,?

7522,Those colored students that tried to get served at Jim Crow drug stores had a simple right they were trying to get honored (and I think some of those drug stores served cake!).,?
7523,You're assuming that you are retiring with a paid-off home. More and more people nowadays are not doing that  what with easily available refinancings and home equity lines of credit.,?
7524,The old double standard. It's ok for Senator  Kevin Meyer  a Conoco employee  to vote on any Conoco oil related bill  but not ok for Flynn to vote because he has a conflict of interest.  Scratches on equal protection.  Last time I checked that was a Constitutional issue.,?
7525,When I was a young man growing up  Donald Trump would have been arrested and convicted of Communism by the U.S. Govt. What gives with his behavior today? His top military people smoozing with the Commies  like WTH happened to the U.S.?   Look at any jet fighter produced by the Soviet Union and you will be able to easily compare each model to advanced aircraft produced by the United States  that tells me that Espionage is where the Russians get their Military aircraft design ideas.  Trump jumping into bed with the Ruskies is like leaving Grandma to be babysat by the Big Bad Wolf. Trump is to dumb to run a cool-aid stand  because he want $15 dollars for a glass of Kool-aid. Trump is all hype and no-substance. Even the Russians recognize Trump as an idiot  that is WHY they have videos on his behavior.  Stupid is as Stupid does. Source: Forrest Gump https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_Komi7wnAw,?
7526,There was strong evidence that the Dividians set the fire and then tried to hide in a tunnel.  Koresh had no intension of giving up.  He was a coward and used innocent children as his shield.  To believe otherwise is pure idiocy.,?

7530,Gabbard is just stupid she was fooled by Assad just like the the foolish Obama administration. We finally have a LEADER President Trump that will keep America safe. All we have in Hawaii is a bunch of cackling hens as congress people and a brown nosing Senator in Schatz. Nothing will get done in the next eight year for Hawaii with our leadership fighting the administration.,?

7543,If he is an honorable man  he would resign and let the public know why.  I feel NO sorrow for those working for Trumplethinskin and  when they find out how used they are  still keep the jobs and pout in the corner.  Honor can come with a price.  And the idea that they can stick around and hope to have a positive effect on a narcissistic sociopath is sadly laughable.,?
7544,Donald Trump is trying to play both sides. Here is a guy that pretended to not know who David Duke is  and what David Duke is about. Does America want this type of person leading their nation? Do they want the lying  duplicitous coward Trump?,?

The West innovates  Asia copies and then sells it back to us at half the cost because companies don't give a damn where they got it from and CEOs walk away with short term bonuses.

Do you have any recollection of Harper and Mulroney for example?  Consistently  it is Conservatives who were and are the party that always opposed unions  which were the best and only protection against workers being exploited. Republicans do the same in the States. Not Liberals.  Get educated.,?

You are no longer rebels  just obedient conformist progressive liberals. I'm being polite! As Trump says; "You can all go F&^K yourselves!",?
7563,This has to be the most blatantly inaccurate load of BS the G&M has ever printed!  They should pull this piece of garbage immediately.,?
7564,Pretty sure trump hates America  because it wasn't his idea.  The bedrock of our great nation and it's still great no matter what trump and his supporters say for their own benefit  is the legitimacy of the presidential vote. I don't care what your politics are you don't start down the path of rejecting that.   He has no idea what he's doing  he has no idea of the potential consequences of such talk and he doesn't care because it's all about his paper thin ego. This is proof enough he has no business being president.  Hillary is everything you expect from a career politician  a real shady a**hole  but that can't legitimize voting for someone who is both so ignorant and so callous as to threaten the continuation of our democracy because he's got a tiny penis,?
7565,I can appreciate these are not actual transactions and there is no real money changing hands.  However  albeit small  by not including transactions fees into the calculations the end result will be somewhat skewed based on the initial purchases plus purchases made from dividend payouts.  The numbers for the non-registered "transactions" will not take into account the ACB value if and when they are sold and therefore taxes on gains/losses won't be factored correctly.    That said  I'm watching your strategy with interest.,?
7566,that is ridiculous.  Anglos in Canada exploited french canadians for generations.  Multiculturalism allowed them to single out and prey upon an identifiable cultural group different from their own. Respect is the key.,?

The city likes having heroin all over the place  wouldn't surprise me if they are involved in helping the illegal criminals????????????? meanwhile.....take this down so no one sees and true comment  does that hurt  it does? ship out the scum.,?

7589,Economists don't pay me thousands of dollars every year.   Plus  as a common shareholder of many of these companies  these CEOs work for me.  If I don't like them  I get one vote for every share I own  and I will vote to oust them.  The choice doesn't belong to economists  it belongs to the owners (common shareholders).,?
7590,Fact is  the Constitutional Court  full of many learned Justices has ruled after considering all the issues. Does the author know better?  I Googled Claytile  Muldersvlei.... quite a way east of Durbanville  N of the N1. The workers were clearly not 'agricultural' but  broadly speaking factory workers  not farm-workers.. The reasons for dismissal are unclear but 6 years back. Wolwerivier  is somewhat south and east of Atlantis.   Were they ever 'agricultural workers'... all very unclear.  If I recall  the former houses were brick but dilapidated  the latter  corrugated  fairly newly constructed. Both places are outside of urban areas  maybe peri-urban a better description.   No good choices here!,?
7591,I am shocked by the costs of daycare mentioned in the article and comments. In Quebec  most private "family day care" cost around 40$ per day (10k/year). and they are not allowed to take more than 6 kids. That represents an income over 60k$/year. That seems like a fair price given the level of specialization?  I know Toronto is expansive but 2ok$ per year per kid seems crazy...,?

And before this post gets yanked for "uncivility " realize that I am answering a direct question from a person who believes that his straw man argument is actually intelligent; and go read Jonathan Swift. Yeah  I know. He's an old dead white guy. Read him anyway.,?
7600,Gerald Tamura - That's one helluva assumption you make by asserting I would be defending the electoral college process while discounting the popular vote. Feel free to assume what you wish  but you don't know me.  If you did  you'd know that for decades I've favored the candidates for president win by the popular vote rather than the electoral vote.  You owe me an apology  but I don't expect one.  I agree that every president certainly has the authority (mandate) to make change.  However  there is a huge difference between Trump's extraordinarily weak mandate and the robust mandates of past presidents  such as Johnson's when he thumped Goldwater in '64 and Reagan's when he crushed Carter in '80.    And as for wondering if I really am Warren Keogh  yes  I am who I say I am.  No pseudonym wanted or needed.,?
7601,Does Donnie know Treason is still a capital offense  nah turnip truck trump and his acolytes know jack  and proves it with every inane and insane  tweet......,?
7602,Ummmm...my reason absolutely would cover a Hitler statue. This one. "For many years  I and my parents  then us and our children  would stop while traveling thru and read the towns displayed statue(s) - what they represented. That opened the door to American history discussions."  Second  re this (Refresher on the specific actual words: "Traitors to the Constitution and the United States of America...Never forget their treason. Deal?") to which I strongly disagree-they did what California is trying to do right now. Is that also treason? Or?  Now this (which is just now asked of me) I can answer w/no dodging involved -> "I asked you before and you dodged. Upon what principles was the Confederacy built? "   Here is the answer.  * Definition of confederacy: a group of people  countries  organizations  etc.  that are joined together in some activity or effort. the Confederacy : the group of 11 southern states that separated themselves from the U.S. during the American Civil War.,?
7603,I wish I could gave been a kindly fly following you on your journey. What a wonderful trip and I enjoyed every column you wrote. Good to see you're home in one piece and please give Ms. Cora a big hug from me! You're a Good Man  Ned Rozell.,?

7605,This fool is still writing?,?
7606,And the grounds for your lawsuit is exactly what?  Weapons defective?  Weapons were illegally modified before point of sale? Regulations not followed? Manufacturers and distributers knew that a crime was going to be committed? No background check? Was there some kind of negligence on there part?  What's your case Shannon?  Anyway  your idea is very unoriginal and will probably fail like the previous lawsuits. The Sandy Hook lawsuit is still winding it's way through Court so we'll see.   Today the manufacture and distribution of weapons per State and Federal regulations is lawful commerce and therefore protected.   If you want guns banned or controlled  then you need to re-write the Constitution. Good luck on that one.,?
7607,Lets hope she does not create more terrorist breeding grounds. Bush. Obama and Hilary really gave a boost to the spread of Islam which is pretty stupid.,?
7608,Excellent article. Unfortunately it won't negate all the years of lies and propaganda promulgated by Fox media and the im-moral majority  but maybe it will cause a few to start thinking logically for a change.,?
7609,Gun stores could do more comprehensive background checks.  They could also require the mental equivalent of a physical.  "people who have been adjudicated as mentally defective are still prohibited from firearm possession."  What about all of the people who haven't been adjudicated?  We'll just keep giving them guns until they commit mass murder?  Shouldn't we take the guns away from those who are dangerous before they commit a crime  not after?,?

7619,I can understand where Robyn is coming from.  This team is just to nice  does not have that mean streak  or plays with that chip on their shoulder  to put teams away once they get the lead.  They most often then not let teams back in  especially the good ones.  That is what Robyn means when she says  "they fight at the wrong time".  This team only fights when they are behind not when they are ahead.  It is the most important thing Robyn needs to instill in next year's team  and what she has been trying to do with this team.,?
7620,LOL  maybe Trump should take her to court? Some place he has a lot of experience in visiting over the years ;),?
7621,LV police didn't detain or subdue him for 'no reason'. Didn't happen. I don't have to have been there. If he's in an area where a perceived threat is  he's going to be detained and held. What time of morning was it  what was he up to and did he resist detainment? Yup  sure he did. Here we go again.,?
7622,Seems like people will grumble no matter how much of a raise they get.  If they don't get raises now when the economy is doing fine  then they probably won't get anything or even a pay cut the next time either when the economy will probably tank ,?

7628,This hag is mentally ill.  Not only did she express desires to harm our President and his then 10-year-old son in 2016----this year  she held a bloody mask of a severed head  depicting President Trump!  I can only imagine the terror this young boy must have suffered!  Now Witch Kathy is accusing our president of causing her to lose her job!  She did this all by herself!  Her morbid actions were called a joke!    When President Trump retweets something that was printed in an article  he is accused of violence against a journalist!  She should be prosecuted!,?

7631,from the article: "There's also no obvious source of cash for such an effort [to repeal changes to PF]  with the state's big businesses lined up in support of proposals to restructure the Permanent Fund." . Hmmm  so "big business" is in favor of reducing PFDs  of course it is  why is that?  I think it is because "big business" is trying to keep its corporate tax rates from being increased; so far it's been successful   I have seen no public discussion of raising (or auditing) corporate tax rates in Alaska.  The only options to increase state revenues I've seen discussed are those that impact citizens: income tax  sales tax and raiding the Permanent Fund.  When will we wake-up to what is really going on?,?
7632,Unite Here Local 5  have argued that vacation rentals deprive union workers of good-paying union jobs and benefits. Well sorry about that.   Unions refuse to understand it is not government's responsibilit to ensure there are union jobs. USA is based on capitalism  market decides on where the jobs are  what they pay. Exactly why there is very little manufacturing done in the Nei. Too expensive. Fight for $15 has actually resulted in less jobs.  Unions also fail to understand escalating wages increases automation as companies and business must cut operational costs. Expect many jobs to go away over the years  replaced by self serve kiosks  etc.  New world. Deal with it.,?

7637,I have young working parent friends at those constitutional first amendment rallies; and since they are not wealthy parents  they have their pre-school children with them.  Yours is a pretty unthinking  Trumplike comment - what is scary he will have the power and already has the mentality to do just what you would sadistically want to occur. I guess Constitutional rights don't matter very much to you?,?
7638,I think the clerk was kind and courteous in that she offered every way possible for the non-member - who had no rights or standing with the club - to pay the bill but it didn't work out.  The clerk could not turn a private club into a public store just to accommodate that one person.,?

7641,Trump's new Nickname is  "Bull shit Trump" . Reference CNN Fareed Zakaria's GPS program on Dec 11th.  The new name is very fitting. I am sure Trump would love it as he has Nicknames for every one that opposes him. I challenge you to start calling him by this name.,?

7666,This is precisely why Liberal claims of returning manufacturing jobs are just hot air. Manufacturing may be coming back  but the jobs aren't.   People didn't lose their manufacturing jobs to Mexicans. They lost them to robots. That's reality.  It's time for the unions to accept that and stop trying to force all governments from guaranteeing them a living. We don't need any more blacksmiths. Move on to a new career that someone values. The Anchor is right  automation isn't necessarily a bad thing. But it does force people to change  and to adapt.  Of course  Liberals are so deeply in bed with the unions they will say anything for a vote. Don't fall for it.,?

7672,your post makes no sense economically.  Why should a person not be able to deduct their loss at 100%?  you want them to pay income tax on money they did not make?  weird.  Non residents often have very good reason to own homes in other cities - this is not a black and white issue.  And finally your worst blunder is this: city-wide increases in property values do NOT increase property taxes.  The cities use a mill rate based on municipal expenditure - you only pay your same portion of the expenditure no matter how much property values rise or fall.  The ONLY thing affecting property taxation collectively is municipal spending  period.  In fact  the explosion in construction usually means the new homes pay more taxes than the older ones  saving you money.,?
7673,agree with your co-workers because everyone needs to have the same views on everything....being an individual is now out!

First  anyone who knows that his refugee application will most likely be rejected can simply go underground - with Montreal and other cities declaring themselves ''sanctuary cities'' (i.e. they will not cooperate with immigration authorities)  they will stay here indefinitely. Also  send them back where? To the US? The US is not obliged to accept anyone who is not an American citizen. What if the migrant arrives without documentation and there's no way of verifying where he's from? What if his country of origin refuses to take him back? That is the problem German authorities faced with the Tunisian who attacked the Christmas market last year - he had committed several crimes and Germany tried to deport him  but Tunisia refused to take him back because he had a criminal record in that country.,?
7701,Screw you DD. I do know the difference. Pretty much in the same vein as Magic Liger. I don't have to prove jack s*** to you  nor those like you. Get back under the porch.,?
7702,Sure he did you bumbling buffoon.,?
7703,I hope that both of these animals serve very long sentences behind bars  however  if the past sentences handed down by the courts are any indication they will serve less than 10 years total. When you are a drug dealer sometimes you end up meeting and dealing with trash.,?
7704,Butts "advises" Trudeau and Bannon tries to control Trump. Different ideologies but similar positions are held by both. Butts keeps Trudeau away from Ottawa doing selfies and Bannon solidifies his alt-right position in the White House. Without his notes Trudeau is lost. Question Period is a disgrace. Things got out of control with Trump's Charlottesville statements when he eventually mentioned the KKK and the neo-Nazis but Bannon's teaching/control became evident on Tuesday when Trump free-lanced his remarks. Both Butts and Bannon as un-elected individuals have too much influence.,?
7705,Don't pay attention to this crap Donny. It's not like you took your family to Paris  or London  or Amsterdam or Italy for a vacation  as one or two legislators did  and billed the state for it. Folks won't call that "entitlement." They'll just smile along with the world travelers. Especially if they come from Anchorage.,?

7709,Well  Trump is a bigot  as courts have determined  and he pardons a bigot  who violated the constitution.  Will the Trump catfish defend him?    They will  because they love garbage.,?
7710,Funny how Harper never figured out how to balance a budget in almost ten years  eh  Jeff?,?
7711,that's not true  and you are entitled to your delusions. As for being proud to be a liberal bigot who knows no shame  that's expected  just as it is expected from your political twin  the racist bigot.,?

7715,What a completely perverse  cynical and lying statement to make! It serves only to boost his support in the armed and dangerous community. Surely by this point  there must be an awful lot of Americans who have had it with mass shootings in the US and the inherent danger of just walking down the street or having dinner in some areas - now they're not even safe in church. And it's not because of those boogeyman Muslim terrorists  it's because of their fellow Americans with heavy weaponry and mean dispositions!,?
7716,buffer....blah blah blah. stupid hunters...blah blah blah.....junk science...blah blah blah. just another rant from a liberal to largely ignore.,?
7717,I lived in Anchorage for almost 38 years before moving to Boise  Idaho. Soon after arriving in Boise  Uber started up on a trial basis. Several months later service was suspended. After making some adjustments  Uber was again given approval to operate in Boise and has been operating ever since (over 2 years). The key benefactors of this decision has been the people who use it....okay  Uber makes out alright too. Why?  first the public has been given another option. Uber  in Boise and other places I've use it  is substantially less expensive than taxis. Uber will inevitably be shorter times from initial request to pick up time than a taxi. Anyone that says Uber drivers aren't screened is mistaken  potential drivers have their driving record checked out  if there is any criminal background as well as any history of being on any sexual offenders list. Are the background checks perfect?  no. But I would like to see the ratio of "bad apples" of Uber drivers compared to that of taxi drivers.,?

7719,Say what you will but NDP = Commy/Leftist socialists who will bleed you dry and leave the Province in a shambles. It has been shown time and again  whether in Ontario  Saskatchewan  Alberta or BC. Simply put a large number of people in BC are idealistic fools who can't see past there own noses and won't put the welfare of the people first - which means creating jobs for the unemployed. BC is full of selfish narcissistic children.,?
7720,the disaster?  We are richer than ever.  Look at the # of cars  devices and other goodies we have in our apartments and homes.  While some may have less (and that would be a very  small number vs what they had in the early 70s)  we are much better off.  You think we would be better off by deporting people who don't look like you?  And really  what do you think Trump is going to do differently?  Obama deported a whole bunch of people (look it up).  And by tweeting about where companies invest  he is interfering in the market place.  So  other than being racist and misogynistic in his speech  what redeeming qualities does he have that Canada needs?,?

7730,Taking $1 000 from each Alaskan gives the Republican Majority an additional $730 000 000.00 that they turn around and give to big oil in tax credits and gas line money.  It is THAT SIMPLE. Republicans are stealing our money to give to big oil so big oil gives them donations to win the next election so they can steal our money and continue to pay themselves about $20 000.00 a month and have a glass palace to sit in for the other 9 months. End this idiocy. Vote the monsters out!,?
7731,Larry  your piece seems uncharacteristically optimistic.  Agreed that it is a sign of hope that Tillerson is neither bat$hit crazy nor the over privileged son-in-law of some potentate  but the man is “a strategist who has run top-level GOP campaigns for three decades.”    Translation?

7753,Where is your proof of this charlie890: "Most of the press reported a lower number..."?  You must be very quick to have done a thorough review of the coverage given by thousands of press sources to have determined that "most" reported inaccurately.  Certainly some may have reported a lower number  but I simply don't believe your "alternative fact".,?

What you haven't figured out is that you are the perfect candidate for Fox News lapdog of the year.

Hence Trump !!!! Deal with lefty.,?
7759,At least with increased fines  those that are found in violation are the ones being burdened to shore up the deficits incurred by the lack of governing skills (and backbone to actually serve the people) from our elected officials.

7765,Trump is a bully. All bullies are cowards. They are liable to explode at any time so as to create an impression of toughness. Trump and Putin are on the same page  just like Hitler and Stalin were  initially. We all know what happened from there. In the White House a groper and in the Kremlin a man who boasts about his nation's whores. Connect the dots and be very scared.,?
7766,It's my opinion  my feeling  that Trump and his asinine administration  is the start of an ideology that will end in global conflict should he stay in power.  There is nothing behind the man's eyes. He's puppet-like and being treated like a toddler. Offending democrats and the media? Really  that is the least of our concerns.,?

Let's see the Antifa groups counter rally the WhiteRacists podium of Free Speech. They melt and show the Physical violence of their weak minds. We'll ALL see in time  what Trump said is the Truth  He doesn't condone Racists or Hate Groups or Violence. He'll arrest all those involved disrupting Free speech with physical violence. Typical Milinnials  Liberal Democatic ways of doing things  if they don't agree they'll use physical force to shut you down. CHANGE the Laws! Your Politicians are doing YOU a Disservice not dealing with the problem. Think about it  the authorities giving the White-Racist a permit for a Rally. It's the American right to free speech although of Racist views! Go get a permit and Rally another day  you don't have to confront them which will turn into violence This is not American way!

7792,"we spend more both public and personal money on healthcare than many other 1st world countries".  Many other?

The public spending on health care per capita in the US is about 52% of the total spending  compared to an average of 77% for 14 western European countries.  US spending might be more  but only because total spending is a lot more.  Total (public and private) spending on health care per capita in the US is over twice the total spending in those European countries.  In fact  in 6 of those countries  total health care spending is less than $4 195.  http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.75,?

7799,Your post is incoherent.  You write:  "I don't know that you can afford to see the similarities."  Between what and what?  Oh.  The similarity between: a) a statute that punishes a man for having orgasmic sex with a woman when he doesn't want a child and b) a statute that punishes a man for abandoning a child he's fathered?  Much as we both abhor fornication --- actually  I doubt that you do --- what meaningful similarity is there between the two statutes?  Suppose the man who doesn't want the child at the time he has sex later realizes that since he fathered the child  now he must support it. You would send him to jail --- even if he supports the child --- simply because he didn't want the child at the time of the sex act?  But you wouldn't punish a woman who not only didn't want a child when she had sex  but later aborted?  Nuts.  You also say:  "Women who have sex can get pregnant and not even remotely get a biological bang out of it."  You have a low opinion of womanhood.,?
7800,That one night stand you had 25 years ago  in fact you have forgotten about? She is about to become your worst nightmare. "Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned." She is going to name you  ruin your career  brake up your marriage  bankrupt you  make public enemy number one  your face will addorn newspaper front pages  sympathy seekers will suddenly recall other things "connected" to uou dastardly deed. My advice to any man going on a date  take your lawyer with. Cosby and Hewitt was found guilty after detailed evidence by an unbiased court of law in accordance with millenium old legal principles. Furguson must also take her case to court. We cannot allow conviction by public opinion. Can you remember where you were 19 September 1993? If you cannot you in deep shit.,?
7801,Cognitive dissonance is the opportunity to try to make sense of two seemingly impossible ideas that you hold simultaneously. Similar to the idea that true intelligence is the ability to hold two conflicting ideas at the same time and still be able to think. We all want our government to do the impossible...govern lightly. But the conservatives have made this impossible  no taxes  undermine the ideals and vision for making things better. Even when they get better  we have some successes  not always by government action  they undermine these as inconvenient. Crime rates have gone down  damn  can't be true. We retrain displaced workers who have lost their jobs  never. We love our troops but won't fund the VA. We need jobs but won't fund infrastructure. If conservatives have their way Flint's water will be all our water. They want to privatize prisons  why not police? It's all about winning at all costs and not about being responsible...such is a child's view of the world.,?

7811,The Maple Leaf flag became our flag on February 15  1965. The Red Ensign was a symbol of a British colony. It was resented by our French speaking citizens and non British immigrants.

"The Maple Leaf our emblem dear" was an expression from the anthem "the Maple Leaf Forever".,?

7817,I think you have it backwards.    Harper had a hate-on for the press because he lacked the skills to deal with them.   Every previous PM (Liberal and Conservative) had their issues with the press.    Only Harper played perpetual "victim".  Harper came under the same scrutiny that any Canadian leader faces.    He also had the same fawning press when he first took power.     He was just too inept to take advantage of it.,?

7839,The Last Truthbender writes:  "and yet the press took it allllll in and never questioned the motives of these "top aides"  --  What do their motives have to do with anything?  If Trump was taking direction from Moscow then America should know about it.  They did the right thing.  And their motivation was that it was the "right thing" to do.  You're just cranky because Trump got caught.  Once again  you're trying to shoot the messenger and hoping to hide the message.,?

7842,“I want my community to know that politicians do not get to decide who is deserving of dignity and who is not ” Catalina Santiago  a DACA recipient arrested in Tuesday’s action  said in a statement.  “DACA is under attack while my parents  who are farmworkers  were never even given the temporary protection DACA provides.   I am getting arrested today to tell my parents  my community  and the rest of the 11 million that no matter what politicians say  you are worthy and we will not settle for the crumbs they offer us in exchange for being the economic and labor force that sustains this country day in and day out.”   https://thinkprogress.org/texas-daca-arrested-3e877c8f6419,?

7845,Your question is obviously different than the primary topic  which is liability in the case where someone owns a tree and knows it is damaged or unhealthy and likely to cause injury or property damage.  During ice storms  even healthy branches and trees can fall. When this occurs  it is legally the same as other incidental matter like leaves  small branches  and needles falling from trees throughout the year.  If you live in Eugene  the city will clear fallen trees blocking the road. Beyond that  if branches fell on your property or sidewalk  cleanup is your responsibility  regardless of whose trees they came from.,?

7854,I think he may be being underestimated here.  A lot of people are judging him on his "reality" TV personality.  I'm going on a limb here and suggesting that he may have been playing the bad guy for ratings.  I haven't seen enough of his debates yet  but he dose at least seam to have some good debate skills.   As for TLC being built up on rapid acquisitions  it's a common practice in traded companies and almost always ends in a flop  but retail investors jump on these and many investment "analysts" promote these.  They have to know the goodwill will be written off at some time  but they look at the massive increases in the book value and get excited.  That he sold this sucker to Mattel is being portrayed as a negative is hardly that.  This is Mattel's mess up.  He can sell.  I suspect he can turn on the charm when he needs to and if he can sell Canada  without selling it out  he may get my vote.,?
7855,Immoral? You mean like Chinese parents drowning or starving their own daughters due to preference for males? You mean like Chinese skinning animals alive and seemingly enjoying it? You mean like Chinese government oppression of the wonderful Tibetan people? You mean idiotic  superstitious beliefs about magic potions that have led many species to the brink of extinction? Warped culture  warped minds.  And what's with the Chinese spitting everywhere? It's another example of the grotesque culture.  Btw there's nothing "racist" about opposing a particular culture.,?

7859,ad1>  As I have said......do what you must.   I do tend to get offended when someone attacks my integrity  my intelligence  and my offer to make peace.  Instead of the constant bickering that goes back and forth why can't we strategize on how we can make our govt better.  I guess there's no fun in doing that  right?   So  continue with your wise a_s responses and have at it.  BTW does it really matter whether I have a good answer or response to your posts?  For all it's worth.  The immigrant word to that is "NADA."  You are a fun person  and this is an assumption on my part.,?
7860,This is a very scary practice that is becoming all too popular in Canadian politics. It is called buying votes using other peoples money that is taken from the successful people in our society. This thrives on the opinion that nobody should be allowed to have any more than me and if they do take the extra from them and divided it among the rest of us. Unfortunately this kills motivation for people to take risks - since your not allowed to have more than me. It has clearly been shown that neither communism nor extreme socialism have succeeded in other societies and they won't work for Canada. England's Thatcher hit the nail on the head when she stated that the problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other peoples money.,?

7866,The Task Force examined 30 000 submissions AND wrote a report - all in less than 3 months ? Really ? So much for "...slowly  and deliberately..." And how about that conflict of interest with the Task Force Chair? Clearly  her firm's clients will reap enormous financial benefits from the recommendations of this report. Is a blatant conflict of interest really okay as long as it is declared - after the report is written and recommendations made ? Interesting way of doing thing this Canadian government has adopted. Mr Trump may come a-calling - looking for a mentor.,?
7867,The problem with that pool is that it will be a maintenance nightmare very soon  if not now. Bethel does not have the trained people locally to maintain that pool equipment.  That money would have been much better spent on a indoor fitness/rock climbing/gymnsatics gym.  Something that the locals can maintain and can be easily modified in the future for other activities. I'll give it 10 years and the pool will be closed because it will be far too expensive to fly people in to fix anything. I know you had great intentions with pushing that pool  Beverely. But you guys could have got way more bang for the buck.,?
7868,It's incredible that anyone would use the word "reality" in defense of Donald Trump.  Even his erstwhile supporters must know by now that he's nuts.  Surely they must be worried about that.  If not  it's they who need the reality check.,?

7871,I went through a similar experience as the author's with sepsis  especially the deep  troubling hallucinations while semi comatose in the early stages.  When I started to become aware after a couple of weeks in ICU  it dawned on me that what I'd experienced was wonderfully rendered by Dennis Potter in the Singing Detective.  The original British TV show especially captured the hallucinatory journeys of the protagonist. It was a very weird experience.,?
7872,Trump deserves to be poked in the eye and bopped in the head quite often for being a horrible person and racist and it is amusing that Pope Francis seems to enjoy doing it so much.,?
7873,Come on  you expect to registered (D)onkey voters whom voted in the dumbest politicians in the entire nation to actually think the rest of us are as gullible as they are? LOL,?
7874,LOL. ADN readers snuff out any Hillary opinions. Kaine looked like a fool. Can I say that?,?
7875,..... and many times over the 'poorly educated' this guy loves so much.... (Fox News viewership that is),?
7876,OK. Going to say it again  as the first one got deleted for a less than civil comment  really?  Any individual that cites race  or culture  within their own commentary  as an opposition  is  well  racist.  We  all of us individuals  mind you  regardless of race (does not exist)  culture  beliefs  ideology  etc.  want the same thing  and that is the following.  Life  the ability to live ones life  without harming other individuals  and to be left alone in which to do so.  Liberty  the ability to go on with said life  and to speak  and act  as one wishes  should they not be harmful unto another individual or group.  Freedom  the ability to stand outside the controlling racist  bigoted  and misogynistic policies  of our own Government  who wish nothing but to control us based upon whatever group that we happen to belong unto within order to support their own divisive  and controlling nature so as to keep their own power and influence.  The Government  et al  is the problem  not solution.,?
7877,Well done Tanisha.  I was born and raised in Astoria and maintain contact with friends and have a house there even though I live 50 miles up river.  I am in my mid 60s and have a large memory bank of what the town was like before the fishing industry collapsed back in the 70s.  I am a retired engineer and find myself in Astoria often and am in contact a large number of former and current Astorians through my Facbook account.  Your assessment of what one may expect to find in the local taverns and town (minus the tourist) in general I find to be quite accurate.,?
7878,Now you are getting ridiculous .  I don't have to "submerge" myself into anything to breathe.  Yes  we and plants need water as well as food to survive.  But that is to "survive."  Without Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide we wouldn't need them because we be unconscious in a minute and dead a minute later.  We don't have to "think" to breathe  it comes naturally  starting somehow in our mothers' wombs  and definitely when when we are born and "take our first breath."  Read my post to Neko  below.  It supports my position in this argument we are having about the authenticity of the science presented by climate change believers.,?
7879,Funny  very few on the left were calling for investigations of Bush.  There were a handful  but Obama and Pelosi made it clear that those investigations weren't going anywhere  so you are comparing apples to cars  or something equally ridiculous.,?

7882,Ok.... Listen up  over-the-hill Boomer dinosaurs.   NO ONE will be able to maintain these silly structures that you are building as a testimonial to your own inflated sense of self-importance.

7885,What I would love to know is how child labour is defined. It seems pretty critical to the credibility of the report. UNISEF has used the following in the past. By their definition most ambitious Canadian children mowing neighbors lawns  being paid an allowance for family chores or working at fast food restaurants would qualify.  Child labour – Percentage of children aged 5 to 14 years of age involved in child labour activities at the moment of the survey. A child is considered to be involved in child labour activities under the following classification:   (a) children 5 to 11 years of age that during the week preceding the survey did at least one hour of economic activity or at least 28 hours of domestic work  and  (b) children 12 to 14 years of age that during the week preceding the survey did at least 14 hours of economic activity or at least 42 hours of economic activity and domestic work combined.,?

7896,Yup  reading  words  books  whatever...takes time away from watching television and dictating tweets...the GOP elected this idiot and we will all pay the costs. No actually the disinterested voters elected him by not caring  after being told that elections don't matter...this is how conservatives win  turn off voters  suppress voters  make us want to take a shower after Rush and Faux. The it wasn't based on income  that meme is dead  538 says it was education...skills and knowledge that differentiated little d's voters from Hillary's. So we are in for it now...thanks to Obama we got our economic house in order  now come the trumpian economic fart bubble as we ramp up tax breaks  deregulate coal  and open the pollution floodgates. And we will all pay for this over the coming years  again...like the fact we don't pay for preventative health or drug treatment costs us all in the end. So let's put the blame squarely where it belongs...on Paul Ryan's lap. Stupid  stupid  stupid....,?

7906,Liberal supporters in the media are keening for Justin to mount his steed  ride west  and smite Brad Wall.  One guy at the CBC even enthused that Justin's carbon scheme was "the new medicare".  (should I look forward to reduced wait times for orthopedic surgery and chemo?)  In the absence of the discovery of a miracle fuel this scheme will serve to reduce incomes  depress the economy  and export jobs and industry.  Only economic alchemists would think otherwise.  Let's do a check-up in a couple of years when the media puff pieces are forgotten and the effects of this tax on everything are biting families hard.,?

I am not marching so much FOR anything as i am AGAINST TRUMP.  that's my motivation.  i probably won't even listen to the speakers..  it will be the same talk i've heard at different protests over the years. which is fine - younger folks will get a good earful of information.   and for any men who are gonna jump into this stories comments to be rude  disrespectful and ignorant (by god you are in the likeness of Trump) remember - .  Yo Mama is/was a woman.  Yo Mama provided food - perhaps direct from her own body. Yo Mama most likely cleaned your little fannies for 2 or years  while at the same time making sure there was food to shovel into hungry little mouth. Yo Mama protected you.  Yo Mama taught you letters... numbers....words... ideas..  Yo Mama got you to school the first day... waited for your school bus.

7920,"The facts are most of the consumption of deep fried food occurs in Black and Hispanic neighborhoods." Where's your evidence Harvey? Are Jews stingier? Blonds dumber? Mexicans violent rapists? I have a PhD Harvey but that's no guarantee of anything. Most of the time common sense is sufficient. When's the last time you went to a minority neighborhood to "observe the shape" of the inhabitants? Common sense says never. You don't need a PhD to look up "stereotype" Harvey.,?
7921,Saying that the this tax cut won't favor the rich is a pants-on-fire lie. How do they get away with it? Does ANYONE believe the tax cuts won't favor the rich? It's one thing to argue that rich people deserve 80% of the cut  but to say they don't benefit more than the "middle class" who may get $180 to $400 per year is just jaw-dropping. Trump alone would immediately save $32 million based on his 2005 tax return. His kids save an estimated $3.1 billion if his net worth statements are accurate. And  people should think about what we don't get with this tax cut: money to fix roads  bridges  dams  schools  airports  electrical grid  etc. America will crumble while the 400 richest families share almost a trillion dollars...which I'm sure they need desperately.,?
7922,oh bs you ignorant one  under torys  people prospered   and save the harper eggs bs  more left wing lies    oil was and is our blood of the economy  funny you ignore the billions he helped with the auto sector in ontario eh loser!    the ndp have made the times harder and lasting longer!   the tory's understand the economy  the ndp only want to tax it,?
7923,So you acknowledge that gender equality happened. That is it. But you don't acknowledge that it happened by default because everyone unequal was either exterminated or left for dead. Convenient. If that's what you call smart then I can't argue with that. But it's wronger than wrong.  Speaking of not being an idiot  you might want to brush up on what survivorship bias means.,?
7924,It won't happen.  Best case  they would kill PERA and raise salaries by a tiny bit.  My wife works for the state in a very low level management role.  It takes an act of the legislature to change salaries or to even hire a full time employee.  What that means  is that free market forces can't work here.  If a manager can't find an employee at the wages offered  it will take going to the legislature  while they are in session  to get a shot at a higher pay rate.  What will end up happening is that this jobs will stay unfilled for months or longer  all the while  service suffers.  Those on the right who truly hate government will use that poor service as an example of why government is so bad  and push to cut it further.  It will end up as nothing but a feedback loop where service is cut due to poor service  which will cut service even more.  The changes that would be needed are more than I can see our state doing.,?

7930,OH  come on  do you not understand sarcasm?  Unless the Russians are really stupid which I don't think they are  they were playing both sides of this political game.   Only people who mindlessly believe what candidates or their surrogates say and do can be influenced by another country or lies or biases or selective memory.  It's not like the U.S. ever meddles in the elections of other countries!  Hahaha!  Still  I do wonder how either side would have gotten ahold of my ballot.,?

7939,Owning human beings is immoral just like the example I gave about pedophilia.  Being American dude just doesn't cut it  lol.  Being an American and a pedophile doesn't justify an immoral behavior.  Sorry you don't like my example but w/extreme closed minded folks such as you've demonstrated time and time again.........you're either way too stupid or weak to admit your argument just doesn't cut it.  So sad bud.  I'd hate to be related to you OR your loved ones have NO idea you talk this way.    Whew.,?
7940,Just remember this. For years  McCain crowed how ObummaCare needed to be repealed. Once the opportunity to actually repeal the crappy legislation comes up  McCain does a complete 180  just to try to obstruct any progress for Trump. That shows just how much of a traitor McCain is. Burn in hell McCain  burn in hell.,?
7941,Maui Memorial Medical Center is Joint Commission Accredited.  This means that the Medical Center must meet patient care  goals and standards of safety.  This is the only acute care hospital in Maui.  There is a cost to maintaining accreditation and  meeting current standards of practice  and required personnel.    Having a facility such as Maui Memorial Medical Center is a requirement for this community.  The state is doing its due diligence in ASSURING that Maui has this facility.  It does not need to PROVIDE the health services.,?

7959,If the belt couldn't be linked to the injuries  it's simply a her word vs his word. By the sounds of this scumbag  he likely is getting good at getting away with these type of crimes.,?
7960,Agreed. The notion that "something was in process" could be applied to almost anything. One could say the need to build the Berlin Wall meant is had to eventually come down.  People should review logical fallacies: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies,?

7967,I mean lets face it  They say only the good die young.  If true Hill-larious has many years left. If Hillary gets off the campaign trail  America will be better for it!  I think she needs an old folks home where she can rest and yell at the top of her lungs all she wants about Americans being deplorable if they are not leftist useful idiots.,?
7968,We at the Attachment & Trauma Network are so proud that Tiffany is being honored as an Angel in Adoption.  Like Jason  we're not surprised!  She has such devotion to helping parents of traumatized children understand how their parenting has to become more trauma-informed - more whole-hearted and whole-brained.  Thanks Tif for all you do for children and families through ATN  through Kitsap Strong and all of your advocacy and volunteer efforts!,?

7970,I am sure they are going to come out in droves.  You can't be gay and be conservative.  You can't be gay and be weary of so-called multiculturalism.  You can't be gay and have any opinion that doesn't parrot what some liberal mouthpiece is blabbering.  It is time for gays (and women) to say  Islam is a religion that hates us.,?

7974,Wow..totally disgusting that this creep got such a lenient sentence. Rapists should be sentenced to life in prison and chemically castrated...and a lobotomy would be a nice idea  too.,?
7975,There is just one problem: most of the people who claim to want to be able to think for themselves don't know how to think.  How can people think for themselves when they don't know how to think?  I have accepted the truths taught by the Magesterium precisely because I am thinking for myself.  I don't just fall for pithy bumper sticker slogans. Church teaching cannot be reduced to clever little bumper sticker slogans or protest signs.,?

7977,Two things #1 I am answering the off topic remark you pulled out of thin air 🙃 and obviously don't know what you are talking about. If it is such a big problem then explain why all climatologists agree human impact on global climate is no more than 4%? This hoax is a tail wagging the dog with emotional zealots spewing fact-free science!

7981,The Trudeau liberals are trying once again to fix a problem that doesn't need fixing. Canada does not have the extremes of wealth and poverty of the US.   He is tying to pass off tax credits targeted specifically  for the middle class as tax breaks for the wealthy. Seriously? Do you think the rich need a fitness tax credit or a tax credit for their bus pass? lol  These guys are morons.,?

7987,I agree Layla. Even before any legislation passes  under the current environment  a scientific researcher could be sitting on research that would win them a Nobel prize in science yet  if that work went against current PC ideology on the subject  theyd sit on it lest they be hounded out of their career by activists. Now they face that plus government action and it is shameful. They say Harper muzzled scientists but at least he didn't legislate a scientific conclusion onto a field of study that is often described as in its infancy and threaten anyone who disagrees with it with very punitive government action. Their scientific methodology is flawed and they know it yet are going ahead anyway  not because of lobbying but because of influence peddling,?
7988,Public sector workers en masse won't vote Conservative.  It's hilarious that private sector workers join them in voting Liberal and then complain about Canada's public sector aristocracy.,?

7995,We'll never stop violence entirely and life offers no guarantees  but I will say that these gun references are distorting the issue. The elephant in the room is the use of pharmaceutical drugs for depression  anxiety etc. - the psychotropic mind drugs. They Cause violent behavior and also Suicide in young users. They've been banned in many countries but greatly enrich American drug companies and have duped (bought) our Congress into absolving their makers from responsibility due to the harm they cause. Law suits for harm and death by legal drugs  paid for by the Taxpayer  have cost us almost 3 Billion dollars. Still  the drug makers claim vaccines and the like cause No harm? (Not to them!) And our government threatens to Force us to take them? Over 90% of mass murders have been committed by people using these "safe" money makers  yet guns get all the blame. As for gun confiscation  over 100 million unarmed subjects  have been slaughtered by their own governments. Be a wise citizen.,?
7996,Right.  Those damned affluent white people should only eat their own food  like cod cakes and boiled potatoes.  No enchiladas for them!,?

7999,Nicely done Nicholas!  Do you suppose there are still Trump supporters out there who will try to defend such a  jerk after reading all this?,?
8000,These people are supporters of authoritarianism.  They feel a strong need for order  clear simple solutions to complicated problems.  Their religious teachings values respecting elders over independence  obiedience over self-reliance and good manners over curiosity.  Like other countries Turkey is split into rural/urban  educated elites versus hoards of uneducated believers.  Erdogan  has taken in more than 2 million Syrian refugees and these are not the elites of Syria.  One Turkish commentator speculated Erdogan did this since he knows these newcomers would support his values.  In my neighborhood I've met at 5 young men (one woman) from wealthy Turkish families who are studying here and have no intention of going back.  They are well aware of what Erdogan is doing and appear to have given up on their country.   They know they are becoming outnumbered by those who crave a dictatorship and who only want for their children is what is outlined in their holy book.  Human stupidity  yes.,?

8012,Small countries with relatively homogenous populations  cultures and geographies and a lack of ready alternatives are more susceptible to co-operative gestures inherent in high taxation and high social services.   Canada is different - massive  diverse and right next door to the USA  and we don't tolerate high taxes nearly as well.  We just run up debt instead! But we're talking about public toilets here Artie  and if you visited Sweden  Finland  the Netherlands and Denmark  you'd discover that they pay. So please  if you want a nanny state  or a diaper state  please go find one  but not on my dime.,?
8013,Rik some people violate the law and go to jail as a punishment. Other people get sent to jail as a favor. We are doing them a favor because they are too stupid  too mean and too angry to stop trying to kill themselves and take as many of the rest of us with them  as they can  when they go.,?

8019,Disingenuous or just not well informed? Global pricing was one part of the problem  PET crushed many of the barely surviving small and mid sized companies by tacking NEP on top of a beaten down industry. Entirely in the interests of central Canada and at the expense of an already suffering province. His statements at the time were pretty clear that he was willing to throw Alberta and other related parts of western Canada under the bus.  My father spent a good deal of that time out of work thanks to a ferociously partisan and misguided attempt at command economics  to benefit one part of the country over another.,?
8020,Your problem is that you only see racist white men  which means you're racist against white men.,?
8021,Nat forgot Bill Walker also hired lobbyists!  Walker tells everyone there's no more money  but he paid for expensive lobbyists who paraded as 'consultants' under contract to pressure legislators and others even though he already has highly paid staff who deal with the legislators.     Couple that with the ubiquitous lack of accountability inherent in the Walker/Mallott administration which resulted in a prominent lobbyist who billed the state for questionable meetings that he eventually was paid for a couple of months later after an 'investigation' was done.  Consultant to Gov. Walker appears to have billed for 'phantom' meetings http://www.adn.com/politics/article/governors-office/2016/01/30/  Ordinary Alaskans are outdone when moneyed individuals  like GCI and the Dispatch owner  have unfettered access to Walker.   http://www.adn.com/politics/article/alaska-gov-walker-rallies-business-leaders-others-support-fiscal-plan/2015/10/10/  The politics of corruption continues...unabated.,?

8024,Good. I hope it finally happens. I live about 2 blocks from the tracks and no  it wasn't an option to live somewhere else and it isn't an option to move. This is actually a good place to live if we can get rid of the train horns  which are very disruptive. I've lived with them for over ten years but would be quite happy to live without them. The crossing bells that someone mentioned are inaudible from where I live and don't bother me.   This seems to be one of the very few times when the business people and I are on the same side. The Obie development near the 5th Street Market will include HACSA subsidized housing  if they ever work it out with the county to lease the land. There is a great need for such housing. The current waiting list is years long.  I doubt that silencing the train horns will affect Whiteaker rents but if they really believe that perhaps they could opt out. I don't live in their neighborhood.,?

8034,Most of them will play injured - even with pain  i.e. Jake McGee  2016.  Jeff Francis and others also have hurt the team by doing it.  The reason is that they are afraid that if they go away to heal  someone else will take their place and they'll never be invited back.  Doesn't matter if it hurts their team  they do it anyway because it usually benefits them.  They get another day of MLB service tacked onto their record (as Huey often points out  it's important for their retirement benefits).  From their perspective I can see it - but it's bad for baseball.,?

8039,If they're "covering their costs" then any future such projects should not charge their participants  assuming these are durable hand tools which should last many years  if not a lifetime. Electrical tools such as saws and drills do wear out eventually but given the high cost quoted it's likely they could afford quality brands which often last contractors decades. This sounds like the agency has set itself up as a rental company to profit off the people it's ostensibly helping. I'd like to see a list of the tools they provide to be able to cost them out by purchasing them outright. Having done all phases of construction  from foundations to finish work  it sounds like they overpaid. In any case  the tools are now paid for  and shouldn't be charged for again.,?

8041,Margaret Stock might have a nice bio  but then so did Joe Miller.  On the other hand  Lisa's bio shows she's walked the walk in Alaska.  Lisa is a third generation Alaskan who has lived in Ketchikan  Juneau  Anchorage and Fairbanks and visited with Alaskans in all corners of the state multiple times.  Her husband has owned a small business for years and just recently her son has taken it over.    More importantly  she has proven to be effective as our Senator.  Murkowski has sponsored bills with Democrats like Barbara Boxer and Al Franken as well as Republicans like Mike Lee and John Cornyn that have become law.  She led with Senators Ayotte and Collins to end the government shutdown.  She understands what projects and programs in Alaska need and deserve federal funding and she fights successfully to bring it home.,?

8049,This meeting between Francis and the Commission PERFECTLY frames the problem.  That team has been working for 3 years.  Only after the victims have left the group  does the pope deem the group worthy of his time.  And once again  words  words  words...  This problem IS solvable.  While there will likely always be people with the pedophilia sickness (for lack of a better word)  the response of the church can and must be better.    Francis has consumed the kool-aid.  He refers to the problem in remote terms (a "delayed response " "consciences asleep")  he still lacks the emotional understanding.  When he realizes that a beloved grand niece  or the pride and joy son of a very close friend have committed suicide because they were abused  and had to live with that for years when nobody would believe or help them  THEN maybe there could be a break through.  But for now  this is just one more "show piece."  If  he were serious  he'd have been meeting with the Commission regularly for 3 years.,?

When in Afghanistan and seeing grown men have sex with young boys and goats after maghrib it's pretty difficult not to judge.  When their 'prophet' and founder Mohammed married a 6 year old and was screwing her by 10 years of age  respect is hard to come by  I don't like pedophiles.

8087,I didn't realize that an awareness of the danger of corporate money in politics was publicly discussed that far back.  We didn't learn a thing  did we?,?

8089,Sick little monsters - hope they all suffer the way their victim did.,?
8090,It's so much fun watching the Clinton media choke as they try to explain how they blew it. Even if trump eventually loses its worth seeing. What is not funny is watching these idiots on ABC say trump is winning because of uneducated white people. Funny I thought Oregon voted for Hillary.,?
8091,Okay  I'll bite.  No need  your approach.  Cigarette smokers buy their cigarettes with the money they earn  for the most part  they do not feed their habit by breaking in to my car to steal my stereo  into my office to steal my computer  into my house to steal my TV  or by spreading venereal diseases and AIDS all over my city by selling their bodies and sharing needles.  That alone says that things like tobacco and things like heroin need to be thought of in different categories.,?
8092,So your argument is that Trump is literally stupid  too stupid to look at the existing election voter retgistration/control process and understand how it works?  Too stupid to look at the audits conducted after the elections - audits where States go through the voting participation data and re-verify that there was no double voting etc.,?
8093,Kiz is essentially the Tebow-of-the-newsroom at DP... why they keep him is a mystery to everyone who still bothers to read DP,?
8094,Obama should keep his mouth shut and stop trying to stir up trouble  for Trump  abroad. He is on the way out and should stop slandering the incoming President; with lies and accusations  that may turn out to be false. Stop being a hypocrite Mr. President! And STOP  using reverse psychology on President Trump  by telling your ponies  to post signs in bathrooms and other signs of white supremacy. Painting President Trump as a racist. Th President brownie's are doing this  to put the blame on Trump's supporters. Whom the brownies hate. Stop with the lies  using your temporary position to turn other Nations against Trump. To incite hated for him and his policies. He will be a good President  maybe even a great one. Burke WWII  Korea  Nam Vet.,?

8103,Character or intelligence  no. But one can certainly assume certain values when people make a point of "making a statement" with their distinctive clothing  particularly political or religious.

8105,There is no proof and there isn't going to be any.  The SEX Offender Registries are idiotic social policy that experts never supported. They knew that the SORs would be counterproductive and that they are not needed at all in order to protect anyone. If a person is going to protect his/herself and/or his/her children  then they have to protect from ALL people. Once they've done that  they have no need at all for a very  very incomplete list from Nanny Big Government (NBG) of people who did something bad long ago  often decades ago. If they don't do that  they can read their SORs all day and night and they will not have added any protection for anyone.  But for the NBG lovers who support the SORs - how is it even conceivable that you have so massively failed to get the rest of your NBG Registries created? No Gun Offender Registry? Wow. I guess you don't care about children after all.  People who support the SORs are not Americans and they don't care about facts.,?
8106,So you think we don't monitor the conversations of foreign nationals? Is that the basis of your argument?   Trump's claim that Trump Tower was wiretapped is absurd. If his staff is too stupid to figure out our intelligence services are monitoring the conversations of foreign agents his entire administration is inept. That's the job of our intelligence services: If you're talking to foreign agents  it's best to assume their conversations are being monitored.  If they're not  I'd get me a new intelligence service...,?

Everyone makes great points  but until we as a collective community rise up and let them know we're not taking this bs venting on Star Advertiser is not going to change anything.

8114,What a disgusting person - putting party over the needs of his constituents in Colorado.  Voting on a bill which he admits he hasn't even read yet (8 pages  written by McConnell on a napkin over lunch) with no regard as to the effects on Colorado is just plain evil.  All Jesus did was talk about healing the sick and yet these Republican "Christians" want to throw poor folks to the wolves.  Fine  fix the ACA but don't throw it out with NOTHING to replace it with.  Just sad.,?
8115,Do you know the priest personally or are you simply relying on this article and the usual personal attacks on various prelates and priests from the usual sources?,?
8116,"…the President said in a weekend tweet that his putative Republican allies looked “like fools”"  Yup  as always Trump takes no responsibility for anything. The mark of a real fool.,?
8117,BC has the strongest economy in Canada and a balance sheet that would make every other province blush with envy. The Liberals aren't perfect but the alternative is a job-killing embarrassment (read their agreement). The last time the NDP were in power they were rewarded with two whole seats as a reflection of job well done  go figure.  The Greens are siding with US-funded protesters threatening "direct action" on BC's infrastructure and the NDP ran a campaign of hostility against the private sector - which is why jurisdictions that rely on natural resources were virtually swept by the Liberals. The Greens are unapologetic naive idealists and the NDP and government unions are one in the same. Horgan stood side-by-side with the leader of the United Steelworkers who supports Trump's protectionism. Why is the NDP so afraid of another election? If they want a mandate  let voters give them one.,?

8124,Think the retirement age could stay at 65 years for CPP an OAS - keep the incentives/penalties in place for late  or early retirement. Also  the government should claw back OAS at lower income level  and even remove universality of OAS for wealthy seniors. I (recent senior) don't need it  and likely will just put it in a TFSA  so no stimulation  benefit to the economy.  The government should look at what is going on south of the border  where so many have been left behind in the "recovery" .It is also happening in Canada  although not yet to the same degree.  Income inequality is THE new issue of today  and the US is among the most unequal country in the world  and also includes  inequality of opportunity. (see "The Great Divide" - J. Stiglitz). As automation and autonomous vehicles transforms the workplace   there will be more unemployed  some can be retrained and reemployed if young enough  but many will not. Solutions?? A better social safety net for those affected workers.,?
8125,with a high priority for indigenous  environmental and gender equality demanded by Canada into NAFTA negotiations  to put it mildly we are screwed.,?
8126,Selling insurance across state lines has to be one of the least well understood health policy issues  by the public and policymakers alike...especially conservative ones.   I cannot believe the number of people who think that selling insurance across state lines would improve healthcare in this country. Additionally I can't believe the number of people who don't know that its already permissible and legal. Don't believe me? Then grab your copy of the Affordable Care Act and there in Section 1333 is where states can agree to “health care choice compacts” that would allow health insurance companies to sell their products across states lines.  Insurance companies don't do it because it's not profitable...and the only reason they're in the health insurance business is to make a profit.   People would do well in this country to reattach this instead of taking their healthcare talking points from talk radio.,?
8127,All we need is Cayetano to encourage  Trump not to give us a penny more for the rail and our tax for the rail will be extended about 3 more years. The thing is more than halfway complete. You think we are going to spend a few billion to tear it down. Cayetano is going to hurt us tax payers if Trump decides not to help pay for it. I didn't feel my wallet getting any less smaller from paying any extra tax. Cayetano  "stupid is as stupid is".,?

8130,The "useless council" was put together by your "useless Chump". Guess your useless head didn't figure that out.,?
8131,I sound like ...? You're ridiculous. You've made inferences about my character based on a couple of comments?  How about this? You're too scared to post here using your real name so you hide behind an anonymous moniker while you spew your stupidity while you work at the FCC. Come on chicken  post with your real name ... since you work at the FCC you can then tell us all the real story.  Few if any 21 year olds are capable of making nothing but well informed good decisions. A person's frontal lobes (the area of the brain responsible for "judgement") isn't fully developed until around the age of 25.   The state is responsible for those in it's custody. End of story. Discharging someone from your custody into the street isn't living up to that responsibility.,?

8135,Sanford: You make a great point regarding persons who seek power over others.  Some persons are able to fill such positions with humility  compassion and genuine concern for the community. Some use it to benefit themselves financially. Some use the power to advance a nefarious agenda.   Some just enjoy the Power.   I greatly enjoy Groucho Marx's comment that he'd "never join any club that would have him as a member." and  I've always felt the best politicians would be those who would never want to be politicians.  regards  Gary,?
8136,With all the issues we are facing in this country right now - fires  floods  lunatic leaders trying to provoke nuclear war  homelessness  poverty and people on the verge of losing their healthcare  the fact that people are so up in arms about something so trivial speaks volumes about the American people. We are petty  small  and silly. I mean  even if you force people to stand  you can't force what's in their hearts. If they are standing there rolling their eyes  thinking about what they are having for dinner  does it matter that they are standing? And since when has "being disrespectful" a crime? Why are people so dense that they don't understand that standing (or not) for a song has nothing to do with "the troops?" No  our problem is mass stupidity  not an anthem.,?

8139,Americans have no impulse control. We are a nation of hustlers  shingle salesmen  con men  swindlers  sexists  boasters  liars  cheaters and gross exaggerators. We value the glitz  the appearances  the show  the entertainment  the sex. But a nation of hustlers is also a nation of dupes  marks  suckers  victims. It’s okay. A one-word slogan will soothe the suckers’ fears. “Hillary.” As in  what about? As if she were as consummate a conman as the Trump. “Benghazi.” Lied about a video or something. “Emails.” Yeah  that was stupid. And finally...facts  authoritative documentation (as in this column) can be wiped away by chanting one of the suggested slogans. That’s why this nation of con men and con women is also a nation of fools.,?

8148,Is it plausible to believe that no one from the Clinton campaign ever met with the Russian Ambassador or Russian "operatives" eager to discuss or promote Russian policy?  Given the reset and the Russian bonuses that the "pay to play" Clintons and Podesta's received in the past  there must have been at least one meeting. What did Hillary  Fusion GPS  and the Russian lady lawyer have in common? They all lobbied against the Magnitsky legislation restricting Russian businesses associated with Putin associates. The law firm  Perkins Coie  hired Fusion GPS for the Clinton campaign  DNC (Clinton  Inc. controlled)  and the Obama administration. The Russian dossier was the a project to cook up  a conspiracy theory. The former head of Perkins Coie was Obama's White House Council.  Perkins Coie apparently handled and coordinated the investigation into the DNC email release and prevented the FBI from examining the DNC servers while promoting the Russian hacking story. Are Comey & Mueller pawns?,?

8150,You do know that a cartridge is a bullet  right? It would be slow going to replace cartridges individually. Although replacing a 14-cartridge magazine a few times would definitely go much easier. Carrying 10 cartridges (bullets) would hardly be noticeable. Carrying 10 magazines would definitely make a bulge in your jacket.  Just pointing out that you have NO understanding of the topic you're pontificating on  so maybe you should consider educating yourself before you lecture those who do know something about the topic as if they were idiots and you were the wise one.,?
8151,Hard to predict the future and wish we could soften opinions to wait and see. Opinion is just that  an opinion. I am trying a wait and see approach. Take Education for example. US education has fallen drastically over the years...i.e.  silly things that make you laugh but are not funny..65% of incoming Freshmen at U. Of Miami in Florida  could not find Florida on the map.  We have known serious changes in Education are needed and yet the very same players want to continue to remain in charge. I do know with confidence that if something isn't working to the degree US education is failing our chikdren   it needs more then a tweak. And if the usual players are hollering about the inadequacies about the newly appointed Secretary of Education  then I am all for change  maybe something good will come from this appointment. Being a change agent isn't popular but change is necessary when you compare where our students were ranked in the World and where they are now. We will all wait and see.,?
8152,Just leave them to the only weak argument they have. It's pathetic and absolutely hilarious at the same time. Racist  homophobic  xenophobic  islamophobic  bigot  facist  blah blah blah. Same garbage talking points as always.,?
8153,Good.  Each community should decide which government services they want to pay for.  Right now there are a lot of places paying nothing (no property or sales tax) yet consume more state dollars per person then the rest of us.,?
8154,This was not a military decision. There is no evidence that the military were at all involved in Trump's tweet. This was an unfounded  uninformed decision by the current buffoon in the White House.,?

8157,Earning rewards points is admittedly in a tax "grey area"  but if someone is earning that many points each year because of work  I think that CRA would consider it a taxable benefit.  If the rewards are nominal  they are generally considered non-taxable.  If they are not nominal (1 million per year is clearly not nominal)  CRA may consider this an "alternate form of compensation" and expect that it is claimed and taxes paid.  This amount of points is the equivalent (depending on how you value the points) of somewhere between$30k - $40k  or thereabouts  per year.,?
8158,I'd be surprised if he makes it a year. He's in this Russian thing up to his eyeballs. It's just a matter of who has the cajoles to actually expose him.,?
8159,The individuals that were listed as being part of Caldwell's campaigns that have now moved to Ige's campaign are not players to trifle with. They are all  in many ways  interconnected and plugged into a larger set of people who really have years of experience in running local campaigns in Hawaii  successfully. The exposure of the individuals listed - Imanaka  Min  Yadao  also starts to show the mechanisms that Ige plans to use in order to campaign against Hanabusa for the Primary. Ige ain't stupid  he knows that Hanabusa will bring the full might and power of the Dan Inouye campaign machine to bear in order to win the primary from Ige. So in turn  the machine that worked a win for Caldwell - which was just about as intense - has been negotiated and now working for the Governor.   Get ready  and get informed not only about the candidate on the ballot  but the people behind the candidate really making the moves. Because it is those people  in some ways  that lead the direction of Hawaii.,?

8171,And your point is what exactly?,?
8172,It's stupid because Canada produces approx. 1.6% of the total GHG's in the world and if we were able to get it to 0% (not possible)  it would not matter a wit in reducing global warming. But  it will drive up costs and cost us in jobs and growth. It hurts us and provides no benefit and fools people like you who think it's doing something to help.,?
8173,It seems obvious to me that there is a need for careful investigations here  but it is also obvious  from the "flavour" of posts  that constitutional rights are important  such as the right of a Canadian to return to Canada without fear of arrest or surveillance without cause.  "If it sounds like a duck and looks like a duck" is not a reason to charge someone with an offence  and neither is the fact that you don't think you like someone.,?
8174,Though I more than likely will never read her book and am a bit tired of discussing Hillary and the elections I feel a bit of defense is in order.    "The one who bled top secret info from an illegal server farm that most likely resulted in direct harm to our soldiers?" <--Was she not investigated by the FBI and they found nothing that they could prosecute her for?  That is what I seem to recall. "Hows the Benghazi thing going?" <--Benghazi?  Yikes  that was investigated numerous times and even House Republicans could not find anything on it. "What about the backdoor deals with Comey?" <--Not sure what you are referring to exactly.  Comey is the one who helped stifle her win with his sudden public announcement that he would be looking at Abadin/Weiner e-mails. "My opinion  neither candidate was right for the country but I'm certain Hillary was not I respect our troops much more than that." <--As SOS it is was my understanding that she had a good relationship with the military brass.,?
8175,Ha ha ha  exactly! Can you imagine Pell who is responsible for over fifty clergy sex abused victim suicides claim his innocent have heart?

8187,Essentially Trump has embraced  enjoyed  insulted and abused the media AND the GOP  with the expectation the tactic would generate all the free publicity he needed to get elected.  It worked til it didn't.  There is an old adage - Don't offend those that buy their ink by the barrel.  It dates from the newspaper print days but readily translates today.,?

In the past I've had death threats   people claim they know where I live and will call where I work and demand I'll be fired---over my opinions posted on here .

8202,Thug Gardens would be a better name these days. Ironically it is Elitche's extremely affordable season passes that make it a magnet for teenage thieves - and their victims. I find it hard to believe the park does not have video cameras which would catch most thefts. I also find it hard to believe the park does not have security who would be able to apprehend the thieves. But I guess they figure losing your backpack is the punishment for not paying their $2 locker fee.,?

8209,If Canada trades with countries with ridiculously low labour costs and standards  downward pressure will be applied to living standard of segments of the Canadian private sector. The public sector worker benefits from the lower costs of increased supply and increased competition. The gap between the private and public sector compensation continues to grow. The inflated public sector costs exacerbates our inefficiency.   Immigration of low skilled workers also applies downward pressure to wages in some private sector segments but once again the public sector worker is isolated from the negative affects. I have no problem with attempting to raise the standard of living of the less fortunate through trade  in fact I believe we have no choice if we wish for Mankind to survive. The earth cannot support the Canadian lifestyle when extended to the rest of Mankind. We should all share the burden. of this downward pressure. Both Sanders and Trump campaigned on this injustice.,?

8214,I think Donald Trump is just plain stupid  but I gave Ivanka the benefit of the doubt. Then I saw the excerpts from "Women Who Work " and realized she's just as vacuous as her father.,?
8215,I want to separate out the nonsense of the Kathy Griffins and Ted Nugents of the world from stuff that really matters. Show business people are  for the most part  self-indulgent children  and the fact that technology gives them all kinds of platforms these days doesn't mean they are worth paying attention to.  But what elected officials say and do does matter. I'm not so naive as to believe there ever was a time in U.S. history when politicians were governed by either civility or honesty  but the wildcard today is the immediate impact their words can have  and rarely for good.  Trump's insomnia-driven tweets aren't harmless. One stupid comment from him at 4 a.m. can dominate the news cycle for the next 24 hours  putting Democrats into response mode and Republicans into damage control mode. And while all that's happening  the work of the country isn't getting done.  This president's lack of personal discipline exhausts Congress  the media and the nation. And that's not a good thing.,?
8216,Racist comment----telling Maxine Waters her hair looks like a James Brown wig   which it does ? He then apologized for the wig part . Have you ever heard the garbage Maxine Waters spews ?

8222,Rather than buying back and reselling affordable units I'd rather have the agency focus on financing the units - a public-private partnership.   If these units could be sold rapidly then they would provide a reliable stream of revenue to the developer instead of being a liability. It would also even out the cash flow for the development and thus provide an incentive to the developer.  Buying back and reselling these units only bails out buyers who should not have bought in the first place and also keeps increasing the price - putting it outside the range for affordable buyers.,?

Then hang that failure around the scrawny necks of those useful idiots that passed it. Only AFTER it fails  and only AFTER the Democrats admit publicly that they FAILED  and only AFTER they come to the GOP begging on their hands and knees for the majority to do something... only THEN should the GOP pick up the pieces and do what is right - GET THEFEDERAL GOVERNMENT OUT OF HEALTH CARE!!,?
8244,My recently widowed mother is in the process of taking advantage in her home town of a new residential program whereby she will build a 400 square foot "mini-home" that fronts the alley in the back of my sister's house.   The city where she lives has 4 pre-approved floor plans to choose from  all permitting fees are waived  all utility hookup fees are waived -- that's a savings of $12 000 compared to a typical new home.   The "mini-home" has a small kitchen  one bath with shower  a single bedroom  a living room  and a covered porch of about 75 square feet.  Covered parking to one side is required  but no garage is necessary. Construction costs are estimated to be only $80 a square foot because of minimal use of concrete and load bearing members since the roof is so small.   The benefit to the city is that it provides a low-cost housing alternative for someone like my mother  and it allows them to address the "blight" of alleyways by making them street-fronts for these mini-homes.,?
8245,The Charter says that every person charged with an offence has the right to be tried within a reasonable time  without offering definitions.

8247,People need to realize that Trudeau is using Canada as his ATM and travel club. He will change the rules everytime he gets caught breaking them and to ensure he stays in power has plans to change the way we vote. Under his proposal he would have gotten 62 % of the vote in the last election. He stated that we need to change the voting system because there were so mant people unhappy with the previous conservative government. .....this is a very scary man ,?

8252,Like Roberta; Jimmy  let me put it in simpler terms. Reinbold is an Independent. Unlike Governor Walker who promised to cut government spending by 16% and supported the Goldsmith Plan until he later figured out that sleeping with the Democrats came with STD's.  Her constituents  the ones who elected her also supported the 16% cut to spending and the Goldsmith Plan; but unlike Walker she does not renege on her promise.  Now this disdain for the oil and gas industry is an interesting one considering what this industry has meant for the state and Alaskans. Replacing fossil fuel income with taxes isn't tit for tat; there aren't enough working Alaskans earning enough income to replace oil income; and restructuring the PF doesn't get us there either. I said  and let me be clear on this  Alaska's education system owes most of its livelihood to the oil and gas industry. Yes  our teachers work for the oil companies too!,?

8254,I keep saying when is this state going to stop over spending on things we don't need! This isn't Californa.

I wrote about it with no answer! Now it's grown to everyday there is atleast one dead if not more! When will they wake up  and say this has to stop? How many people have to die?maybe we have to wait till one of their kids gets killed because they were just in the way? That bullet doesn't care who's in the way.

You went to market where lots of tradesmen and venders of different wares were well represented as well as the local butcher  farmer and fishmonger.    I wonder if Elise had ever considered this thought....  The founders took special care to see that 'the people' were able to own the exact same weapon that the government troops were then using. I was their thought that this way 'the people' ought to have a fair chance against the government if it came to that.   A lot has changed since then wouldn't you agree? And yet the Government is more of a threat to our freedoms now than they have ever been at any time in out history.,?

In any event  if that is your real concern  you  should be advocating to end the use of DB plans.  The fact is that BD plans come with an un-measurable liability to future earnings for any plan sponsoring company.   Early retirement ages and longer life expectancies have changed the landscape for pensions. It has challenged both the employers and the employees.,?

8271,Put yourself in the shoes of the many public sector workers in Ontario.  With their spouses and voting-age children  they represent a large portion of the electorate (partly because most federal public servants are in Ontario).

8287,Stupid Politics is stupid no matter what side is doing it. Red or green  in the end  all that bringing up irrelevant political discussion does is further polarizes society  which makes more people think _this_ is the right idea.   It's not. Hodgkinson has done more damage to his cause than any politician has ever done to it. He's a fool. His choice to break out a firearm and attack the Representative is _exactly_ what we criticize Team Red for doing  and now  we here on Team Blue have lost a valuable counter-argument. Thanks  James! Bang up job you did. Now we have to fight to regain the upper ground  which we had until...this morning and your first shot.   Rwl  I get what you're saying  but harping on tax reform on an article about an attempted assassination? Like you said. Wrong action.,?
8288,Seems since beginning  there have been "issues " with Trudeau and taking money. Were there not some problems  before the election about Trudeau accepting pay for speaking engagements. So why is everyone in any way shocked with the tap dance Trudeau and the Liberals keep doing about these activities that keep cropping up with Trudeau/Liberals?   By the way  wasn't there an issue for Clinton re accepting ' donations' from foreign investors etc. for the "Clinton Foundation" also.. Hummmm..,?

8293,Nice theory  but the reality is different. The number of new rental buildings in Toronto is minimal despite the lack of rent controls.

8294,Maybe you should read some facts.  "For the Sudanese family who stumbled across the border Friday morning  it was an awkward march as they lugged their six suitcases  two purses  two backpacks and three plastic  J.C. Penney bags into Canada. When the father gave himself up  he was handcuffed and placed in the back of the police truck. The others — two younger boys and two adult women — were left struggling with the baggage.  Airline luggage tags indicated that they had flown out of Doha  Qatar on Monday of this week and arrived in Washington the following day  Feb. 7.  Somewhere along the route  it appeared that they had picked up brand new winter coats  boots  gloves and hats better suited to the place they hope will be their new home."  https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2017/02/10/is-trumps-refugee-crackdown-threat-pushing-asylum-seekers-into-canada.html,?

8297,After Obama Care became law  I watched my premiums go from &250 a month to $1000.  My deductible went from $1500 a year to current rate of $8000.  My 6 free office visits are now charged $40.  My blood pressure medication is now $300 every 90 days.  It was $65.  Where were your complaints against government oversight when the past administration forced their version of health care down our throat?  From what I understand  the main reason my health care costs have skyrocketed is that myself and others are paying for the people who are "less fortunate."  Considering I pay a current tax rate of 23%  I feel I'm contributing towards the less fortunate.  I now receive only 58% of my hard earned income after taxes and Obama Care.  We once fought a revolution for much  much less.  So these concerns of yours aren't concerns for more affordable health care.  They are politically motivated opinions that don't include ALL citizens.  Only those of the political party that lost the White House.,?

8299,If there is one thing that Trump WAS right about - it's that NATO has long outlived its purpose.  With the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact consigned to the dustbin of history  the military industrial capitalist triad has to find the next boogeyman to justify its ongoing bloodsucking of gullible taxpayers. It's outrageous that Canada has taken on this NATO mission.  I for one would like Canada to have friendly relations with Russia and if they have a squabble with Latvia we should be mediating not taking sides.,?

8323,You obviously know absolutely nothing at all about the DOJ process for managing pardons.  Why do you write things like this?  The issue is not whether Trump had the authority to pardon Arpaio.  It's why he would do such a ridiculous thing in the manner he did it.  He totally sidestepped the DOJ process.    Trump is a psychotic.,?
8324,I'm tired of this old bastard!! He lost an election by saying "I can work across the aisle" and telling people  every time he got the chance  that Barcock OBlowme was a good man while Barcock was calling him names. He kissed OBlowmes a** copiously!! What he really meant was that he could work to give the filthy Dumpacraps the keys to the Kingdom. Eight years under that GD Simian we had didn't teach this old Geezer anything. He still is a Traitor to the US and I  as a Vietnam Veteran  am totally ashamed of this old ghord headed Monkey  fraud!!  I can't wait for him to go to the Happy Hunting Ground!!,?

8327,Many of the homeless and the transients on the mall fit into your "bully and harass" classification. They frequently are "jerks" to people who are using the mall for their business or enjoyment. Does this bother you at all?,?
8328,This article is either crappalo or Thornton Police are total idiots and pansies. The guy walked into the store shot folks  walked out. Folks with CC permits took shelter and pulled their sidearm. Period. This is why I will never pay for the DP  leftist fake news.,?
8329,You should not use your retirement funds for non-retirement needs unless it is an emergency and you have no other way to get the money you need. You should not purchase expensive items  pay for your children's college or other costs unless your retirement nest egg is fully funded and secure. The closer you are to retirement the less likely that you will be able to replenish your retirement funds and the compounding lost from withdrawals. I read several related pages and posts on retirement planning and investing on the site Retirement And Good Living. The site provides information on many retirement topics and has several retirement and health calculators.,?

8337,The data also shows that people lie about their drinking. Alcohol has been shown to more addictive than heroin. People who drink every day or more than 10 drinks a week are addicted.  It is like any other drug: the enjoyment comes from the addiction.   Nobody  smokes a cigarette or drinks alcohol because it tastes great. The 'taste' comes from the addiction  the socialization   it is 100% psychological.  Beer  wine etc. do not taste good  it is like saying i like to take a glass of vinegar everyday because of the rich taste.,?
8338,Something is seriously wrong with this commission  it seems to have gone right off the rails. The buck always stops at the top  perhaps the chief commissioner should step down or be fired..It doesn't help that she considers the glacial pace do far to be "lightening speed".,?

8343,Western Wood said it better than I. But this is my opinion:   Sex education is biology which is a true science; gender is sociology  which is not.  Confusion is because "educators" forget their role is to teach facts  not impose values.,?

8345,A single payer  single source  universal healthcare system that puts drugs out for competitive bidding  allows NO private insurance  administrators  or vendors  and makes doctors salaried employees of the program. The 23% of GDP we spend ends up in the pockets of sleazy executives or corporations  with less than one-third of that money going to actual patient care. We can save money and provide better care  by giving up on preventing or looking for fraud  and simply make it impossible. The interstate highway system is a federal program because letting states manage is leads to chaos and corruption. The same applies to healthcare.,?

8348,So "f*** you all"  "kiss my a--" and calling out a population on the basis of their 'race' is now considered part of civil dialogue and acceptable debate.   It is offensive when coming from right wing 'supremacists'  it is offensive coming from a left-oriented 'progressive'.   Essentially  Dal officials have stripped away the moral platform to pursue such degrading thought and language from either side. Hardly progressive and certainly no victory.,?

8350,The assassination is unfortunate particularly a Russian ambassador getting killed in Ankara carries a lot of diplomatic repercussions. Will it drive wedge between Russia and Turkey or  knowing well the forces behind this killing  will it strengthen their resolve to fight together the forces that are creating instability in the region. In all probability  it will strengthen the alliance.

8355,A three year old child dying  (re "www.mlive.com/news/detroit/index.ssf/2017/01/report_3-year-old_girl_dies_in.html") is funny to you?  I have a different sense of humor.,?

8362,Is "white trash" an acceptable term to you?  I just want to know the character of the person who wants us to read and consider his comments.  What other race based epithets do you find acceptable?  Why is this hypocrisy so rampant in the left?,?
8363,First  I suggest that "ancestry=special rights" has a host of problems  not least of which is that it creates (at least) two groups of citizens possessed of different constitutional rights. We see the unfairness of this with aristocracies  but  motivated by a desire to ameliorate social problems  we seem blind to the long term problems this "two citizen classes" approach creates: i.e. we create a competition between the two classes for scarce public resources.This is not conducive to long-term civic harmony.  Second  if the relationship between indigenous identity and access to special programs unavailable to the general public is continued  then we all need to agree on who meets the def'n for this identity. No definition will be fair  as every def'n creates people who  fall just within the definition and those who always fall just outside. Neither ancestry  registration or community recognition solve this dilemma. For example  just how much ancestry is "enough" aboriginal ancestry?,?

All the photo shoots will never do anything but more than the rich and powerful sticking to the stupid middle class. You notice none of their finances are at risk. Hey  morons  in your churches don't they tell you to care for the elderly  poor and widowed. Not druggies  drunks  jailbirds  and immoral politicians and lawmakers. No? They teach screw your neighbor and thumb your nose as long as they get theirs.,?
8368,Still peddling your idiotic comment  so-called Spend Less.  How do we know you're not on Public Assistance and just trying to make yourself sound good?

8375,If you leave your car running and unlocked then you give permission to the thief to take it and your insurance company may not pay.

8376,Men acting badly and honestly  catcalling really sounds stupid. So yeah  off you go  cause your old enough to know better. Go back where you came from and try to learn something.,?
8377,Ignorance must be bliss.  Spank?  You mean create yet another distraction to cover his fat butt?  A distraction that could cost hundreds of thousands of lives.  Trump repeatedly insulted our military stating it was "weak."  Suddenly we have the greatest military in the world and we can go it alone.  You just don't get it.  SPANK.  Wow.,?
8378,You are SO deluded CEI. There are many productive marijuana smokers in the workforce. They won't admit it because of ignorant attitudes like yours. They are superior to YOU  so you MUST find a way to get ahead  right ?? Real progressive  brah !!!,?
8379,A RoB (now disappeared) article yesterday said Snap "could have got a higher price per share but wanted to sell at a lower price to MFs to avgoid churn" Can anyone comment on this ? Is this a "bought deal" before the IPO ? Are they obliged to hold the shares for a minimum period ? Seems a bit dodgy.,?

8382,What about our own monuments and memorials to political leaders of the past? Lester Pearson and Pierre Trudeau were Prime Ministers during the operation of Residential Schools and the Sixties Scoop where aboriginal children were forcibly taken from their parents.

According to the person who was acting as their guide and translator  none had any intention of residing there. More future empty houses in other words. It would seem what  has happened in the Lower Mainland is now occurring on the Island. This is not xenophobia but simple fact.,?
8392,We the People should not have to pay for Trump's political games. He should be billed for the entire  cost.,?

He demeans women and minorities. His preferred forms of communication are insults  obscenities and untruths. While Christians have been guilty of all of these  we  unlike Trump  acknowledge our sins  ask for forgiveness and seek restitution with the aid of the Holy Spirit and our community of believers.  And our Republican delegation in DC don't seem to give a damn about this.,?

8404,You have never been anywhere near the mideast   I can tell   you get all your information from false news.   It would be as if someone from the other side of the planet who had never been to Hawaii had said this   "Hawaii is not exactly what people think it is when you're not on vacation.   Very racist.   Low education low achievement population.   No vibrancy everything is stifled by unions and bureaucracy and ingrained cultural ignorance.   Not exactly Silicon Valley or NYC."

8410,The ones who built the swamp are rich  white people who largely tend to vote Republican. And using terms like LibTard or Lefty  only goes to demonstrate your level of maturity  or rather immaturity. Are you too dumb to realize that people like Trump couldn't care less about the little guy and is only interested in increasing his own wealth at any cost. Trump will not last one term  guaranteed.,?

8415,serving in the Senate to me is a privilege vs a right and politicians historically have  been held up to a higher standard of ethical behaviour in view of the importance of representing a large body of the general population (of course this concept seems to have disappeared based on scandals of the past few years). As an average Canadian to see the circumstances as outlined it completely baffles me as to how he can still be considered capable to act as a Senator.  The fact this young lady happened to turn 18 by no means implies she was a willing participant as opposed to being manipulated.,?
8416,Munoz is too late. The letters were used by the judge during sentencing. You can't redo sentencing to help appease a legislator running for reelection. Munoz's double error should not be forgotten due to retraction or stupidity.,?
8417,That cop was an idiot and deserved to be fired.  That being said there are also incidents of black cops mistreating other blacks.  Is that racist as well?  Enough of this phony white guilt and "Yes America  we are full of racists!"  Not every incident that occurs involving a black person is racist.  How in the world has this election been determined to be racist when all candidates happen to be white?  Just more programming from the left.   You need to get out in the real world and see what truly is happening- total  discord  chaos and anarchy courtesy of groups like BLM and George Soros.  What are we going to do about that?,?
8418,Not to at least find out what there might be would have been utter stupidity.,?

8426,Leave it to Altman to ignore the fact his top player just kicked a guy in the groin  and to say "he had some good moments"....How pathetic is that.,?
8427,Fools.,?
8428,how stupid to slap the hand that feeds you. this PR mayor needs a good slap down and she got it. Obama would not have done any better and this mayor would be praising him. the logistics of getting help there is staggering no communication clogged roads. the PR need to step up and get the roads cleared so aid can get to them. PR ain't south Florida.,?
8429,Good ridance. Bill can take his "no spin zone" act and go work for the Drump administration. He can't do any worse than Sean Spicer and Conway. In fact  he will fit in just nicely.,?

8432,Dylan roof was a mentally ill little scum bag and McVey was likely a cointelpro patsy...it's remarkable that the left's love affair with Islam considering the things Islam stands for are in such stark contrast to liberal western thinking.

8438,Unfortunately for your text  part of Pope Francis' job description is confirming the brethren.  So  if you're saying he either refuses to do his job  or just doesn't want to do it  thus he feels "Pope Francis owes absolutely no explanation to anybody"  the problem is larger than it appeared before you wrote.  To pretend that "we the laity" or the bishops or the priests "comprehend what AL says" given the conflicting views expressed in each of those groups is indefensible and flies in the face of reality.,?

8449,Interesting timing though.   It seems to dovetail with other machinations in the housing market.   The sociopaths and psychopaths are having lots of fun being the major *&&holes they are.   So overinvested in everything that harms others  these fools are.,?
8450,He must be held responsible for his action. As should the wmc who are whole heartedly backing this hypocrite.,?

8453,Bush was bad enough  but not as bad as Carter and esp. Obama.  Obama's goal appeared to be the total destruction of this country.  Carter was just a bumbling fool like Bush  Jr.  but Obama's hate for this country and its customs was too obvious to be ignored.,?
8454,Let's say that Canada's little contribution makes no difference either way  we still need to do something fairly soon to start to mitigate the consequences of others non actions. and that is to regulate all new construction below 100 meters above sea level.  We should do this even if we are especially good at restricting greenhouse gases and the forecasted warming fails to show up or is taking longer to arrive.,?
8455,Re: "Who will do all the dirty and menial work at Mar a Lago?"  The same 'temporary foreign workers' that he currently seeks exemptions to import  as usual  of course.   Re: "Will Trump pay the high wages and benefits??"  He doesn't NOW  so why would he in the future?,?
8456,Hey sailordope  you're as dumb as the rest of your MAGAphant buddies.  Time for you to get your head out of your Fox News A and look at the film of who took the statue down.  While the Iraqis were pounding on the statue with sledge hammers a US military vehicle pulls up attaches a rope and pulley system and pulls the statue down.  Amazing how easy it is to point out how stupid Trump voters are.  They just have to keep posting they MAGAphant  lapdog  insanity  and the show the world just how willfully ignorant they really are.  Go ahead do some real research on your stupid post about the statue.  DUH.  So glad you finally came out of the MAGAphant closet.  No point in just "liking" the MAGAphant comments  you need to post your own stupid stuff for us to be truly entertained.  Thanks for the giving me one more person to add to my moron list.,?
8457,Trudeau continually adds new dimensions to the word vapid.,?
8458,Actually Stephen.....they Don't.  No company can arbitrarily increase premiums whenever they want  in spite of your continued hysteria. To increase any premium it has to be approved by your state insurance commissioner office. Heck I have seen numbers of times when the state told companies they needed a higher increase than what they requested  to make sure the company did not go insolvent.  You would do well to educate yourself on subjects you obviously know so little about.....or keep talking and prove what many people already assume about you!,?
8459,Thanks for a stunning example of incoherent writing. Your reasoning skills are amazing.,?

8461,The clear benefits of  death with dignity in appropriate circumstances must not be allowed at the cost of facilitating unethical euthanasia. Put stronger safeguards into the bill before passing it.   It is crucial that those who don’t want to participate in the process are allowed to refuse without retaliation.  In order to deter and detect misuse of euthanasia  there must also be a mechanism for concerned observers to make complaints if procedures are violated  if other unethical conduct occurs  or if barriers to effective care are in place.  I don’t think that the bill has any of these safeguards yet. Instead   Baker's amendment to obscure the accuracy of death certificates would reduce the ability to identify improper use of euthanasia.  Those who dismiss stronger safeguards are either naive or self-centered.,?

8464,For starters  we must disentangle sacramental and moral theology  at  least in the way that they are presently intertwined  where 1) the former is treated in a reward-punishment paradigm and 2) concerns for objective scandal wrongly trump the believer's strongly presumed right to receive. In other words  change the discipline to all may  none must  some should  some shouldn't. Keep Canon 916. Ditch 915.,?
8465,The Port Moody example of an affordable townhouse option will not fly in the City of Vancouver either. New build townhouses in Richmond are selling for a million dollars  anything on the north side of the Fraser  commands much  more.  increasingly  the average working family cannot afford a townhouse option.  And once any sort of viable and frequent public transit service gets extended to the east  affordability options in those areas will diminish too.  Unless we get a handle on  the commodification of our housing stock  and it's attraction for overseas money  densification will solve little.  Other than  as you mention  the rabbit hutch being the only option...but increasingly that rabbit hutch will be the only option all over metro Vancouver  and eventually the Fraser Valley.,?

Not to mention a robust sport and commercial  fishing industry.  Kelly's take on this is right on.  Walker's " Unity" party is a failed experiment that has been a disaster for the state.

8487,"It's 2017!"  Lame.  Alexander Hamilton (January 11  1755 or 1757 – July 12  1804) was an American statesman and one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. He was an influential interpreter and promoter of the U.S. Constitution  as well as the founder of the nation's financial system  the Federalist Party  the United States Coast Guard  and The New York Post newspaper. As the first Secretary of the Treasury  Hamilton was the main author of the economic policies of the George Washington administration. He took the lead in the funding of the states' debts by the Federal government  as well as the establishment of a national bank  a system of tariffs  and friendly trade relations with Britain.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton,?

8503,The trend of appointing cast-offs from the Ontario Liberal government to influential federal positions started with Butts (the real PM)  and continues unabated.  Would not be surprised if Wynne joins the federal government next spring after an embarrassing loss in the Ontario election.  The same grossly negligent characters and their destructive policies  which led Ontario to becoming one of the most indebted sub-sovereigns on the planet  will now be pulling Trudeau's puppet strings for the entire country.

8508,Trump doesn't have the gonads to face anyone one on one that may disagree with him  he's way too thin skinned. Proof is in the way he tried to ignore Jim Acosta of CNN the other day  the more Acosta pushed his question the more pissed and red faced this thin skinned buffoon became. He couldn't answer the question honestly without making himself look like the idiot that he truly is. That's why he uses Twitter  because it's a one-sided conversation and no one can question him or disagree with him. Kindergarten mentality.,?

8524,1% to 3%.  But  the profit margin is irrelevant in the context of the conversation.   Difference is they actually provide PRODUCT  not simply a place where you give them $100  then go to some other warehouse to get $96 of food.

Zuma will have even more control after the vote.  Next step is Elections. They will know by now that the population is wavering to the "right"  and will plan accordingly. As the noose tightens the play will get dirtier. There are no guarantees that the election will be fair. We are in for a rough ride....

8552,http://tinyurl.com/h99en34  Oh heck. It looks like all that Trump isolationism isn't really working out. Suppose he lied?  It turns out that people probably should have noticed that when a man says he loves torture and wants to "bomb the shit out of 'em" he's probably not a peacenik who wants to withdraw from the world.  Anyone who didn't understand instinctively  in their bones  that Trump was a violent warmonger needs to take a good hard look at their assumptions.,?

8566,Wow.  That's quite the condemnation of Trump then.,?
8567,First   and foremost  it would make absolutely "0" difference in the outcome of the death. Toxicology tests show a variety of results   but the only ones ever listed are what they find that can be said is illegal. Prescription medicines are rarely listed   and over the counter medicines like benedryl make you sleepy. The reason it is listed on a toxicology report is so the user can be charged with being the cause of the accident  even if it was blatantly the other persons fault. Statutory laws related to a " controlled substance"are designed to generate money for Law Enforcement   and are more often abused than any other. No one has even done an objective study that would determine if Cannabis actually impairs a persons ability to drive. Current Federal Law forbids such a study. So when a person makes claims that of deaths due to Cannabis they are either very misinformed   or lying through their teeth. Through all of the years that Cannabis has been criminalized  it's still growing.,?

The deference granted for the last 60-plus years to Presidents and their Attorneys General and their Secretaries of State under 8 USC Section 1182  especially with a conservative majority on it  leads me to believe that the 9th Circuit gets overruled once again (assuming this doesn't moot out).,?

8579,Trump speaks far better than our PM Trudeau and that was a good speech he gave last night.,?
8580,It sounds like you're in a difficult situation. But there's one point you make that cannot be correct: "I did not get ... health care." I don't know what province you reside in  but you're entitled to the same health care as everyone else -- i.e. what is provided by your provincial health plan. Don't tell lies that make your situation seem more difficult than it actually is.,?
8581,I meant the waitress moron,?
8582,Well thought through  Jimbob7  especially your summary sentence. It is a challenging environment in which to lead.  The degree of hopelessness felt likely correlates highly with the urge to seek mere compliance as a way to paper over the reality of failed leadership.  Seeking to identify the Holy Spirit's leading and supporting it wherever it is found seems so much more promising (and biblical: Acts 15) than pursuing compliance while marching in place as division after division succumbs to the social irrelevance demanded by the now substantial majority of Seventh-day Adventism defined by colonial ecclesiology.  Where do you see hope trending?,?

8586,Actually the MOA has some weird things  hence why it's the "municipality of" rather than the "city and borough of". The problem remains though that the Metro area doesn't cover Girdwood and APD can't  by law  force Girdwood to accept APD officers and costs. APDs hands are tied.,?
8587,One of the things I find most disturbing about trump followers is their (and your) refusal to recognize how much he lies.  Or do you not care?  Maybe you've become inured to his lying?  Even more apalling is the hypocritical support offered him by conservative evangelicals.  That is truly sad!,?
8588,If you get any farther out in right field  you won't even be in the game.  The issue is the Republican traitors dismantling the remaining science and environmental efforts to understand life on this planet and quit polluting it.  All else in your stupid response is nothing except wild ranting without intelligence or logic.  Get thee back to school!,?
8589,I called you ignorant because you called me a bottom feeder City worker  when I don't work for the City and you don't even know me.  But how disgusting that is what #TeamDjou thinks of the 10K people that work hard for the every day for the City.,?
8590,Harper was an idiot. Trudeau is an idiot. I can't wait for the next one.,?
8591,Exactly right  JM-B.   36 grand per year on gifts  dining out   drinks and entertainment/ hobbies   and that does not include travel..   Easily chopped.  I don't mind  healthy travel expenditures  but I don't waste a lot of money eating  boozing and dining out in my home turf.  As for 7000 per month after taxes in retirement..that seems very much a stretch goal for these folks.,?
8592,for all involved here. It takes one to know one. :),?
8593,I love the pure ignorance of the Trump supporters. First denial  when that doesn't work then deflection  and when that doesn't work then flat out who cares.   The ignorance of these people is only matched by the Trump family itself. They must think the whole world is stupid. The fact is the world is now practically in unison in condemning the orange idiot family. It must be getting pretty tense around that family these days as they have nowhere to turn to. The best part of this is in the long run the Trump business will be ruined too because nobody will want involvement with it at any level.,?

8595,Do they have a roof over their heads and are they safe? Yes? Then perhaps the government and the media could spare some attention for homeless  Canadians. In Vancouver it is below 0 and snowing  has been for days and will continue to be below 0 for the foreseeable future. Yet we have no stories on the 200-300 homeless in Vancouver. Sure they are almost entirely men so they don't count for much in our modern caring society  that much is clear  but still perhaps a little ink and a little attention could be given to them.,?

8597,"walking north-bound on Kapiolani Boulevard west of Kamakee Street"  While Kapi'olani can reasonably be divided into sections that are "east" and "west" of Kamakee  it's really not accurate to describe the section just "west" of Kamakee as north- and southbound.    Please keep the directions local-style  because outside Hawai'i nobody cares about the details of this accident  and on O'ahu we've historically not used these terms and can't relate to them.    It'd be more useful to keep using our traditional O'ahu directional terms and say that she was walking mauka on Kapi'olani ewa of Kamakee.  These are examples of the directional terms that we use among ourselves in everyday language here.  Malihini need to learn them in order to navigate  and our local media need to continue using them to facilitate that process and maintain one of the differences that make our Island culture special.  And to repeat  "Ewa" and "mauka" are just simply more accurate descriptions in this instance.,?

8605,Problem with the democrats is that they have gotten away from being number one.  Hawaii was one of the first to legalize abortion and the equal rights amendment.  But we fell to 14 to legalize same sex marriage and we still have not legalized a plant that was created by God on the third day of creation.  Come on Democrats show some guts.  Legalize Marijuana!   Call for a reduction in the military industrial complex.  Lets look to other sollutions than locking people up.  Housing is a problem.  So where are your ides?    I woud like to be able to talk about republicans but they have no ideas and haven't since Eisenhower.  They are basically brain dead.,?
8606,This is a really critical issue and deserves a prominent debate.  We don't want to end up in a situation similar to the US where there are right wing vs. left wing media - just the news please!  If the CBC is to survive it must be seen to be politically neutral.    Are there media in other countries that could be used as models?  BBC perhaps?,?

8608,He's a sociopath:  There are several signs that someone may be a sociopath  including showing a lack of remorse  having a disregard for the law  and frequently telling lies.,?
8609,And you're a moron. It's a political attack. It didn't happen. What are you  complicit  thick  or just wishful thinking? Not everyone fondles children like your "daddy.",?
8610,I guess they're outlining the economic malaise our country is experiencing and dismal outlook we have with the present government. Things just don't look good with the majority of our economic growth being built on a housing bubble.  That's our reality as this government is doing nothing to get us out of our economic funk.  At least the IMF didn't pump out another idiotic false report about Canada subsidizing oil and gas by $34 billion annually....... it was criminal how they cooked up that piece of garbage that the left lapped up and kept pounding these boards with.  Being Trudope hasn't changed anything policy-wise I'm wondering why there are no longer claims from the left that Canada is still subsidizing this ridiculous number?  All facts still point to there being only $55 million in subsidies to oil & gas for environmental research and innovation from the last government which is a drop in the bucket from the lies the IMF was claiming in their report.,?
8611,Interview their third grade teachers and they'll all say "I knew this is where he was headed. He was doomed to commit some really stupid crime that didn't make sense.",?
8612,aa the usual ignorant hate filled stupidity by  a lefty as usual  no moron  we can ship plenty more to grow our economy and create thousands of great jobs!!   the demand is there.. and rail is NOT safer that pipe  god your stupidity is out of site,?
8613,Thanks for the heads up  Natalie. Yet what can we do about the City Council approving the latest plan?  I clicked on your link and pulled up the Recovery Plan - over 200 pages!  Every  City Rail Plan and their EIS are so thick and detailed it's a full time job trying to understand them!  Frustrating for citizens who feel compelled to constantly watchdog the City because they have lost our trust.,?
8614,Amazing that Duke can see the obvious in this case  but refuses to see it in so many others.,?
8615,Washington judge is a terrorist.,?
8616,I read through every one of these comments here sir and I do not see any reference to 'Hillary is preferred to Trump'.  Not yet anyway and maybe that will change but please  for the sake of honest commentary  don't emulate your fear-mongering hero and his proclivity for ignoring truth and facts by equating a distaste for Donald Trump with a preference for Hillary Clinton.,?
8617,Why is this a surprise?  About two-thirds of all people are stupid and/or ignorant.,?
8618,Mark Mew was a coward crappy Chief  had zero respect from the department because he was such a poor leader  good riddance to him and his coward sidekick deputy chief Gilliam.,?
8619,I know this is heresy but some of the blame lies with John Elway. Drafting a QB in the first round who can't beat out a seventh round draft pick or Osweiler is sad.,?
8620,Couldn't agree with you more!  Trump will win re-election easily with these buffoons in the Media helping the inept far left DemoRATS ,?
8621,I saw an article recently where China has built a gigantic solar panel power plant right on top of an old coal mine. I understand that American coal companies are doing that as well.  So  yes  we understand we have a problem  and we are trying to fix it  in spite of our idiot leaders. Go humans!,?
8622,Calling this car's appearance "polarizing" is being unnecessarily kind and somewhat disingenuous. Overwhelmingly  everyone I know thinks it's hideous  along with the i8. Others of recent BMW concept cars use similar "design language" and they are also "polarizing" in appearance. I wouldn't be caught dead in one of these i cars and I wouldn't own either at any price. I suppose eco-zealots tend to be extroverted when it comes to their vehicle choices  but most normal people want a vehicle that looks normal. Why BMW didn't simply make a smaller vehicle like a 1 series with the i3 powertrain is really a mystery. Oops.,?
8623,Jim Hanlen  if you have a choice  ask for Sharia.  They take pity on idiots.,?
8624,Personally  I don't look to the U.S. (or Canada) as a model for how to run public amenities.  I have a lot of respect for the private sector  but we don't inspect them for waste to the extent we do government. Whenever human beings do something  there is waste. It's a fact of life. Should we abandon public education or the Police or highway construction because there is waste? Let's reduce waste  let's fight for efficient and good services  but let's not use waste as an excuse to not raise the tax money required by good public services.,?
8625,So  John.  Hindsight is 20/20.  However  80% of Americans supported the invasion of Iraq at the time.  I was one of the 20% that wasn't.  Which group were you in back then?,?
8626,Tell me oldruss  were you originally offended when the president of the United States called anyone that knelt a "son of a bitch" and suggested that they should be fired? Because that's a whole lot more offensive  especially coming from someone in his position  than a group of men taking a knee during the anthem  which their employers approve.,?
8627,Nothing is wrong with it.  Except that Trump is lying by saying that it will not help rich people.  It will  and a lot.  Trump is a compulsive and pathological liar who needs to be removed from office as soon as possible.,?
8628,Not erased  simply more appropriately honored  say by a portrait with a plaque beneath narrating his contributions  in the hallway of the police department building. I've no interest in not recognizing Chief Lee's service to Kent  it's just that in the greater scheme of things  it pales in comparison to the harm created by publicly displaying the name of Robert E. Lee on a city building in the center of town and attached to the police department. Sorry if I have bruised your tender sensibilities once again. I'm happy to think that perhaps this exchange has served to inform more people of who the building is actually named after  but alas  those very few who read this are inconsequential to the thousands of folks that pass by the building everyday and naturally concluding that the building is named after the nationally renown General  not the locally known Chief  thus creating the visual of Kent being supportive of all the terrible things the Confederacy stood for.,?

8635,Today  in a possibly inadvertent admission of Russian collusion  Trump tweeted  "There was electronic surveillance of Trump  and people close to Trump. This is unprecedented."  For Trump's tweet to be true  there are 2 possibilities: 1) a FISA court judge granted an order permitting the surveillance of Trump  or 2) Trump was caught talking with Russian agents who were the target of surveillance.  It's amazing that Trump doesn't understand that either way it doesn't look good for him.,?
8636,If Trump keeps reading the teleprompter he'll be boring with nothing to say  rather than entertaining with nothing to say  and he'll lose even bigger. Not enough lipstick for that pig.,?
8637,Suck it up buttercup!,?
8638,Bought a couple of  T-shirts in Athens this year with "Molon Labe" on them!  They seem to be popular with American tourists!  With 330 million firearms in private hands (More than one each for the entire US population) I think seizure is unlikely this week or next.  When it would have to be done by police officers  many of whom have their own personal firearms  as do their friends   it becomes even more unlikely.,?
8639,we live in a bizarre world when people think there is more money to spend because the deficit was not as large as they thought.  This is absolutely crazy  and the craziest part of all is the citizens are too stupid to see the reality.,?

8646,The realestate agents pulling in that kind of money are virtually non-existent!  By and large they live from pay cheque to pay cheque ... that are few and far between.  They like most other small businesses need the tax breaks just to survive let alone plan for a future.,?
8647,Or perhaps because irresponsibility is now regarded as a virtue?,?
8648,No one's stopping Thug from saying any dumb thing that happens to come out of his mouth. Doesn't mean anyone has to report on it.,?
8649,I agree that Trudeau is spectacular. but I will leave it to you to guess what he is spectacular at.,?
8650,The lack of censorship at this paper makes it a shining example and beacon above all other sources in addressing this topic.  Freedom of speech and expression provided one doesn’t hurt anyone else’s feelings is not really freedom of speech and expression.  “I disapprove of what you say  but I will defend to the death your right to say it"  Where have you gone Evelyn Beatrice Hall  a nation turns its lonely eyes to you ?  Woo hoo hoo,?
8651,Your other post obviously was flagged. But I will accept and base my judgments on the first hand accounts of qualified journalists and biographers over an anonymous guy named "yardman" on the RG site.,?
8652,Yes  cause the F rating shows when we needed her she was not there. It is that plain & simple.,?
8653,Wisdom Cliffy wow!,?
8654,You repubs control all of government.  If you cannot repeal ObamaCare it is the repubs who are weak and feckless.  Quit blaming the Democrats - repubs are in control and we see what a disaster they have made of governing.  repubs cannot handle being in charge - the first thing they do is start praising Nazis and working with Russkies to undermine our government and Constitution.  repubs are pathetic and unpatriotic.  We love ObamaCare!!!,?
8655,Wikileaks said it wasn't the Russians who leaked evidence.  It is well known that hardworking people in the CIA and FBI were horrified when Lyin Hillary wasn't charged with treason and all the other things she could have been charged with.  Let alone the billions they took in in that sham charity from countries buying favors..  Any sane person knows it was a inside leak from caring Americans who had had enough of the corruption and did the right thing by leaking this crap.  Look at the emails - they show corruptions right to Obama. The entire Liberal left is corrupt and we have had enough of their awful lies and deceptions.  Look at Trudeau and his fundraising scam.  Lyin Hillary - You lost because you are a scammer,?
8656,I attempted 4 times to go to the article you cite but not able to. the web site is interesting and very funny. It brought back fond memories of the humor I found in Pravda and Izvestia back in the 70's. That stuff was very humorous  it was so out of touch with reality.,?
8657,I'm sure those "escorted" openings through the tunnel sure scared the rocks.  They'd never even think about falling with the "escort" in the area.  They should have had two "escorts" to make it even safer.,?
8658,Apparently you feel the comment by Shatshow is appropriate for an article about a public figure that has a serious medical problem. Good for you. There is a time and place for everything  and pretending MY comment the culprit is a fantasy on your part. The rest of your comment about Afghanistan/Archie Bunker is simple background noise. Sorry.,?
8659,Trump Troll,?
8660,WestToEast  Thanks for taking the time to actually read what I posted.    In my case  I am lucky to enjoy the trade I currently ply my time with (I have three trades  two of them Red Seal).   Not all trades are dirty  disgusting work.  Some actually allow you to think and work with the latest technology.  As a side benefit I make excellent money that has provided for me and my wife well and we will soon be enjoying a well funded retirement.,?
8661,How silly of you.  My wife is a Pathfinder leader  being fortunate  we live in a multicultural city and her group reflects that diversity.  With the present White Supremacist  stupidity in the USA there is the very real chance that a girl in her group could be singled out or refused entry.  The Guides have taken the correct approach  and it's a good lesson for the girls that racism and bigotry are to be opposed  always.,?
8662,For the record  I despise neo-nazi and white supremicist views as well as whatever views allow a person to falsely insinuate that I agree with them in any way. All for having explained the fallacies of a poll. Tazedandconfused  I note you upvoted yourself on both of your replies. That says more than your actual comment.,?
8663,Just what we need.  The idiots driving massive SUVs like race cars are not causing enough problems??  Now we give them these things to throw around in the sky.  Yikes.,?

8671,Utterly ridiculous that the "#1 nation in the world" continues to have the most F **** D up tax system on the planet that's geared to enable and benefit the top percentile who can afford tax attorneys and accountants on retainer.  What actions of substance have our vaunted CONgressional and senate delegation to Washington done  together with their party  to reform this anachronistic and rigged system in a bipartisan way?,?
8672,Gussuk is correct..  At the time he walked  I was hairdresser to a prosecutor  and she said  "I hope the jury is satisfied with themselves.  They just let a serial killer go free.",?
8673,Regardless of whether the term "wiretap" is correct  there is more evidence of the Obama administration spying on Trump than there is of Russia hacking the election. No agency has said they are certain Russia did anything. They say they are "highly confident" because they can't provide any evidence.,?
8674,love our left wing frineds here who actually find obama's desire to control what people eat as a good reason for more fascist government!!   pathetic and  sad    see loser they now get to choose   that is freedom  ,?
8675,That would be a no. Would you like me to explain the weather events around 2 of her 3 examples  and the theory around the 3rd to bring you up to speed? Don't forget the results of our "who's more virtuous" discussion.,?
8676,Sorry  as a UAS alumnus  NO.  We need campuses in every region of the state.  Internet courses work for some classes  but not for all.  Campuses also provide libraries which are essential for hgher education (yes  some of us still read books).  Each region's campus needs to develop specialties based on their location.  Marine biology and forestry at UAS  for example.  Because of its smaller size  UAS has had a higher success graduating Alaska Native students in its education program --- students from small villages don't feel as overwhelmed as they do in Fairbanks or Anchorage.  We need those teachers for our Bush schools!  Part-time or returning students are a larger segment of UA students than at state universities in other states  and many of those students need campuses in their communities so they can work or care for their families while they finish their degrees.,?
8677,For the past 85 years  no SC Justice has been appointed during an election year.  Unfortunately  Obama was in for 8 LONG years. McConnell didn't do too well in that respect.  The Americans also weighed in again. The Dems lost. MOVE ON!,?
8678,Eaton's too...and we all know what happened to them.,?
8679,I wonder what these idiots will do today  i.e. sit  stretch or just scratch their asses during the anthem!,?
8680,Only 4 US Presidents have ever lost the popular vote before Trump did so in November 2016.  1824 - John Quincy Adams (lost by a margin of 38 221 votes)  1888 - Benjamin Harrson (lost by a margin of 94 530 votes)  1876 - Rutherford B. Hayes (lost by a margin of 252 666 votes)  2000 - George W. Bush (lost by a margin of 543 816 votes)  2016 - Donald J. Trump (lost by a margin of 2 864 974 votes)  The Donald is really by far the biggest loser in US history having lost the popular vote by a margin five times greater than Dubya which is yet another reason why Murka is an oligarchy -- not a democracy.  Not sure where all his groupies on these threads come from given no one in Canada actually supports Trump.,?

8688,By the way Idiot in Chief would be IIC not IIO  but I won't quibble with you particularly given that you seem to be implying you would at least like a credible Conservative opposition to the Trudeau cult of personality.    Here's a homework assignment for you Robert.  Calculate your estimate of the probability that Donald Trump is an idiot. We know he is the elected Chief.   You can use any time period you wish for your calculation  but to keep it simple I would just use the 18 months since he announced he was running for President through the time he was elected President to do your assessment.  Explain your estimate - you know  use numbers and explain how you got them.,?
8689,Smart enough not to vote Trudeau and so that must make your Liberal neighbours morons.,?

Wonder why trump felt he is a good candidate to defend o'reilly?  Oh  yeah  he is a narcissistic child who never learned appropriateness.,?
8694,These oil soaked clowns in the legislative majorities have drug this out for 5 months now and this is the best they can come up with. If I were Walker I'd plant their asses in Anchorage where the public can get to them for as long as it takes and for as many special sessions as it takes. They've already cost us millions and millions of dollars on garbage that we'll never see a dimes worth of return on  hold their feet to fire until they accomplish the one thing they are paid to do  that is to come up with a viable and sustainable budget FOR THE PEOPLE.,?
8695,Just eliminate football  tear down the existing stadium. Proble  solved.,?
8696,Assume for the moment that this passes. There will be a drop in taxes for Paul Ryan's favorite $59K/year family. When fully in place  they will actually see it shrink and become a tax increase as time goes on.  https://medium.com/whatever-source-derived/how-a-tax-cut-turns-into-a-tax-increase-960c32d1ba82  But wait - it gets better. You know that $1 500 000 000 deficit? As soon as that happens  then you will hear:   "Gosh - we've GOT to get this deficit under control. Everyone has to tighten their belts. We will unfortunately have to make cuts in Social Security  Medicare  and other entitlements. The military will be off limits of course!"  Every time they make some grand proposal  they give it a name  usually 180 degrees away from what it actually does. To break with that tradition  perhaps this should be called "The Great Bait and Switch act of 2017".,?

8699,ctd...  And then there's the fact that anyone who criticises anything to do with Islam  for example  the burqa  or a failure to integrate into western societies  is labelled a xenophobic  Islamophobic  racist bigot.

8700,IMO  they share some responsibility because they are acting as enablers instead of telling Caldwell to fix his own problems.  Then of course  ideally the entire project dies.,?
8701,It's disinformation in the sense that what her grandfather did is irrelevant. It's not factual because it doesn't tell the whole story.  While it's true there were many Ukrainians who happily joined the Nazis and agreed with their anti-Semitic ways  it is also true that many Ukrainians were primarily interested in resisting the Soviet Red Army and hoped to reassert Ukrainian nationhood.  After the war  the Soviet Union painted all Ukrainians who resisted the Red Army as Nazis which is not entirely accurate. It's an old trick from the Soviet playbook which Putin is very familiar with. It's also known Putin has it in for Freeland. Personally  I think it's because she understands him too well for his own liking. She wrote "Plutocrats: The Rise of the New Global Super-rich" which is implicitly critical of the plutocracy Putin is busily setting up with his cronies.  Either way  perhaps she should have come cleaner sooner  but it really is a misleading story to begin with.,?

8709,All those people who relate this to Punahou High school are retarded.  He is a trouble man and has nothing to do with his high school or college.  I dont even understand why the reporter mentioned his high school.   Statitics show that Punahou and Iolani have to more successful professionals then all the other public school put together.   They claimed 65% of all academic scholarships even though they represent only 5% of the kids.,?
8710,C'mon man anybody that gets up and tells everybody they one bad ass brother has a freaking problem. And he's a mayor? Under indictment for abuse of a county credit card?

His speech to HPU grads was awesome. Awesome. Billy you gotta put down the bottle brother.,?
8711,Rollercoaster.  Say what!,?
8712,WHY OH why are taxpayers still insuring all this crap at all??????? Maybe someday  sanity will return.   As of now I  and most of you  have idiotically free-spending  brainless city  provincial and federal governments.  (Plus the whole Sword of Damocles-type CMHC situation...) Greece is not as far away as you might think.  Argentina was once the 4th or 5th highest per capita income  then started down the road we are upon...Watch for the private pensions to start toppling over next  then they will ask for taxpayers to bail them out - and we already did - we gave $6B to the CAW pension during the auto bankruptcies - and Justin is not going to develop  common sense any time soon.,?

8715,I'm no fan of Cruz by any means.  However  putting it all in context  Trump openly called him "Lying Ted" and Trump in the most bizarre claim  stated that Cruz's father was involved in the Kennedy assassination. Ted's non-endorsement should be no surprise.,?

8717,Yeah it's like Ducksworth and Gabbard did anything stellar in Washington. These very two are using their military experience as a  crutch(no pun Intended) to get into office! I agree! People tend to look at their military career instead of their........... competency. I know POTUS Trump has the Veterans and The Military locked up" lock stock and barrel"! This will be a hard hill  for the Democrats to climb  no body trust them any more. They deceive whine  and lie through both sides of their mouths. They are just Poor Sports/Cry Babies/Sore Grapes who don't know how to lose with dignity. Hey Democrats! Listen up! Get ready for another thrashing! IMUA!,?

8725,"And none of that ever involved him."    It may well have not involved him directly  but I would wager that early in life he was warned that the persons one surrounds themselves with  or direct associates  will have a bearing on their reputation or how others perceive them to be.   As far as the "Best Governor" this state has ever had  I would call into question your standards of what "Best" is. His willingness to place his own beliefs and or wants above those of the voting public  showed a simple disregard for those that paid his wages.,?
8726,I'm a CA/CPA too.  Trudeaus statement is ludicrous. The guy is a liar.,?

8730,Neko  your question is truly ironic - for me. You are aware of the old learning for the lazy rather than "Dummies"  called "Coles Notes"?  Well my limited exposure to Lonergan was in concert with epistemology from a Jesuit by the name of "Kohls". As far as I know Fr. Harry never published but he was close to and parallel with Lonergan but more leadership in experiential process. You might google Fr. Tim Fallon  S.J.  now passed  but he was involved in a Lonergan Centre at a Calif. University where a lot has been published.,?
8731,It doesn't matter that a big part of the BC Liberal voting base also supports the federal CPC  but it does matter that the party is CALLED "Liberals"?  A vote is an endorsement of a given party's platform and  if that party is the incumbent government  an endorsement of their conduct while in office.  I don't think right  left  or centre have a monopoly on bad behavior. And I don't think anyone who ascribes governing traits based on a party's name should be making comments about "pathetic" arguments.,?
8732,You appear very ignorant of what really goes on in the world today.  I am not saying that The US is the worlds slave masters but are you aware at all of all the sex trafficking  going on in the country? This is a form of slavery.  And why do I sound like a troll?  That describes you a lot better I think sincwe you really make such weak responses.,?

8740,What has blaming others actually done to improve the situation in the black community?  Blaming white privilege and bad cops and the laundry list of other grievances isn't getting it done.  The fact is  proven by history  the only way for the black community to get out of this malaise is to own it and fix it from within.  I don't need to get "woke."  They need to stop making excuses for people who do stupid stuff.,?

8746,Private or not  the beer stores exclusivity makes them an extension of gov't.  I can't speak to Alberta but in BC competition has delivered not only some relief in price (albeit small)  but more choice in product and far more location and hours of availability to consumers.  My local private beer and wine store not only sells a bottle of decent Red wine at about $0.50 less per bottle than BC gov't stores but also offers me a 10% drop in price if i buy a case  which I can do on Sunday and even late into the evening every day of the week.   Gov't invades every facet our lives  reduces choice and increases costs. Their role in this should be to regulate and tax within reason  nothing more.,?
8747,He'e Nalu is traditional native Hawaiian activity that is kapu and reserved for specific few.  The cultural practice was coined as "surfing" and western commerce was born at the fault of natives and non natives alike.  Money has neither culture nor race resulting in gridlock waves   overrun reefs  drugs  and no access.  So  let consumerism determine.  If there is money and commerce to compensate a surfer no matter what they wear or look like  then it will be.   If not  then not.  Simple.  Profiteering  like war  is NOT a democracy.  It is survival of the best marketeers.  And  my aloha goes to all the dental floss and boardshorts athletes alike.,?

I nearly forgot about this angry little incompetent troll  except that every time we have an act of terrorism  she tends to come up because of those "survey markers" of hers prior to Giffords getting shot.   All I can say is: thanks  McCain  for inserting this moron onto the international stage.,?
8761,POTUS left remnants of a previous administration in place. Why Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein (Obama holdover) would recommend firing of Comey then hire Comey's BFF (Mueller) to conduct a 'collusion/obstruction' inquiry against the POTUS is beyond belief.   Definition of a 'bad' lawyer is one who make a case last for months/years. A 'Good' lawyer makes it last longer........,?
8762,But how do you understand the role of the magistrum?   I used an analogy  perhaps it may help you understand what I mean.  If we take a class in grammar class for example  I am not suggesting the teacher should beat the knowledge into the child  but shouldn't the teacher carefully  patiently and clearly explain the rules of how a sentence is structured?  To go further with the analogy  what I am seeing is a teacher who may confuse pupils by refusing to state whether or not "the cats bowl" or "the cat's bowl" is correct. Whether or not "I am going to the store to bought milk" or "I am going to the store to buy milk" Is correct.   Should the teacher be able to say yes or no to the above?  Couldn't your take on discernment in the end mean that grammar is irrelevant and the student should write as he pleases?   What do you mean by traditional Romanism? Hasn't the East also dogmas and doctrines?,?
8763,OK  ... and not pay your taxes  not yell fire in a crowded theater  not license your vehicle.  Your line of reasoning is that of a sociopath and pathetic to boot.  No man (or woman) is an island  get it  or would you prefer to build your own school  highways  and runways (for example)??,?

8772,"Ms. Renzetti : I loved your metaphor - silence is a cave that provides no shelter."  Precisely. It was precisely such neglectful  hypocritical greedy arrogant silence that lost Hillary Clinton the election.

8785,The "appeal to nature fallacy" is at work here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_nature  Fluoride is a chemical. Chemicals are bad. Therefore  fluoride is bad.  A lot of people die from inhaling dihydrogen monoxide  and it is much more common. It is also commonly used with toothpaste  so if we ban dihydrogen monoxide  we could also limit "poisoning" by fluoride. I think the Anchorage Assembly should consider banning dihydrogen monoxide in all its insidious forms  immediately. Lives are at stake here!,?

8792,Most of the wealth in the US is in the form of real estate values  stock prices  and bond prices  all three of which are in 'bubbles."  Many foresee a crash of up to 70% to get back to normal relationships to earnings and book values.  They are inflated by artificially low interest rates  which the Fed says it wants to normalize (because extended low interest rates distort markets).  If that happens  we won't be so rich.  The actually U6 money supply in this country is only 35% of the total debt  which is not supposed to happen under Keynesian Economics  which assumes a closed system we don't have.  Most of the money created by our debt has found a home in another country.  As for Sweden  it has become the rape capital of the world  and the government is trying to hide that fact.  Also  they have negative interest rates to try to stimulate their economy.  Why  if they're doing so well?  Both government and personal debt are soaring in Sweden. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdGPPLmR5Bc,?

8796,Hi James:    "...  PP isn't an arm of the federal government anymore than General Dynamics ..."  OK  I think that we're making some progress here.  :)  And just like a Federal contract with  say  Halliburton  there is nothing in the law that says said contracts ought to be extended infinitely into the future and never come up for renegotiation  or indeed  termination.  Right?  "... you ask the absurd question ..."   Why absurd?  In many ways  taking PP fully 'private' as a charitable foundation makes eminently good sense.  As EN noted  quite a share of PP's funding already comes from such entities as the Gates Foundation or the Pew Charitable Trusts.  Take it all the way to 100% by dunning the stable of rich liberals I mentioned (who all could easily afford to fork up a few $10s of millions each - most of them  every year!)  and look at the advantages.  Free of any remaining Federal restrictions.  Out of the crosshairs of the Culture Wars.  In the friendlier state jurisdictions ...,?

You give them too much credit when you actually think that they are interpreting the Bible. They are using the Bible as a prop  as a justification for their vicious beliefs. When you say Jeffress is "wrong"  you are understating the problem by several orders of magnitude.  Jeffress is a vicious  calculating  hard right fascist.   Jeffress is not merely wrong  he is a cancer on the United States.  Jeffress is not merely wrong  he is a cold  calculating hypocrite of the highest order  a devil and a traitor to American values.,?

8815,I hope people can put aside the Democrat  Republican  conservative and liberal labels that we box ourselves in with  and can start to see some of these bills and policies for what they actually are and what they will actually do. This bill in particular was just a smoke screen to make yet more money for the insurance companies and give yet more tax breaks to the already rich. It had nothing to do with actually improving health care in America or in making heath insurance more affordable for those who struggle to make monthly premiums. Under this bill  millions would have lost what limited coverage they have.  The Trump/Ryan Health Care bill was being "sold" simply on the premise that it was a repeal of "Obamacare"  hoping that that in itself would be enough to get the bill passed. Luckily  enough people saw through this cynical charade. Whatever the many flaws Obamacare may have  generally speaking  it is far superior to what this bill would do  Let's actually fix healthcare.,?

8836,It wouldn't be so bad if it was just ONE big lie.......but it's really his deficit spending that is a HUGE lie on so many levels. First it was modest deficits of NO MORE than $10 billion for two years and then balance the budget. His reasoning? We were in a recession AND we needed to invest in infrastructure immediately to "kickstart" the economy. Lie number one: we were NOT in a recession. Lie number two: he immediately authorized deficits of $30 billion. Lie number three: huge deficits will continue - there is no plan to EVER balance the budget. Lie number four: only about 20% of the deficit is being used for infrastructure. Lie number five: what little infrastructure money there is - has been very slow in getting out the door - as evidenced by the Auditor General's remarks. Interesting how the media goes easy on this guy.,?

8846,No.   -  Knowledge evolves and accumulates  of course.  -  Speaking of trust  you are making the assumption that marijuana consumers are not trustworthy.  -  That is a wholly baseless and bigoted assumption.  SAMHSA research determined more than 100 million Americans have consumed marijuana. That's near HALF the of-age population. There are an estimated 30 to 50 million current consumers. The vast majority consume moderately - on the weekends or less  and are successful  hard-working  respected members of their communities.  They are from all walks of life and loved by the families they support.   Since we now know marijuana is less "addictive" than coffee  is not a significant cause of auto accidents  does not fuel violence like alcohol  and is far less harmful than alcohol  this is no surprise.  Every person who switches from Budweiser to buds improves their health tremendously - as well as the lives of their family and community.,?
8847,Enough with the emails! G.W. Bush lost 22 000 000 emails and noone tried to send him to prison. Yes  I've been a Republican for almost 40 years and I will proudly be voting for that "Nasty" woman!,?
8848,I know its exactly the same with the morons who conflate footballers and football.,?
8849,The day you finally do some research on why Obama's ban was significantly different than Trump's ban is the day you'll also discover why Trump's ban was ruled unconstitutional and Obama's wasn't.   I'll get your research started for you: Obama's ban didn't single out or prioritize based on religion. Trump's had a Christian preference.   But of course  Obama was a constitutional scholar and lawyer  and Trump is just a bumbling idiot.,?
8850,I get your point  but yes it's about money  thats the definition of the conversation. The PFD is a state savings account  that we've allowed people to essentially have money out of  and now people are fixated on their "right" to it. Instead of allowing sound fiscal policy like "hey  the state's broke  we made cuts  but we need savings too  we're gonna use PF earnings" they whine that they don't get 'their' money.  As such as we should buy out the PFD to all Alaskans  and if we want a college funding option  lets re-designate say  5% of earnings to scholarship funding for the UA system  and a further 5% to reducing tuition prices and expanding offerings into law and medicine. The end result is we encourage more students to stay here in Alaska and prevent brain drain.,?

That a majority of voters choose either a complete clown or a fringe candidate with no chance leaves me with total disinterest (OK  OK  some repulsion I admit) about the opinion of our southern neighbors.

8860,I read somewhere that prior to 2009  teams stayed in the locker room and prepared for the game and only came out for the National Anthem during Super Bowls.  They didn't care about the Star Spangled Banner and Old Glory unless the Zoomies flew over the stadium with the world watching.  Is the President forcing them to decide to fight this battle on the sidelines or just stay inside instead again and make it an even bigger non-issue?  I could be wrong but that patriotic Clear Channel owned blowtorch KOA doesn't even stay on the air for this event and cuts to commercials instead.  Maybe they have changed but I know they didn't used to.  I stopped listening to them even though Dave Logan is better than Phil Simms when I emailed them about why they don't broadcast the National Anthem a few years ago.

8863,Well here we go again. Let's give the Liberals a standing ovation for being able to balance their operating expenses for the first time in a decade. However  instead of plowing the savings into our ballooning $312B - that's a B for Billions - deficit  they offer us trinkets and blankets paid for with our own money. Wynne and her rag tag army of tax and spend specialists need to be shown the door.,?

8865,Nobody said anything of the sort. If the woman wants to eliminate the problem of people looking then she has the power to stop that.  Any fool knows 50% of men look at naked women on the  internet  and the same is going to apply in the workplace or out in public. You are simply raising up a ridiculous strawman argument and knocking it over. And nobody has ever said the Lieutenant was justified  this is just your schizophrenic  hypocritical  Christianaphobic personality rearing it ugly head.

8870,I agree with everything you say about Bannon  but would respectfully submit that you're wrong about Trump. He's anything but anyone's useful idiot. He possesses a keen political instinct that has gotten him out of every bind and allows him to land on his feet stronger than ever whenever the going gets rough. He has street smarts - you'll have to give him that  and I do so begrudgingly. Combine that with Bannon's cunning and proven ability to foment the basest emotions among the lowest wrung of the lowest common denominator  and you have a combo truly made in hell. Welcome to hell.,?

8872,Trump said he was smart when Hillary accused him of not paying any federal taxes for some previous years.  So what does this make those of us that pay taxes?  Dumb.  Trump's responds are his worse enemy.  He is absolutely too dumb to be President.  Hillary is too much of a liar and crook to be President.   If this pair is the best our system can produce we are in serious trouble.,?

8878,The debt ceiling is an artificial constraint to federal spending imposed by Congress.  Exceeding it will have no negative consequences on the economy.  As the sovereign issuer of the US dollar  the federal government can create and spend as much money as it wants to and give it to someone  per former Fed Chair Alan Greenspan.    Furthermore  unlike a currency user such as a private household or business  a state or local government or a nation like Greece  the US government can never go broke involuntarily.  It also doesn't need to tax or borrow in order to fund spending.    The only natural constraint to federal spending is inflation which is a result of too much money (demand) chasing too few resources.  Such resources include oil  food  cars  houses  land or people  and is where real inherent value lies. Our federal taxes help keep inflation under control by removing excess dollars from the economy  thus giving it value.  A resource limit would be better than a debt limit IMO.,?

8883,John Gibbons is a terrible manager  will add to my already quite-lengthy list of head-scratchingly dumb decisions.  Friday's game  top of the 9th  5-1 Min  runners on the corners  1 out.  Gibbons draws the infield in  to cut off the run at the plate  rather than playing DP depth  which is a no-brainer in that situation.  So  what happens?  Batter hits a low liner over the ss for an rbi single which he most certainly catches if he's where he shoulda been.  So  OK  big deal  his defenders say  you lose by 4  you lose by 5  no diff.  Agreed--so why draw the infield in then?  His defenders can't have it both ways.  That 6th run obviously mattered very much to Gibbons.  And the question  which was never asked  never discussed  never brought up  that needs to be put to Gibbons  is why?  Maybe it makes no diff in that situation  but if you cannot even get that right  why would anyone trust his impulse when it really does matter?,?

Anyone who reads the news knows that "modern anti-globalist nationalism" is about increasing the wealth and incomes of the 1% at the expense of the rest of us.  Academic research ignores this point at its peril!,?
8892,I think I agree with you Andrew.  The Bush clan have long memories and they do 'pay backs'.  We may even find out that the whole Iraq war was sold by Cheney to GW as payback for  Saddam Hussein's  assassination attempt on George H. Bush.

8915,Truly the left wing needs to move along  America 1st and government that represent the forgotten people is truly music to anybody who feels left out and helpless.

Prohibition is not a sufficient means to reduce abortion  but it's surely a helpful one.  And since there's no reason not to use all reasonable means to reduce abortion  foregoing prohibition would be irrational.   If you believe abortion is wrong  it's bound to be because you believe a human life has been taken   What could justify that?,?

8933,Do you really want to poke a raging bull (sh***er) in the eye?  Especially one who controls the most powerful country in the world.  That is what Ms. Wendt was getting at  I believe. Nothing good will come of that. Trump is not a conservative in any sense. Ms. Wndt  no doubt  finds him objectionable on that basis.  I think Trump is mentally ill  in a clinical sense.  I suppose that rampant narcissism and pathological lying is a mental disease in itself  but I am talking about a far deeper and fundamental mental illness.  He really needs to be examined.  He is sick. You need to play jujitsu with him.  Use his weaknesses against him  rather than playing his game.   It would be interesting to see his cabinet invoke the 25th Amendment of the American Constitution (never been done before).  But that would give us President Pence. He is scary in another way  but at least he is a traditional conservative who is not likely to do totally crazy things. We can deal with that.,?

Even the idiot democrats admit that Obama overreached with DACA. DACA was meant to be temporary. Trump just gave them six months.,?

8968,Please enlighten the rest of us about your assertion that said judge is "neatly in the pocket of" Liberals and the companies you cite. Facts please; bald assertions from your couch won't cut it with people who have half a brain. Your comment implies that this particular judge somehow benefits financially or in some other way by reaching the conclusion he came to. On the face of it  it appears you make your assertions based solely on the fact that you personally don't agree with the judge's decision. In your view  is it even remotely possible that the judge actually did the job courts are supposed to do  namely to exercise their legitimate role as interpreters of the Constitution's language and as a check and balance to the Executive Branch and Congress? If the District Court judge's ruling is wrong  the Federal Appeals Court and perhaps even the SCOTUS will overrule him. That's how our legal system works.,?

8971,"I am fighting every day for the ppl of this country"???? that is funny. With that said  Im opposed to paris  just like Kyoto. Both were bad accords.  Instead  we need to tax all consumed goods/services based on where the worst part/service (in terms of CO2) comes from.   If done right  it would force ALL states/nations to clean up at the same time  while rewarding those that are already low emitters.   Just need 2 things: 1) to put OCO-3 sat in orbit to measure all the nations with the same instruments.  2) to base the tax on emissions / $GDP and NOT emissions / capita. The reason is that businesses and gov are the ones that make choices about coal plants and vehicles being made available. In general  ppl do not have a say in emissions.,?

Than you for your ongoing writing and public intellectual voice that inspires many Canadians as well as many around the world who have read your work in translation. Your recent mobilizing intervention in the post-Trump era shows us how important it is that we think through how we intervene right now.,?

8989,It took Trump a few minutes to issue his statement condemning Harvey.  The left said his response wasn't fast enough  which means he actually supports hurricanes.,?
8990,Excellent points. The majority of the Russians in Latvia were imported into Latvia as part of Russian genocide in Latvia. For them to consider Russia liberated Latvia from the Germans is just Russian propaganda. The Russians have obliterated from their history books the fact that Russians as part of their genocide program also deported thousands of Lithuanians  Latvians and Estonians from their homes in the middle of the night to Siberia in 1941  1945 and 1949.,?
8991,Unfortunately  I believe him  mostly (inflation and interest rates can do significant things to housing affordability  and therefore prices).  I have no expectation of housing returning to affordability in the near term.  Also unfortunately  the businesses doing most of the hiring don't need laid off aerospace workers  and the small amount of rehiring Boeing is doing doesn't come close to how much they've downsized over the last few years.  Be careful about the games you play with your employer. They can also hire from out-of-state if you get too greedy  and as we all know  one giant employer is looking to focus their future growth elsewhere with a second headquarters. It's also interesting that this same employer is still not discussing that its competitors are starting to figure out increasingly effective responses to the disruption it created in their shared market  which could significantly change their fortunes in the next few years.,?

8994,Mr Summers:  You are living proof that we are in an era when the message is irrelevant.  All that matters is the messenger.  If I consider myself to be on the right wing  then anything said by a fellow right-winger is  by definition  correct and okay and everything said by a left-winger is  by definition  stupid  foolish and unworthy of consideration.  The same is true of left-wingers.  It does not matter the message.  It does not matter if it's the same message from both sides.  It's so much easier to claim the person is a stupid head than to actually think.  Thinking is hard.,?

9015,To me the most significant problem is the school system.  We don't seem to prioritize it.  I also don't like the city counsel ignoring both sides on many issues.  The political bias and stiffneckedness is so significant that all the people feel they are listened to and considered in decision making.  It is not balanced from a governance perspective whatsoever.  I think we are probably closer to 50/50 in terms of conservative vs. liberal.  Yet our city council seems to primarily represent the 50% liberal perspectives.  I always hope that the blinders will come off  but they don't seem to.,?
9016,I'm a bit baffled by how it is condescending to objectively reference things like "there's racism/sexism here" or "that paper has a lot of typos in it." It's possible to describe things without judging them. Seems to be that's exactly what the author has done.,?
9017,So the police arrested only pro-democracy protesters not the pro-China ones  eh.

9018,I continue to be troubled that Civil Beat is covering for Djou by refusing to identify Djou as the author and chief advocate of the legislation which created HART.  Djou created HART.  Djou gave HART a blank check.  Djou gave HART the authority to build 34 miles of heavy rail from Costco in Kapolei to Waikiki and UH Manoa.  For a VERY brief moment in time  Djou voted against rail.  But then he became the most pro-rail member of the City Council.  He supports Transit Oriented Development.  He supported spending a fortune on rail by moving the route from Salt Lake to the more expensive Airport option.  And  to top it all off  Djou pushed for the creation of HART (and its powerless board of directors) which REMOVED RESPONSIBILITY for the rail project from City Hall and put this responsibility entirely in the hands of the newly-created HART bureaucracy.  HART is Djou's Obamacare.  The mismanagement of rail and the cost overruns and the blank check DEMAND context:  Djou is HART's founder.,?
9019,Guy Caron has the policy substance and direction that we need to face the oncoming environmental and economic crises. He's genuine  intelligent  warm  and most importantly has the economic credentials necessary for a leftist candidate to present his ideas. He's well spoken and fluent in both official languages  the importance of which cannot be understated. He would dance circles around Trudeau in a debate and put his empty platitudes to shame. I think that even conservatives would warm to Caron because of how much clear sense he make and his expertise on the subjects which matter to them and to most Canadians. There would be a clear contrast between Caron and platitude-reliant Trudeau. The others less so (although I'd still likely support them)  and definitely not Singh.,?

9025,If you cut corporate taxes they are just going to start giving out raises to everyone?   If you are foolish enough to believe that you deserve whats coming to you.  Corporations are already sitting on mountains of cash  there is zero evidence that making those mountains bigger is going to lead to more income for the average American.  The Trump administration is counting on your stupidity.,?
9026,agree.  It was a cute but silly statement from a dude who  is none too intelligent.,?
9027,Huge corporate entities are creating a poor middle class. In the race for profit margins to keep investors happy  the common worker is being exploited out of a basic lifestyle. There has to be a change in how the money/wealth is distributed. Having a livable wage for workers who produce value is far more important than the syphoned off profits to speculators who add absolutely NO value whatsoever. Basically the economy is becoming a mere Ponzi scheme; only the people at the very top make money. Change the tax to avoid these monopolies that have put small local businesses out of the market. Globalization merely is hides slave labour in foreign countries so the cost to consumers is lower  but it will have everyone eventually either out of a job  or on a poverty income. Foreign supply side economics will collapse local  provincial  then federal economies. Buy local  buy farmers markets buy from local craftsmen.,?

No  people should not lose their right to privacy because they're having a mental health crisis and are also poor.

You know  BLM and the Nazis are not equivalent. Quit trying to pretend they are. It makes it look as though you're defending White Supremacists  the KKK (Trump's  dad was a member) and Neo Nazis.

9057,You may not agree with the judge about who removed the clothing  but it's his call.  And - as said above - it's hard to do that without touching her.  Not being picky  just correcting your statement about "no evidence the cabbie ever even touched her."    You also said that they never had sex in this case.  From the evidence it appears the cabby was prevented from going further by the arrival of police - but removing her panties is enough sex to constitute sexual assault - if consent were absent.  And that was the issue.  You say that his DNA was not found on her. I don't see that in the decision; can you tell me where it is?,?
9058,"They’re mostly uneducated hicks who are just following the loud bully around the schoolyard. They have no issues with corporations and obviously worship the super-wealthy."  I see  Hire  that you have absolutely no respect for those that disagree with you  but you denigrate them as uneducated and hicks as well?  Well  good for you  sir/madam.  That simple  though moronic statement sums up so much of the elitist attitude towards the simple man  or woman  or both  simply attempting to make their own way through life as they see fit  without relying upon the omnipresent overseers to determine what said  individuals may  or may not engage within  so as to make their own lives  and the lives of their own families better.  You may be surprised at how many of the "hicks" are not only well educated  but hold unto well paying jobs  such as tradesmen and tradeswomen within the mechanical  electrical  and plumbing fields  that make far more than your "educated" class.  You are a moronic bigot.,?

I am crushed to hear of disasters and wars in other nations that slaughter thousands if not millions.    But if I open myself deeply to that pain  I just don't feel strong enough to avoid being overwhelmed.       Part of conservative doctrine is the knowledge that a single individual has control of their destination  and in many cases that may well be true.   What is lost in that idealogy is that every society has social structure which may well present VERY unequal opportunity to happiness.   Those large social structures are seldom overcome with individual effort.   Institutional racism has been part of American history.     And while the formal acceptance of those racist policy may be gone for the most part  the emotional imprinting of grandparent  parents  friends certainly keeps racism alive at the individual level.

9092,I'm sorry that you were called nasty names by a moron.....and I appreciate what you have done.....but here's the deal from my perspective.....  There is an assumption by many that cops always close ranks around their own.  Prior to getting into education  I was going to go the Criminal Justice route.  This concept was mentioned in my first CJ class  so I do know it exists to some extent.  I had classes with many that had no business being cops.....and I imagine that at least a few of them became cops.  I now refer to those people as "George Zimmermans".  Even though the cop in Ferguson was cleared (rightfully so  if you ask me)  a DOJ report found a number of smelly things going there with regards to its police department and city government and their interaction with the black community.  I don't recall any law enforcement people publicly urging Ferguson to clean up its mess.  Very few in law enforcement speak against instances of brutality....and I see that as an issue.,?

9099,Censorship is used to silence dissenting views.  All comments are closed  which means ADN is not subversively promoting those with a different opinion than you.    Many online news outlets occasionally close comments (or just don't open them) when the content is likely to devolve into racial or bigoted hysterics.  I've even seen it many times on Fox News  of all places  where many comment threads include KKK level nonsense.  Yet some stories elicit threads too vile even for them.  ADN is making an effort to improve the civility of the conversation.  The problem is  some stories elicit a high degree of incivility from otherwise civil citizens.  ADN is taking the easy way out here  but I don't really blame them.  They don't have the staff or inclination to moderate these topics  so they very occasionally take a pass.,?

9105,Klastri  in August 2016  three days of heavy rains brought historic flooding to Louisiana.  Thirty parishes were declared disaster areas  and at least 13 people died. The Coast Guard and other first responders rescued more than 20 000 people  as the massive flooding inundated areas in and around Baton Rouge. More than 70 000 people registered for federal disaster assistance and more than 9 000 filed flood insurance claims.  With an estimated 40 000 homes damaged by deadly flooding  Louisiana was facing its biggest housing crunch since Hurricane Katrina a decade earlier.  People whose homes were swamped by some of the heaviest rains Louisiana has ever seen are staying in shelters  bunking with friends or relatives  or sleeping in trailers on their front lawns.  Obama was on vacation on Martha’s Vineyard while this was happening and he showed his empathy for the people of Louisiana by playing golf with his friends.  And you call Trump a loathsome scumbag.

9120,Another loss for Trump and the Republicans.  Meanwhile  Trump is going to be on his knees kissing the President of China's rear end. Trump is a weak and vain President. During the campaign  he talked about labelling China as a currency manipulator in order to preserve and create jobs in the United States. And he has not changed NAFTA either. So Trump is a liar and a blowhard.,?
9121,We'll need showers and a covered cooking facility  maybe a laundry area and of course free wi-fi.,?
9122,Time for sunny boy to join our American friends in this.,?
9123,I understand your concern.  I don't agree with HSTA's plan to raise money for education  but I do feel there needs to be some creative solutions to the housing problems.  I find a comparison to a one child China policy a bit extreme and a Berkeley rent control model more appropriate.  You can still enjoy the fruits of your labors  it's just more costly.  I'll give up my need  to have a second home if it means more quality . housing and solid  connected communities.  The current property value increases will not lead to a livable Hawaii.  Those new investment property homes at the new prices also pass the cost to their renters.  Maybe tax breaks to homes that rent long term at prices Hawaii residents can manage.  But I believe we're at a tipping point  maybe we've passed it  but the status quo you mention isn't going to cut it anymore,?
9124,so  are you morons happy about his visit?,?

9128,Valleyisle57>  Either you're stupid or beyond being able to comprehend what is being said  then please shut up your FOOL TRAP!!!!  Say whatever you want about the POTUS  it's your right to do so  but remember this if you can  he is the President of the United  States of America.  You and nobody else can change that for it is a FACT!!!!  Lie all you want  create fake news if you're capable  but HE is the POTUS  remember that because it is a FACT!!!!  Can you comprehend this FACT  fool????,?
9129,Beth - Thanks for the reply.    I think if you re-read the article carefully you will see that while the AG & the Governor would love the appeal to die for their own partisan reasons  the legal advice is pretty clear that the House has the power to add itself as a party.  The problem  however  is that one representative can't just go out and add the House to a lawsuit.  There has to be some evidence that the House actually wants to be added.,?
9130,what BS excuse is that? Nu uh  screwing over Canadians is stupid. Our dollar is also kept artificially low for trade deals rendering the whole Canadian public a third world nation for foreign companies  it's beyond stupid and wrong.,?
9131,I drive the streets of Eugene every day  and I am appalled by the bad driving  regardless of whether a cell phone is involved.  It is illegal to turn right against a red traffic light when cars are approaching from your left who have a green light. (Tuesday a guy did that with me approaching and I had to swerve into another lane to avoid him as I laid on the horn. He apologized by showing his middle finger.)  It is illegal to drive in a two-way left-turn lane except for the purpose of slowing down and perhaps stopping to make a left turn. (Wednesday I gestured to someone passing me and others at 30 mph in the middle lane to slow down because somebody was pulling out of a driveway into their path. She did slow  but screamed at me  even though her window was closed and I couldn't hear her obscenities.)  It is illegal to enter an intersection on a green light if you can't exit before it turns red (also witnessed as recently as Wednesday).,?
9132,"Barack Obama is returning to Chicago where he launched his unlikely political career to tell Americans not to lose faith in their future  no matter what they think about their next president."  If he actually states something to this effect in his speech he will seal his place in history as the greatest "divider in chief". But then again  why should he change at this late juncture?,?
9133,Shit  while we're at it  let's chop off their hands.,?
9134,The oil price is not low. It has increased from $26 to $50. It costs less than $5 to produce a barrel of oil Iraq.,?
9135,I am a gay man  chaste & celibate  with "tendencies" rather than just an orientation or supposed "disorder"  and a former priest. The dearth of celibate integrated fellow priests was largely why I left active ministry. My experience is that gay priests tend to be more sexually active than straight priests  although both (forgive the binary constructs) are at least periodically active and to a staggering extent. Solid accounts by rare seminary or chancery personnel underline this reality. Yes  concupiscence is a function of humanity  so let's start such conversations by being compassionate and  where required  forgiving. But we must also acknowledge that the sideways living of enough priests  and the bishops who manage them and who themselves live less than integrated lives  give cover to those in their ranks who engage in criminal  and not merely immoral  behavior. You're only as sick as your secrets; an elite hierarchy calling out this phenomenon as a disorder is more than ironic.,?
9136,Oh okay  well if he's only as racist  sexist  misogynist  and bigoted as Mitt Romney or John McCain then I guess he can't be that bad.,?
9137,Glad to hear it work out.  I also know someone a few years back who rented instead of owning a property.  The property has appreciated around 70% so that seemed like a terrible decision.  However  his investment portfolio grew so much that he can buy the exact same property with cash instead of still having a mortgage.  For him  renting made a lot of sense.  That person was me.,?

9142,Topic:  limitation on high capacity magazines.  Position by firearms industry:" The National Shooting Sports Foundation  the firearms industry trade group  opposes such laws. It has argued that the rules infringe on the rights of law-abiding citizens and do little to prevent crime."  Meaning:  Damn it   it would cut into our profits.  Message:  Profits are more important than lives.   Response:  Magazine limitations would  at the very least  decrease the carnage                       Lives are more important than the profits of the firearms industry.                       It's damn well time we find the courage to "take on" the firearms industry.  Effect:  At some point a meaningful and successful effort to  at least  reduce the lethality of the firearms available to Americans.     Wishful thinking?   Gary Crum,?

9165,That reminds me of the time I called APD about some drunk idiot who was following me around trying to get me to pull over and fight him. APD told me I was on my own-literally. I will never trust my safety to law enforcement. Bad news for the next idiot-a grave.,?

9168,Greg Imig and Amy DeWitt left the state months and months ago. I find it interesting that this happened 18 hours before they were scheduled to appear in court. This trial has been pushed back multiple times. The defendants have YET to make a court appearance. Many of the victims in Willow had no chance to get ANYTHING from their homes before they burned to the ground. The first responder  whose own home burned while he was fighting the fire  changed a trip to testify at this trial. It's frustrating because none of that seems to matter. Yes  I'm angry. I don't expect justice to be served  but I was ready to finally make my statement and hope for some closure. 17 and 1/2 months and counting...,?

9181,He's a coward; no surprise there.,?
9182,I like your point about conservatives and government.  Reminds me: back in the '60s  some wise person commented: 'If anarchists ever do succeed in destroying the establishment  they will find themselves needing to become that which they just tore down'.  I'm wondering if conservatives have become that out of touch with reality.,?
9183,There seems to be more brain dead idiots on the loose daily.,?
9184,No  you are wrong. You are rude and ignorant that Native Alaskans have for centuries regulated their own fishing and done very well with it. The Elders understood and established the rules. The current system and treaty don't work. It is apparent that if you are listening to Dan Fagan  you are the ignorant one in this conversation. Most Native Alaskans live a subsistence lifestyle and need the fish to survive. This was their land a long time before a white person ever set foot here and all they ask is that their tradition to live off the land continue. The problem is  racists like you want them to change their tradition to "Hamburger Helper" instead of eating traditional foods. I suggest you look up the definition of racist...your feelings of superiority are showing.,?
9185,It seems that the cons always ignore the disaster that was Mike Harris. Harris deleted or downloaded on the municipalities most of provincial responsibilities. He sold off valuable assets--most prominently the 407 (100 year lease). In short  he all but gutted the Province of Ontario  while still managing to add $42 billion to the provincial debt and leaving a huge mess that is still being repaired. Unless the PCs are willing to run a leader who is not just another adherent of the mindless "Common Sense Revolution " they will never be in power again.,?
9186,What a despicable  filthy post. Apparently the murderer did support Sanders -- but he was also a White Nationalist and an anti-Muslim bigot. However  apart from his political or religious views  or his emotional and mental problems  what kind of person gloats about the murders and the murderer? A truly filthy  despicable post. http://www.denverpost.com/2017/05/27/portland-train-murder-suspect-white-nationalist/,?
9187,With jerks like this prof  our UAA system is doomed. His peers should work to get him out of the university ASAP.  Stupid is as stupid does. I'd bet this man thinks he's a real sophisticated  highly educated man. Wow  his common sense must have disappeared if it ever existed  maybe he's eating his paints?,?
9188,This report sounds like it is made up? What are these numbers based on? What did it cost to come up with this B.S.?  According to estimates the population of Vancouver in 2015 was 2 million 500 thousand. Is he suggesting that almost half the population could possibly die or become ill.? WOW!,?
9189,I hope every day for the rest of his life is misery for this murderer. Two families have to live everyday without their husband and father due to the decision of this racist criminal to shoot them in the back. To bad the father is not incarcerated for life also. Neither one deserves to live with the good people in our communities. They have proven this.,?

9191,Are we seeing evidence that Justin is a both an influence-peddling crook and treasonous in selling Canada out to a thinly-disguised communist enemy waging economic war on Canada and the entire West?  That someone so lacking in moral fibre  a failure in everything he touched before he was anointed by a cynical and corrupt Liberal party -- could have been allowed to hijack the leadership of this country makes a damning statement on our political system.  Canadians will be watching the United States closely  for if President-Elect Donald Trump succeeds in delivering on only a fraction of his promises  we will be demanding the removal of the garbage we have in Ottawa  and either seeking a complete re-working of our antiquated and dysfunctional system of government -- or as many Westerners are discussing  union with our closest friend  ally and largest trading partner  the United States.,?

9196,And as the barnacles were removed the holes were revealed and the barque started to leak and list. There was a rumour at the weekend that Misericordia et Miseria was going to announce a rapprochement with the SSPX. Thankfully bishop Fellay was not duped. Pope Francis will not get his hands on the SSPX like he did with the Friars of the Immaculate. The SSPX is the lifeboat for when or if the barque goes under.,?

9203,Dick   You in Virginia makes everything in Alaska just a little better.

9208,Oahuan is right.  Trump holds grudges and the first then he can do that is perfectly legal and justified is to get back at Hawaii by shutting down all federal funds to the Oahu train to nowhere project that is completely out of federal compliance and demand Hawaii return all federal money.  AND he can release the federal findings of the Oahu rail project as the complete money wasting FAILURE that is to the nation and the world just to embarass Hawaii gov't officials who oppose him  and that will be his response to Hawaii filng suit against his new travel ban executive order.  Actually for Hawaii residents that is a good thing cause then Kirk will have no choice but to raise everyone's property taxes through the roof and accelerate the bankruptcy of the city of Honolulu which will hurt everyone to the point that many people will stop acting like sheep and rise up to end this stoopid  wasteful train to nowhere project once and for all.,?
9209,About time. Auto workers and pensioners shoud pay tax on their vehicle discounts. Employees working for universities get free tuition for their children and themselves  should pay taxes on that benefit. Definitely tax discounted mortgages as taxable benefit. Tax auto workers free pension health coverage benefit also.,?
9210,I take it as a response to Zilla's tweet. Both equally offensive  as was the DA's response  (surprised the ANC didn't turn the no-confidence vote like the DA did). BLF though is a bunch of immoral shit-stirrers.,?

However  it will no longer be necessary to transfer the tons and tons of trash they have been dumping at Glennwood.  That's a very big difference.  Re: Lane Forest Products:  I use LFP extensively  for both yard waste and wooden construction waste.  What a wonderful success story the company is.  A great business plan.  A great facility.  Great service.  You're right.  When you back up to unload yard clippings  etc  an employee is right there with the big hood-rake to assist you.    If you'r at LFP and see an old guy standing back out of the way while some young employee empties his trailer for him  be sure to wave.    Regards  GAry,?

9219,LOL Birds of a feather flock together. How quickly Canadians forget what a hateful liar Mulroney was  the PM who turned Canadians dishonest  greedy and corrupt.,?
9220,I can't imagine how this can be considered a trans-party ticket. Kasich is more of a Democrat than most Democrats (need some more Fed cash for your state's Medicaid coffers Guv?) and Hickie Baby is a raging liberal in Howdy Dowdy clothing (just check out his charitable donations to The Chinook Fund).  It's kind of like "Dumb and Dumber" except we can call this ticket from hell "Left and Lefter."  Well actually  either title would be suitable.,?
9221,I'm not sure what point the article is trying to make.  But if a person wants to speak pidgin whenever he/she wants  I don't see a problem.  Of course  on the mainland  he/she may not be understood  or may even be asked what language is it.  Might be embarrassing.,?
9222,"And a whole heap of BC voters care about the 'liberal' misnomer. If you lived here  you'd know that."  Ha.   A whole heap of NDP voters  maybe (and even so  I doubt it).  16 years of Liberal rule proves a majority of BC voters had no such qualms at all.  The Socreds were the party of the right in BC  and Alberta for that matter.  When the brand eventually became a liability  the right morphed into the Liberals in BC and the Conservatives in Alberta  and have done pretty well for the most part since then.     You want the provincial Liberals to change their name?  Join the party and start lobbying.  After all  you live there.,?

9226,Lol  your comment is silly. I have never seen an animal held above fruits and veggies. Ridiculous. I have seen snotty babies put their hands in their mouths and noses and then touch the produce and other food items. I have seen people lick their fingers  open the plastic bags and then handle the produce. I have seen people scratching their heads and then handling food items. Your food was contaminated long before service dogs were admitted to stores.,?
9227,Maybe "pathetic" is a better word than "crazy" for you and your ilk.  Hillary lost  and nothing can change that.    I read a comment elsewhere that expressed hope that there was a chance to re-do the election if Trump is impeached.  Seriously  it's time to move on.  LOL.,?
9228,And why couldn't they stand Clinton? Fake News propagated by Trump  Putin/Russia and the GOP over the years.  You can't fix stupid. The last election proves that.,?
9229,This incident is shameful! It reflects the meanness of our thinking  which is being encouraged by the authorities and their short-sighted policies. Why are we so fearful  selfish  hard-hearted? Please forgive us  Lord God  and give us clarity of vision to see beyond our own stupidity.,?
9230,To place myself in your categories (and to place a prospective candidate) I'd have to know how "anti-abortion" and "anti-contraception" would be defined.  If it means keeping abortion legal but not federally funding it  that's one thing.  If it means actively working to reduce access to the procedure  or even re-criminalizing it  that's another.  With contraception  the whole Obamacare kerfluffle had to do with funding it  especially for types some consider de facto abortive measures.    The "Why?" part of answering those categorization questions would almost certainly involve a candidate's personal views and how he/she would work to impose those views  or not  on constituents.    I'm glad to see this article and the Dem. rebuttal to Ms. West's NYT article  which I found very alarming and short-sighted.,?
9231,Sorry  the CHIP program is not vote buying garbage. It’s just one line in the sand that defines us as a civilized  compassionate society. Christ. And Paul?

Gimme a break.,?
9232,You too huh  What is it about entitled Muslim hating angry crackers that EVERYTHING in their pathetic lives revolves around oppression by Muslims and the left?

9234,She has veto power over the enactment of any Canadian law yet not a single appearance on any ballot anywhere for this unqualified political hack and without a single vote from any rank and file Canadian Subject.  Does that sound Democratic?  Is that fair?  Are Canadians too stupid to pick and vote for their own leaders?,?

9239,lol  so funny phony conservative.  What is funny as hell is that you phony republicans had 7 years to come up with a heath care plan that is great.  You didn't and even your idiot leader has admitted this. Yes we lost on Nov. 8  but you phony republicans have even lost more as now you have to defend a bunch of losers who can't even do the most basic thing.  Of course if they succeeded  would probably plunge the country into an economic crisis but that is what republicans offer.  Comedy or crisis.   Enjoy phony conservative.,?
9240,Because these "plans " etc. would not be effective and are NOT bona fide.  The American Medical Association  among other authorities  has called the GOP and Trump  on this anomaly!,?

The legislators have been wallowing in excess per diem for years.  Is a 75% cut too much?  I don't know.  But they certainly should not be getting any higher per diem than other state employees.  Every legislator should have to pull their belt a couple notches tighter  not just the Juneau ones.,?

9274,Nothing wrong with my reading skills Cuevas. Indeed  unlike you  I even comprehend what I read.  For example  KOL withdrew because he realized he would never win enough Quebec seats in a general election to allow him to become PM. There is little doubt in his mind or in the minds of others that he would win the CPC leadership contest. According to the polls he was the frontrunner.  Hence my factual comment that the CPC party had "embraced" him.,?
9275,I see the Liberal spin machine is already working overtime to develop attacks against new CPC leader Scheer.  One of the advantages this spin machine and the war room to be set up nearer the 2019 election has over the Conservatives in terms of social media including the Globe's comments sections is that now it is normally acceptable to lie about the Conservative party  leader and policies (e.g. Scheer is a deranged  wild eyed radical social conservative impatiently waiting to impose his values on everyone else) but unacceptable to tell the truth about the Liberal party  leader and policies (e.g. Trudeau has an anorexic resume  a mediocre intellect  and is unqualified to lead a G 7 country).  This explains why my post moments ago taking issue with a Liberal spin about Scheer being merely a placeholder for the "real" leadership race between Rona Ambrose and Peter McKay in 2020 was deleted here.  It is worrisome to see how far the Globe has descended into Pom Pom Journalism for Justin.,?

Then shortly after that on civil beat Keala Kaanui says the exact verbiage( should not be tried in the court of public opinion ) not to mention  his Legal battles with Choon only a attorney would know !!

9288,The appeals court said no such thing. It simply denied his appeal. He was not entitled to a jury trial on this matter. The 9th Circuit said that Arpaio's case didn't merit the appeals court ordering the district judge to hold a jury trial. It's absurd to suggest this dismissive denial was based on Arpaio somehow being entitled to appeal for a jury trial AFTER a bench trial finding. That's just absurd on its face.,?

Basically  Obama has put the U.S. at nuclear risk starting to equal that of the Cold War  has brought the world closer to an all out nuclear war in the middle east and on his arrogant way out gives Israel's enemies even more encouragement to go after Israel.  The man is a dangerous fool - good riddance to him.,?
9291,Crooked Cricket  That's why it's harder to deal with the stupid people as compared to evil people.  Evil people know what they do and why they do it.

9292,All the women who voted for Trump are derided as being only men . All the blacks who voted for Trump are summarily dismissed as white. All the gays who voted for Trump are condescended to as being ignorant uneducated  straight males.  That is the homophobia  racism and misogyny you should be talking about.  The left is the bastion of hatred and intolerance.,?
9293,Hard to say who is using whom. Narcissists think themselves smarter than everyone else and that describes not only Trump but also these "preachers" of the "prosperity gospel" who enriched themselves  not their flock. Trump likes to bamboozle his customers and I think he sees these "religious" as a customer base who are all too willing to buy his nonsense. They made a Faustian bargain and more and more people are seeing through this. This might play to the base of the credulous but mainstream Americans know these folks just want to satiate their lust for power and couldn't care less abut any of Christ's teachings.,?
9294,Yet you all want Muslims in Canada who mutilate  beat  and kill women for being women and make them walk around like animals. Bring your culture and misogyny says Jughead...

BTW where are the narco-fems and anti-farts on this issue?  They like Muslim desecration of women do they? Now if it was Trump well then.... Where are the marches and baseball bats people?

9306,Another consideration... you don't want this entire starting secondary getting old at about the same time.  Harris is 28  Stewart 29  Ward 30  and Talib 31.    Even though Talib has 2 more years on his contract after this year  at $12M/yr and age 32 next year  there's no guarantee they keep him if he starts showing any signs of slowing down (we saw that with Champ in his last couple of years).  In order to keep the whole unit strong  you want to maintain continuity.  Which means not replacing more than one starter at a time  ideally about 2 years apart.    Simmons (23) taking over for Ward now gives him 1-2 years as a starter before the next cog in the wheel needs replacing (likely Talib).  As Elway has said  it's not just about winning "now"  it's about winning "now on".,?

Most experienced reporters are sensitive to the constraints  police are under when they are in the middle of trying to get witnesses to come forward to help them solve a crime..  I share your belief that HPD's media training should have been done by an organization more in tune with the special challenges of police work and knowledge of HPD's longtime culture of secrecy above ---  Honolulu Police Department's  hunkered down mind set that goes way beyond the normal constraints needed to protect the integrity of any investigation.,?

9338,There is no such thing as 'limited war'. Even the smallest act of war comes with many blowbacks and unintended consequences. Reagan bombed Libya; a few years later Libya bombed a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie Scotland.   Was the invasion of Iraq a 'limited war'? At the time  they kept telling the public it was 'time bound' and 'limited' and here we are in 2017 and they are still fighting there.   Militarily  the Canadian Armed Forces are not a factor or game-changer. It is actually dangerous if they go into real combat with their equipment as it is now. During the Iraq invasion of 2003  the British were not ready and they started the war with their helicopters flying into each other and many other fatal accidents getting off the start line.,?

9346,the fact that they are legal is why they are called loopholes. If they were illegal it would be considered tax circumvention/evasion which is a crime. The Liberals backed off their measures because Paul Ryan - the GOP speaker took command of the tax reform ship over Trump and unlike Obamacare repeal and replace is going to pass his reform. US is going to have post card style tax returns for individuals (no need to pay an accountant  tax filer or use software anymore). Less brackets and deductions for a simpler system with uniform rates. US is cutting the corporate tax and deductions for both small business and major corporations and they may later go back to repealing Obamacare which would make them a major threat to steal Canadian jobs like never before especially during tense nafta re-negotiations.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03XuH1Vh0CY,?
9347,Isn't this what novelists have always done  i.e. imagine  create  and depict people other than the novelist  often including people of different ethnicities and CULTURES? That's partly what imaginative (fiction) writing's about  isn't it?    "Fake Indian" Joseph Boyden's  big error was not that  he wrote (well received) novels about first nations people  but that he falsely claimed to have some native ancestry himself - and perhaps worse: he became a public spokesperson (interviews  speaking gigs) speaking on native issues while pretending he himself was part native.   Novelists should be allowed to imagine and write about who and what ever they want to  so long as they don't make false claims (as Boyden did) about their own supposed ancestral connections to people or cultures they write about.   Political correctness has turned lunatic.,?
9348,Interestingly  the better way to stay informed about your investments is to simply not look.  Statistically  buy and hold investors that don't follow the market daily have higher rates of return than those that monitor the markets daily.  Buy-and-holders are more likely to make conscious long term decisions and not react to buying and selling on the whims of the market.  Those that look daily are likely to do the opposite.  So if you want higher RoR  investigate and buy something if it's a deal  but then stop looking at it.  Daily ups and downs are quite meaningless.,?

You have no problem with excessive fines. Why not bring back the pillories in the public square? If we had the kind of deterance you call for  there would be barbaric levels of executions.  The kind of extreme justifications you all have offered here for your so called deterence are the same kind of stupid and dangerous excuses that will lead to midemeanors being punished by summary execution. The level of cult brainwashing is extreme. The state and the law enforcement defend mega criminals and do not defend the public interest.

9363,The Donald made a major mistake when he decided to just let republicans in congress draft the bill.  He should have come out in favor of Medicare for all.

Come on Donald  can't you live up to at least one campaign promise?,?
9364,"Lefty fascists" is an oxymoron  and would be laughable except for the hatred implicit in its expression.  Clinton  if a liar  is an ordinary one  like the husband  for instance  who tells his wife "No dear  that dress doesn't make you look fat."  I think you make your incorrect claim to deflect from what is the undeniable truth  that Donald Trump lies shamelessly and nonstop  to appeal to the intellectually and morally challenged among us.  Your biggest lie here is in saying that Clinton "has broken numerous federal statutes" and has committed a felony.  Both accusations are falsehoods  neither is true.  You are free to decorate your own home and mind with the calculated falsehoods of your right-wing propagandists  but if you try to hang that ugly wallpaper here  expect to be told to take it elsewhere  it is too ugly for public display.,?
9365,I think nowadays most people prefer the self-service lane.,?
9366,The more recent news about Debbie Wasserman Schultz seems much more promising for actual crimes committed. Are you paying attention to that?,?
9367,If you worship any type of god  you are a hypocrite and also an airhead based on your logic.,?
9368,You don't have to watch very hard to see missiles shot over neighbouring countries as NK has done. When did Iran do that exactly?,?
9369,My comment was NOT a sexist comment. I would say the exact same thing with Norm Chow who at a certain point had to take care of his ailing wife.  However with Chow he had the additonal burden of not being a good head coach  regardless of his family situation.,?
9370,I am all for having child rapists put down like rabid dogs.  Sorry but I have SOME compassion for the criminal who made a mistake of stealing or getting addicted to drugs who is willing to take the corrections in prison.  I don't have any for rapists.,?
9371,Mr. Clark is demonstrated a rather ridiculous level of ignorance here.  "I don't understand the concerns being raised so I'm just going to blindly claim it is due to fear and be done with it".  Question for Mr. Clark  why is our government passing *ANY* piece of legislation that singles out a single religion?  Canada already has enshrined  in our Constitution  religious freedom as well as protection from discrimination based on religion.  We already have anti-hate laws and even terrorism laws to protect against religious persecution by individuals.  This is a pointless piece of legislation that will  at best  result in a waste of money.  All we need to do is enforce laws that are already on the books.,?
9372,Junior you might want to ask a few questions before you go Merkel on us again.,?

9377,If the Human Race stopped pro-creating to the extent it does then their well being might improve. Unfortunately they are too stupid to realise that.,?
9378,If Bannon and Stephen Miller and their toadies were fired from the Trump administration and replaced by other mainstream Republicans  I believe that the policies would moderate.  Trump is basically a dumb demagogue who apparently agrees with the last thing that someone tells him.  So if the last person who tells him something is McMaster  then perhaps we don't get the Muslim ban.    And I think Burke is a fool but Bannon is using him for his own purposes.  Burke and his toadies were behind some of the dumb stunts against the pope over the last few weeks like the posters.  I don't think that Burke will be effective nor do I think that Bannon thinks he will (although Bannon wouldn't mind being rid of that meddlesome priest.)  Bannon wants Francis distracted by internal enemies so that Francis cannot do things like speak out against Trump policies or condemn the alt-right as anti-Christian.,?

9386,All finance ministers  including Morneau consult private sector economists and no  they weren't all Conservative.   Consulting is nothing like selling access to the Minister of Finance and that is what Morneau was doing,?
9387,Trudeau doesn't have the back bone to cancel the arms to Saudi Arabia deal  there is no way he will finger China  etc.   Weak  selfish  leader.   All he is focused on is boosting his ego through useless and pointless Security Council seat.,?
9388,https://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2017/08/03/disaster-maryland-county-would-lose-47-000-jobs-with-minimum-wage-hike-n2363878  "No  Seattle and New York have proven that minimum wage hikes are toxic to job creation and economic growth."  But never mind empirical data so recent  none of the mainstream media outlets have even reported on it yet.  Imagine that!  Yeah  lets use other people's money before they can figure it out that it was wrong  then work to fix it  thus ensuring employment.,?
9389,Kinda funny to see all the contortions that all the anti-Trump do to make it appear that Trump is disliked and that most do not support the Travel Ban.  Such as a poll when polls during the entire months and months before November 8 bragged that Clinton was a sure winner and Trump a sure loser.  - So  Nope. Trump supporters do not dislike Trump and support his Travel Ban. - The only people and the only people who dislike  Trump are Democrats  the liberal media  and all who voted for Clinton . - Mind you  all these character assassination of Trump and all these calls that say Trump is not fit to be president were hurled at Trump months and months before Nov. 8. But in spite of all that  Clinton lost and Trump won.   - In spite of all sorts of controversies against Trump -  Russia thing? Obstruction of Justice? Travel Ban? Etc. etc. - Trump will go on to do what he promised his supporters to do:--> "Make America Great Again".,?
9390,Lol!  Total moron.  If we evil whitey don't go  watch  or care... No $ for dem black boys.  Thanks for humoring me today!,?
9391,A single-payer system would build on Obamacare's successes. It would create a federal healthcare infrastructure that every citizen pays into and is covered by  which would allow the government to negotiate the prices of medications and medical services  thereby bringing the overall cost of healthcare down while providing coverage for everyone. Insuring the entire population lowers the costs too – with everyone paying into the system  people who need a lot of care aren’t burdened with higher premiums and healthier people have coverage when they need it. Every other industrialized nation has single-payer healthcare and pays between one and two thirds what we do for it while covering everyone. Obamacare improved our medical system  but the only way to truly fix it is to take one last step and make healthcare universal. And if nothing else  from a moral standpoint  should whether you live or die really be determined by the benefits your job gives you or how much money you have in the bank?,?
9392,More deflection from the Russian Trolls.,?
9393,Poloz and Libs have done everything they could to drive down the Canadian $...Canada is front and center on currency manipulation   climate warming  welfare  selfies.  Canadian standard of living in a tailspin as a result.,?
9394,LOL.  OK  puzzled.  I just don't have the patience.  I also hate to give Ed Hu  or RD  or whoever it is  a platform.  I find most of what they say to be so obnoxious..... But it's good to have a laugh  and you gave me one  so thank you.,?
9395,Gee  you're dumb.,?
9396,Again  the continuous lying to prop up a complete imbecile who has delivered absolutely nothing as President is amazing.  The guy has taken 55 golfing trips (WOW!) since taking office at a cost of more than $62 million.  You couldn't even make that up.,?
9397,"Again  no reasonable person could ever condone Yiannopoulos’s writings or the ideas he disseminated. Personally  I am unable to read more than a paragraph of his essays." The second sentence makes you wonder how the author could ever have come to the conclusion in the first sentence. This article is 12 paragraphs of opinion  reflexive anger  supposition and attacks that are never backed by even a single fact. That should be astonishing  sadly it isn't. As to the headline - I think the author needs to recognize that he is still in the grip of his own "screaming child that lives inside".  There are no facts and no argument  it is no more than a very dark version of the "Look at how beautiful Sophie and Justin are!" articles that populated these pages a year ago. What is the point of the Globe publishing such a rant?,?
9398,Sounds like stupid lunch time talk got taken way too seriously but who knows.,?
9399,lay it at the feet of politics perhaps  a profession filled to the brim with outsized egos....unlikely that almost anyone could immerse themselves in it and not become susceptible to its self-aggrandizing taint. .  funny though...by all accounts Minister Sajjan performed his intelligence roles with great acumen and skill while in Afghanistan  while also facing personal dangers associated with that type of engagement in theatre....he had no need to embellish to be more than credible.,?

9402,Thanks Mayor.,?
9403,Donald Trump negotiating ANY deal is a challenge. He has no political knowledge whatsoever  and the mental capacity of a 5-year-old child  so it's like negotiating with a kindergartner. It's a sad time for our country.,?

9420,Quote: "I seem to remember from my high school civics class that the First Amendment says there will be free exercise of speech and the right of the people to peaceably assemble to exercise this right."  Hmm - Berkeley  Mizzou  Yale  Evergreen  DePaul - etc.  The Leftists are so free speech they try to get everyone who disagrees with them banned by the college and if that doesn't work they forcibly interrupt the presentations.  Free speech is a two way street.  The violent leftist protesters in Chicago  San Jose  Arizona  Portland  etc - bringing bricks and bats and machetes to political demonstrations - all to assault those who have different views.  It doesn't really seem that this is as one-sided as the letter-writer would like to assume.,?

9430,Here again it's implied most Republicans in Congress kiss their wives. It's is implied that Trump was being investigated  and if he wasn't why did the Democrat and the media state ON THE RECORD  that it was the campaign being investigated? Comey himself never say it's not Trump being investigated it's the campaign The simple answer is to imply Trump is being investigated is to keep the Democrat base revved up  and we saw the melt down yesterday at a ball field. Now look at who's campaign needs to be investigated  Uncle Bernie's.,?
9431,(Part three of three)  The Register is owned by EWTN  and they  too  have not been shy about challenging Francis.

9433,"Every party has done stupid sexist s*** " Rempel tweeted. "Trying to paint it as an issue to one party or another for gain is part of the problem."  --------------------  Once again Rempel outclasses everyone.   McKenna tried for some partisan mileage out of this and thus amped up the victimization to herself by herself  far greater then the Rebel ever did.  I'm sorry Catherine  liberal women do not deserve the special treatment you so desire  that flies in the face of equality.  If as a feminist you struggle for equal treatment  you will receive the same treatment that men and other politicians receive.  For 10 years here at the G&M  Harper and his minions were on the receiving end of some of the most vile of personal attacks I've ever seen in Canada  and none of them stopped a press conference to pout about it.,?
9434,This is certainly a very sad commentary on your free speech rights people when you see this article has caused a number of comments to be removed and some users deleted or booted off the forum. The Supreme Court of Canada in a very important case ruled on section 2 of our Charter (Freedom of Expression) and Chief Justice Dickson said that political discourse should never  ever  be censored. That doesn't apply here tho because if you are not Liberal enough cut goes your post or if the liberals all gang up on you - banned!,?

9436,I don't disagree with that at all.  It seems that both sides of the political spectrum need their boogeymen.  The unfortunate thing with trying to blame Soros  is that much of it is done without proof.  At least some of the blame of the Koch Brothers is actually attributable.  They are pretty proud of what they do  Soros is more quiet  so he gets blamed for stuff that is just plain guessing as to his involvement.,?

9438,If  as you claim  "He does know what he is doing"  it sure doesn't show. His ignorance on so many issues - both foreign and domestic - is breathtaking.

He's dumb as a bag of hammers  and it shows.,?

9443,Maine (since enacting a state law in 1969) and Nebraska (since enacting a state law in 1992) have awarded one electoral vote to the winner of each congressional district  and two electoral votes statewide.     The constitutional wording does not encourage  discourage  require  or prohibit the use of any particular method for awarding a state's electoral votes.      As a result of changes in state laws enacted since 1789  the people have the right to vote for presidential electors in 100% of the states  there are no property requirements for voting in any state  and the state-by-state winner-take-all method is used by 48 of the 50 states. States can  and have  changed their method of awarding electoral votes over the years.   The National Popular Vote bill uses the built-in method that the Constitution provides for states to make changes.,?

9445,Not sure what those huge consequences would have been. We could import oil from the US and Mexico for our refineries. It's surprising that while the US is moving towards energy independence  we are importing Saudi oil.   Also  it is important to understand that the ideological source of a certain type of religious fundamentalism is Saudi Arabia. If Liberals stand for progressive values  as they claim to do  Saudi Arabia should be near the bottom of the pile of countries we do business with.,?
9446,But they better not miss paying their property taxes.  A shame that if you own land in Alaska you really dont have any say in what happens on it.  I say we start a gofundme for this couple and help pay their legal fees and maybe some extra so they can leave this crap State.,?

9449,Right....  she (and you) would've been so happy and appreciative if the books would've come from Hillary or obama.

Fire this idiot for  using her classroom and kids as a political stunt.,?

9455,At some point that whole area could use an upgraded roadway (4 lanes total most likely  up from 2)  and when they do that they need to put in a bike path along next to the highway  or a part of it like they did between Fairbanks and Ester.  How long till that happens is the question.  The DOT moves slow on things like that sometime.  The road there is extremely busy at times (I miss the days it was much slower).  Instead of projects like this  they have been dumping money in to that bridge to nowhere (which I am glad is cancelled).,?

9463,i am white. no one disputes a right to express oneself. but you ought to have a good reason if your going to do it this way. they're saying there's a problem with the country in general  not just the police or some particular issue. your saying  despite all the anti-racism efforts in this country  that this country has/is oppressing black people  and by inference you're saying the very whites in the stands are blameworthy. meanwhile whites quietly put up with the massive amount of crime blacks commit. we're absolutely disgusted.,?

9466,I thought I was all through commenting here  but then I read your "solution" to the "basic facts" problem rc.    I bet that  over the last 80 years or so  there have been hundreds of historical "advisors" attached to Hollywood movies who went away shaking their heads  or  shrugging their shoulders--but pocketing the money anyway.  This is  after all  entertainment (Oh yes it is!)   Call it..."historical fiction."  If you were literal and real  with history  most people would complain "Too gruesome!  Too boring! Too long-winded! Too downbeat!"  Professional historian as narrator?? As script writer?? To prove what  while boring our a**es off? That attitude reminds me of my factual-is-best history-loving father  who  upon leaving the movie theater after  seeing "Titanic" complained  "well  it was okay  but they threw in that silly love story."    Huh??,?

9469,OK  I hear some people throw out a "Canada is the best country in the world" line  but I've never noticed anyone taking it seriously - even the ones who say it.   Living next door to the all-powerful United States  we definitely make comparisons and many  if not most  of us believe Canada is better in most significant ways.    But basing serious political analyses on a claim that we're the best country in the world?  Not our way.,?

9475,Trump is an abject failure as president.  He can't remember things (like Sergeant Johnson's name  for instance) from one minute to the next.  It's not really any wonder how or why he continuously drove businesses into bankruptcy and insolvency.  He's been a failure and a liar his entire life.  His sycophants here lie for him  just like poor hapless Kelly does.  It's pathetic.,?

9479,And even more couldn't care less.,?
9480,Yeah  I wish there had been similar laws in place when I was little. Both my parents smoked and I just hated the smell and hated how I smelled after being in the car with them.

9484,Which all sounds tooty-fruity lefty true  until you look at Columbia.  Lots of US dollars and military aid along with a determined leadership has finally defeated a communist insurgency (civil war really) that funded itself via extortion  kidnapping and drug sales (and perhaps some assistance from fellow travelers in Cuba  Venezuela  the USSR) for decades.  Who was destabilizing Columbia?  I think you can thank the US for helping to stabilize it.,?
9485,I never felt that Bush  McCain  or Romney behaved like the Nazis  nor did I hear that allegation.  I'm hopeful that the checks and balances in the United States will prevent the situation from developing as it did in Germany. We already saw targeting of innocent  lawful  fully vetted immigrants last weekend. I don't believe we have to wait for threats of annihilation prior to speaking out. The scapegoating   exclusion and persecution of particular nationalities and religions is the commonality between today in the US and Germany in the 1930's. I'm grateful for the non-violent legal interventions that have slowed the assault on innocents. That's why I'm active in supporting legal nonviolent avenues for change.  Hopefully  we can prevent the scapegoating from escalating as it did in Germany and your question will not apply.,?

9497,No sober second thought for this silly woman. Sometimes it is better to say nothing at all rather than open your mouth and prove to the world how truly insensitive you are.,?
9498,i ask your forgiveness - not my intent to diss pigs.    intent is to diss trump  and his describing every woman who said"no" to him as a "fat pig" .  he's getting so FFFAAAATTTT? god i love saying it - him going all porker is t the most justice i've seen in years...,?
9499,That is no longer beneficial to Khadr. How convenient  he is now a role model Canadian!,?
9500,The game is boring. Add that to millionaire players who behave like trash  thinking they are more important than their fans and employers and it's no great mystery.,?
9501,The Washington Post has repeatedly failed to inform readers about major financial conflicts of interest in pieces by opinion writer Ed Rogers. Rogers is a leading Republican lobbyist who has used his Post column to advocate for the interests of his firm’s clients without disclosure in at least a dozen instances.  Example  Wash. Post didn’t disclose that writer who penned positive piece about Trump's Saudi trip is paid by Saudi government.  Why does the Post embarrass itself by publishing lobbyist Ed Rogers?  Ed Rogers has been singing the praises of Trumpism in every instance where his clients will profit.  Ed Rogers is a grifter and a hack.  You can see why he's so unnaturally attracted to Trump.,?

9507,Re: "The size of Inaugural crowds means nothing."  Clearly (aka OBSERVABLY) it "matters" a great deal - to T-rump himself. HE is the one lying about it to try and bolster his own petulant  insatiable ego.  It seems that it is Trumplethinskin who is "so arrogant" as to NOT "believe the truth". Him and his Lugenvolksters.,?

9515,They always lie to public about their destruction of environmental habitat. This is what big oil said could not happen. Then Exxon-Valdez did happen. They said it wouldn't happen again after that. If it did  they said  they had emergency plans in place to act QUICKLY and control any leaking and could clean it immediately with all that equipment  to do icy cold water clean up. Where is cleanup ships and crews in that picture. 400 gal. should have been a breeze to clean to them!,?

9518,BC:  Interesting logic:  You think there is no point then keep asking what the point is.  I understand your need for ad hominem attacks when you get frustrated but really a tad childish  don't you think?  You are funny  stupid  but funny so as I've said before:  whatever. Now I know that you won't feel satisfied without some snappy last word rejoiner  so have at it.,?

9520,“Holy Father  document A is being interpreted as B. Please clarify whether B is the meaning of document A so we all know what it means.” is revolt?  As I read this I was reminded of the old “Just because you’re paranoid doesn’t mean people are not out to get you.”,?
9521,What a mess from the Supreme Court. I think a high school student in an eleventh grade economics course could have done better than our Supreme Court Justices did on this one.  Too late now  Supreme Court  but in future  before you wade out and start tossing policy demands upon the Legislature  here is the clause you need to add to your demands:  "The deadline for our new system  for implementation  is March 1st 2019. In the event that the Legislature has not readied a workable mechanism to implement our demands 12 months before that  their pay cut shall be 30 percent. If the Legislature has not readied a workable solution 6 months before that  their pay cut shal be 90 percent. If the Legislature has not readied a solution 90 days before that  they shall all be jailed and from in jail will be required to develop the needed solution".  That is needed. You punish the LEGISLATURE for failing  not everyday Canadians who get exposed to released rapists and murderers.,?

9525,Okay everyone lets tip toe here cause we don't want to get caught... security is tight arount the PMO. Okay lets listen is shall we?  Butts: God did I get an earful from my counterpart in the interim Trump administration! Trudeau: Yah Trump mentioned something about pony up on defense spending or if Putin takes the north so be it. Telford: You two idiots. Justin order a bunch of new jets quick!!!!!,?
9526,You don't have any research that looked for harm from fluoridated formula but didn't find any  yet you claim the amount of fluoride in breast milk is irrelevant?  How could you possibly know that if there is no research that has looked?  Are you claiming the virtual absence of fluoride in breast milk is a deficiency?  If not what is the purpose of mentioning it in the same breath as some nutrients that some breast milk is deficient in?    How can someone be deficient in something that is not essential?   If you believe breast milk is deficient in fluoride  can you tell us if any of the nutrients you mention are found at 1/150th the optimal level?  Science has not shown that mildly fluorosed teeth are more resistant to decay.   That is something you made up after reading too much Kumar.  I think the speculation that formula fed infants may be experiencing harm from fluoride is very plausible.  Otherwise  why is the NIH funding Christine Till to look for a connection?,?
9527,A very sorry looking bunch of incompetents.,?
9528,The office of the public protector has always been headed by an ANC cadre who steers clear of anything that might embarrass the ANC or government - Selby Baqwa  Lawrence Mushwana and now Busisiwe Mkhwebane.  Thuli Madonsella was an abberation - as an ANC member  Zuma thought he was appointing another Mushwana. He later found out that Ms Madonsela is a person of integrity  decency and honesty  with a passion for human rights  who was fearless in exposing maladministration and corruption wherever it was found (the hight profile political cases are actually in the monority - most of the reports deal with unscrupulous service providers like net 1 who abuse the gogos.).  Time for Amabunghe and others to lift up a few of the rocks around Ms Mkhwebane and see what slithers out.,?

Hope he is not referring to Louis Riel with that name as he was another person who MSM (of the time) portrayed unfairly to low effort types like this Riel Canadian.

9535,The do!,?
9536,This coward should have just used one bullet on himself and gotten it over with.   Instead this scum targets children and babies  well he's not of a particular race or religion so Trump has given him a pass using the usual garbage of 'thoughts and prayers' and  saying this guy was mentally ill.  Mentally ill people do not murder children in cold blood   evil  loser  inbred cowards do.  Trump won't even utter a single statement calling out this cowardly piece of trash  instead he deflect to Chicago?,?

9543,We have already cut the budget to the bone. Pay attention.   It`s time to be responsible citizens and rely on traditional sources of revenue that 98% of the rest of the communities and states in this union have.    Oil industry carpetbaggers who don`t like being responsible citizens  can try to go  see if they can live tax free somewhere in the lower forty eight  and see if they get a check each year from THAT state`s resource ownership-investments.

9547,Well  silly you.  That number is so insignificant that we shouldn't worry about it.  At least that's what they would tell us.  Well that  and the fact that half were killed by other means.,?
9548,we need to ignore the usual nonsense of stupid from people like you. mexico is a 3rd world place that has nothing compared to us or the usa in environment and labour laws never mind labour costs but you think it is right for us to continue to ship our economy to them over working with the usa to protect ours here. The left is destroying Canada one stupid thought after another.,?

9560,well....there's no going back from this one  Once you have a site  everyone is obliged to provide the same level of  facilitation   but not help.,?
9561,As is frequently the case Paul  we disagree.  It is a liberal tendency to believe that you can read the minds of others and know what they think better than they do.  For example  you know what Trump thinks right?  You have said you do.  Stupid me  I have to ask people what they think.,?
9562,Could NOT have said it better myself...Durkan is not a "politician" for goodness sake she went after SPD for their nasty behavior and IMHO it has helped...now about those free "safe" injection sites...in Ballard.

9564,Fanaticism! Religious devotion/insanity! Muslimaniacs have been butchering people for centuries before there was a USA.

9570,the hypocracy of the LGBT... advocates at womens shelters and related organizations who refuse to accept trannies born as males. apparantly only the trannies born as females get their (our)  financial and emotional support,?
9571,Trump is a pathological liar who routinely lies about things big and small  regardless of reality because he knows his dim-witted followers will believe everything he says.   My opinion that Trump supporters are not just uninformed  but are actually stupid is based upon the following: When one is ignorant  that can be remedied by seeking out knowledge and retaining it. When one is stupid  one is not only proud of one's ignorance but actively refuses to become informed and scorns fact-based education.,?
9572,The Muslims generally welcome Jews by either slitting their throats or hanging them in the town square. Other than that  they have falafel in common.,?

9582,Work Farce: good point. But the Globe data reported a few years ago came during the Sephen Harper years. Now that Justin Trudeau is in power   it's time to run defence for Stephen Bronfman and other wealthy power-hitters in Ottawa.  This is the Globe's role these days.,?

9586,"...Her foreign minister  a political rival  upped the rhetoric Monday by declaring that with Trump’s policies  “the West has become smaller.”..."  Actually  it's more like NATO has been right-sized.  America should be about world peace and not simply supporting the desires of NATO.,?
9587,Has Paul Ryan ever been quoted as reprimanding his colleagues for attacking Trump? I have lived with Ryan in WI for a long time and I will now support anyone who opposes him. He is the perfect example of the DC puppets who say soothing media crap whenever a liberal pulls the string from his back. I'm fed up with Paul Cantor Ryan and McConnell and McCain and Collins and Graham and Flake and Sasse. I hope we find a way to send these Trump-haters home. These guys are the perfect reason for supporting term limits.,?

9589,You're clearly a cop Mountain  tell us how you really feel. You can't believe the stupid crap you post here.,?
9590,Democrats are putting together a 'message' for the voters about what they stand for.  If McConnell and Trump get their way and repeal ACA without replacement  voters will see Democrats' platform clearly for themselves: Democrats stand for providing health care and other safety nets for poor and middle class.  Republicans don't.  In politics  2018 is day after tomorrow.,?
9591,wow you live in a delusional world bud  there are NO OIL SUBSIDIES!  man why are you left wingers so stupid. that myth was proven false long ago as the left wing idiots who came up with it were claiming oil was just not taxed enough as they think it should thus such were subsidies when clearly that thinking is a fantasy   LIKE YOURS,?
9592,Say what? Failure of the Gay UN troops????? How do we know their sexual orientation?,?
9593,Sounds like you are the stupid one full of insults.,?
9594,wiliki is  naturally  correct.  Even Trump  as slow intellectually is  does not want widespread bloodshed over this phony issue.  There is no reason to move the embassy.  Tillerson that trump should not if it endangers any peace process.  Israelis will fight any peace but many are wary of riling up Muslims throughout the Mid East.  Why risk massive bloodshed on both sides for no reason but the bump Trump fulfillign an irresponsible and ignorant "promise.",?

Put all our resources behind Ward and get her elected and  hopefully  McCain will soon be gone - that LIAR TRAITOR McCain is a disgrace to the people of Arizona - HE BROKE HIS WORD about REPEAL and is the most arrogant self-righteous Quisling who works AGAINST the WILL of the Voters - damn you  McCain - you pathetic little brat - Love Arpaio but he has a chance to make a difference in some other capacity - Arizona just wants to get rid of both RINO TRAITOR senators - MAGA!,?
9598,JHC  RMC  I can't dumb this down any more than I already have!  I already responded to your question in the excerpts from other sources I already posted--which I not only provided links to  but also spoon-fed to you in bite-sized chunks. Yet you still complain that everything I've already posted is just a lot of "werds" to you.    Then I tried to over-simplify it even more by asking you to simply copy and paste the werds--from the single source you posted--that you think are "facts."  Yet you continue to insist that I tell you what you perceive as "facts"--as if I am supposed to read your mind.  You can write  so I assumed you can read.  But now I wonder if you even read the op-ed piece YOU posted.  Assuming you have  what is the problem?  After all  I've had other students who needed remedial edu  but they did not deny they needed it like you do.  So  unlike Trump  who admitted health care is more complicated than he thought  are you just too proud to admit that?  No shame  brah!,?
9599,BC voters are so easy to fool  look how Clark and her lying Liberals have hoodwinking BC for so long pretending they are some kind of low tax  no deficit government.  What BS  compare BC to Alberta  and what do you see  how about a PST  a real estate tax on every property bought in BC  huge ferry fees  bridge tolls  a stupid two tiered electricity system that rips people and business's off   medical premiums  probably the last province that still has them  provincial parks that are pathetic and run down   Alberta has none of these  not one even with the NDP as government.  Clark and her Liberals are a BS phoney low tax government  they take all that extra money from the people and pretend they are for low taxes.  All these user fees and other taxes are nothing more than high taxes driving the people of BC into Liberal crazy land.  It's time to get out of Liberal crazy land and vote NDP  if only to send the lying Liberals packing.,?
9600,This is such an interesting idea!,?

9607,Trudeau is unprincipled and is merely following the money.

9611,This is far from a new phenomenon   Survivalists and anti-government groups have existed for decades.  With instant media exposure via the internet we're far more aware of them....but they're not new.  In my opinion  they're nihilists (definition:  of or believing in nihilism  or the total rejection of established laws and institutions) and see government and laws as intrusions on their personal freedom.    Traditionally  they have lived in rather isolated enclaves and had little interaction with the "main stream."  They interact with the BLM  Forest Service and Parks and Wildareas Departments since those agencies control areas they seek to use  or  in my opinion  abuse.  They will ignore laws  regulations and policies as long as they can "get away" with it.....Their classic passive/aggresssive tactics turn to threats of violence when confronted.They're scofflaws and have been successful scofflaws for far too long.,?
9612,Does Trudeau recognise Taiwan's independence?,?
9613,The dumbest and most atrocious law ever to benefit lawbreakers is : Children born here ( by woman that sneaked into the US under cover of darkness to defraud us) are automatically granted US citizenship. That law screams for cancellation! These parents stay here because the dumbgooddoers say you can not separate families.,?
9614,Considering how leaky this investigation has been  if they had found something significant  I think we would have heard about it.  I am willing to wait and see what. if anything  comes out of this.  My guess is that if there is one person connected to Trump who should be worried it is Manafort.  He has pretty close connections to the Russian mafia.  And while I say that one needs to realize that the Russian mafia has extensive ties to the government.  Anyone who does significant business with the PUtin government will have some interaction with the Russian mafia.  Case in point  PUtin came from a poor family and his wealth now is estimated to be 60 billion dollars.  He certainly did make that money on a government salary.  And while I do believe their is significant corruption in our government  it pales in comparison to what is happening in Russia.,?
9615,I do not like the way Canada votes so I am not going to take place. I play by MY rules not some stupid ones somebody else made up.,?

9619,Got a chance to visit Round Island in the 90's while working on a fishing vessel in Bristol Bay for the summer. One of the coolest places I've ever visited if you discount the overpowering smell of the guano of thousands upon thousands of seabirds nesting in the cliffs. Maybe one of the reasons I fell in love with the State and never left. The place is a treasure.,?
9620,Truly a cautionary tale.  No doubt the program has value  but yes these are the days of "evidence based" everything.  If you're going to make a claim  it's now up to you to do your homework to empirically support that claim to give it validity (it's also a lot easier to get the desired results if YOU gather the data as opposed to an arms-length third party).  It's the new game out there  and apparently the NYHDP didn't understand the rules.,?
9621,Looked at in the most positive light  anything Republicans propose can at most  be of only accidental  incidental benefit to anyone but the rich.  Anyone who believes differently is an idiot.,?
9622,hey loser  it was cnn   the NYT    washington post  MSNBC  all shilling and working with hillarys team  try again ignorant one,?
9623,Gregor is a real cuck's cuck.,?
9624,LOL  so are we supposed to have hope now that sanity and integrity will prevail with the NRA lap dogs in Congress? Let me see if I get this right: 1. The slaughter continues  but American white guys (like me)   now supplant Muslims as the Number One Suspect for domestic terrorism  2. Everything else about our insane obsession with guns continues  but silencers are not cool now.  Is that the best the American Right can do? Give me a freaking break! I see  media instilled paranoia drive our obsession - there will probably be a run on assault rifles now because  OMG  they will be outlawed. There is no precedent for this insanity. Wake me up when compassionate humans with a conscience prevail!,?
9625,Come on man  most of them have never been to the Wicked Walu. Trip Advisor rates the place as 5 star. $$$$ is no problem  Carbon Barbie is fully funded.,?
9626,That is because they don't actually report news or use their brains anymore.  Not required for their agenda.,?
9627,Ummm. Maybe you should have observed your own words before you submitted lies about me to the council. You're a hypocrite  we know that much. -- Paul,?
9628,Maybe he's just sick and tired of the disgusting mess we call "politics.",?
9629,It is not beyond comprehension for a politician to support neo-Nazis if the politician is promoting fascism. Trump made clear in his campaign that he was a racist and a fascist. As long as Americans tolerate a fascist occupying their highest office  their country is deservedly cursed. Like the Nazis lead by Hitler  the neo-Nazi Trump will bring dishonor and humiliation upon the American people.,?
9630,I agree it is a grievous thing to seduce a 22 year old woman when you are a 50 year old married president. As you point out  it's an abuse of position even if it is consensual and legal.  As for cheating on Hillary  that's a private matter and the fact that it became a matter of state at the time is an indication of the stupidity of Republicans and by extension  Americans.  Bill is a sleaze bag. Trump is more like Jerry Sandusky. He should not be around female children of any age.,?
9631,Or he could put on his big boy pants and tell these guys to piss off and go back to whatever country they came from. At the end of the day they’re spending our hard earned taxpayer dollars. If we taxpayers stood up and raised our voices the courts and Trudeau would bow down like the scum they are. Don’t defend Trudeau like he’s on the taxpayer side. He isn’t.,?
9632,Wow  that might be the dumbest thing i have ever read on here and that is really saying something!,?
9633,I would also ban any polling within 90 days of any election.  While  HRC did run a poor campaign  the polls consistently showed her ahead.  The weak (unlikely to vote) voter saw that she was leading and thus saw no reason to o to the voting booth.  After all  the polls showed that she was going to win so why should I take time away from Kardasian news to vote.,?
9634,What's even more tacky and cruel is to pretend the citizens are stupid and don't know what's going on ...,?
9635,It is beyond the capacity of the UK government to simultaneously hold Brexit negotiations and Scottish independence negotiations.  And the only grounds for a second Scottish referendum would be if Brexit goes ahead - which is not a certainty.  May should insist that the timetable be that the UK negotiate and move forward with Brexit.  And only then would Scotland be allowed to hold a second referendum.,?
9636,A region of the world where everyone is the enemy of everyone else. Both Iranians and the Saudis promote the most backward and intolerant forms of Islam that are the basis of terrorist ideologies around the world. A pit full of vipers.,?
9637,When you have the facts on your side  you argue the facts.  When you have the law on your side  you argue the law.  When you have neither facts nor law on your side  you argue.  The modern Right are in the same state the Church was centuries ago when Science demonstrated that the Church's assumption of Reality was provable error. For today's Right isn't about a general collective of principles but rather ideology - turning political preferences into religion itself -- and then worshiping the result.  Conservatism (properly understood) is an approach of caution and doubt as to the inevitably more radical assertions of the Left. Conservatism does not say "We should never change" but rather "I doubt your promises will turn out as rosy as you insist and change will also mean discarding much of value from the past; so  let's go slowly." (Distinct from today's Right which insists on "principles" as God-given "Truth".  Conservatives honor Knowledge. Today's Right is at war with Knowledge.,?
9638,You're being ignorant. He was sharing his PAST experience to voice his frustration with a "news" outlet and how they handled a PAST situation  very much like they are handling this current situation. He was trying to let people know that this is something he (and others) find to be a consistent problem. The "news" outlet just has to play it safe so THEY don't get sued. They don't have concern for other's potential problems  unless they can right a story about it  safely  from the comfort of their office  without getting sued or looking stupid. I get it  but I don't agree with it. It's just a job  right ADN? What's the worst that could happen if you don't share relevant and accurate information about a known criminal that is actively evading arrest?! I mean  it's not like this is a news outlet...oh wait....,?
9639,and none of them have a carbon tax you ignorant idiot,?
9640,What a horrible  oily  useless little man.  I'm getting completely fatigued reading the web.  Whenever I think  they can't possibly get out of this one  they wriggle their way out.  Now whenever I see anyone in ANC regalia I think to myself 'there goes someone with a single digit IQ'.,?
9641,The structure in the photo doesn't look like a duplex to me. The owner probably converted it into a duplex  perhaps illegally  to be able to make more money by housing more people  which degrades the neighborhood. Rental properties should be outlawed in many neighborhoods.,?
9642,Right. Dead from the neck up. How stupid do these fools think we are? As stupid as they are ?   Yeah right. Like being that stupid is easy. We have to get this ship of bought and paid for fools out of office as quickly as we can  as they are destroying our country with their ideological schemes that are proven disasters.  We need a massive petition from all across Canada requesting that they immediately resign and call new elections,?
9643,Don't fret! He was pegged as the perp.,?
9644,WATCH OUT!  Whiny white guy is afraid of a young Samoan girl!  Will he now go out and shoot a brown person to restore his damaged illusion of 'manhood'???  Five'll getcha ten if he went at her unarmed she'd kick his @$$...,?
9645,Take him back to Germany and hang him up nude for public display and desecration. Then grind him up and feed him to the pigs.,?
9646,I read all the comments  but for me--I am more than happy to see the President--but I have a motive.  I want to see Melania in a bikini!!!!!,?
9647,You eat cows  pigs  horses  caribou  and chickens  so what are you whining about?,?
9648,What will it take for some of the commentators to understand that there is a hateful muslim subculture in most of the European countries by now. They deal with a very different muslim immigration than we do in Canada and  many of the muslims live lives totally centred around the islamist style mosques in the cities of Europe.  They feel disenfranchised and outside society.  Not necessarily because of racism  but just as well because they believe in jihad. So how can we say that they are even English when nothing they do or say or believe in has anything to do with English values as we know them.  As we even know English values as Canadians.  As we are part of the Commonwealth  this also touches us.  And we should care when people who have been welcomed into a country flaunt their hatred like these terrorists do.   Who has the answer to deal with this problem?  No one today.  It's easy to become a racist when one is confronted with this all the time.  We know nothing of this in Canada.,?
9649,And communism and socialism work so well? Someone has to pay  you don't sound drunk either but you aren't thinking. But I do agree we need to take care of our citizens first!  "Socialism is a philosophy of failure  the creed of ignorance  and the gospel of envy  its inherent virtue is the equal sharing of misery." Winston Churchill  "The left is back  and it's the only path we have to get out of the spot to which the right has sunken us. Socialism builds and capitalism destroys." Hugo Chavez  Socialism is about claims of justice  and it is also about money: about wealth  income  physical and financial capital. It is an ideology based on allocating economic resources. It may try to achieve that goal by nationalizing assets  by command-and-control regulation  or by taxation and redistribution.,?
9650,"Canada walks the talk on global women’s rights" Ha!  You do realized Trudeau is giving away money  worldwide  like a drunken sailor  everywhere he goes  with borrowed money  billions of it  all to fund  among others  dubious feminist causes  like easy abortion on demand  all free of charge. Easy to walk the talk with some one else's borrowed money. Pathetic.,?
9651,Yes  exactly correct.  However  that gun you buy on line will be shipped to a gun store and you will be required to pass a federal (and maybe state) background check as well as the gun will be verified to be legal in the location of your residence.,?
9652,Fear mongering ... hmm ... let's see  from King Trump and the Republicans:   Obama is letting the UN invade us - I can see the blue helmets from here!; Obama is a socialist; Obama is going to take away our guns; Hillary runs a pedophile ring; the democrats are letting millions of people vote illegally (perhaps one of the biggest lies ever pushed on the American people); Obamacare is bad (even though more Americans now have health care than at any other time in our history) .. the list goes on  and on  and on. But you're buying into the nonsense  so of course it's okay for you to do it!    And suppose there were 25 people marching to protest Obama's UN invasion  or the myth that he was taking away people's guns? Would you apply the same filter - that they're wasting time marching about a lie  that there's only 25 of them  etc. No  you'd proclaim them patriots  even though what they are marching about is total nonsense.,?
9653,Me thinks Rudy was being sarcastic  as for the AG / Obama Administration this is finding a problem where essentially none exists  the world ain't perfect.  Were they to share the same zealousness in enforcing Federal Law on sanctuary cities or the border catch and release stupidity then there might be some credibility.,?
9654,And guess who pays? Oh no  the taxpayer. When do these politicians they are supposed to be elected for the good of the people  not to play stupid politician's games.,?
9655,It is much safer to use pidgin with those you know and are very familiar with; i.e.  their background and comfort with using pidgin in varying situations.    Appropriate use of pidgin means using it in context...not just knowing the lingo.  For example  a local looking person  born and raised here but spent a number of years on the mainland  well educated  in a work situation would not expect their first introduction to a new person be in pidgin.  Interestingly the meta communication as a witness to this situation ( and many others like it):  "No tink you stay bettah den us.  You like us.  And no foget."  It was a way of exercising power over someone who is seen as a threat.  All of us are an amalgamation of influences and experiences that connect our thoughts and actions.  All we can do is self-observe so we know "how fo act".  Thank you  Caleb.,?
9656,Huge amount of money to subsidize idiots who live in flood ways  but the ruling party really does not care about deficits or debt.,?
9657,Suuure  buy your personal hygiene products at a Dollar Store! Seriously? Do you not know where that stuff comes from? For a dollar or two? Fake toothpaste  contaminated ear plugs  and so on..... Great advice. What's wrong with Globe and Mail posting articles like this? This one tipped the glass - not renewing my subscription next week! National Post is waaay more professional in what they publish.,?
9658,Little Bitch lefty.,?
9659,Almost 66 million voters (2.8 million more than 45) didn't take him at his word in November  my guess is that that number is growing daily. Every day he is having to walk back one or more of his lies and transparent "promises." Just to name one  he got spanked hard over his (lack of) immigration policy and the whole world saw that. It's getting interesting.,?

9668,How else can one describe ‘slimy underbelly’ situation?  That is it CI (Catholic Institution) is not a civil organization!   CI behaves worse than ‘slimy underbelly’ ways  condoning clergy sex abuses of God in children and Pope F. and the all of prelates and bishops hiding and enabling rapists clergies and they are proud about their criminal conducts beside!!! I just about vomit when I think about this sick organization!!! I cry to God about this sick organization everyday!,?
9669,You're right  whatever was I thinking? I must immediately apologize to my relatives for all the mean things I say on civil comments. Ahhhh gotcha! No but seriously  you need to put down the weed  it makes you say stupid $**t.,?
9670,OK Globe... whoever writes your "headlines" needs a lesson or two with regards to sensationalism and accuracy. As I watched the news conference  where you got the same information  Trump stated: "...May be at an all time low." Now your headline blares: Trump DECLARES!!   Maybe look up words? Declares and Suggests are two very different words. One depicts honesty  the other is flat out NOT honest... I realize the Mop and Pail isn't what it used to be  but why follow the National Inquirer road...?,?
9671,The cause was more important than missing a couple of hours of class time . To see young people actually concerned about something bigger than themselves is refreshing especially in Eugene where a lot of students obviously don't get much direction from their parents that is positive at least .  Too many people would rather tell people they are wasting their time on important things like the future of our country or the planet .  Why they think like that could be for many reasons   one of which is Trumposian . Trumplers are too blind  narrow minded and stupid to see the path that the mental case is leading us down . They think he is going to make their lives all rosey and sweet . He s far is backing off on promises he made to these racist brain farts who could make the world so much better being kicked off of it,?
9672,JAP- I also agree with what you said above about Obama's motives. I'm pretty sure Obama is on the record as stating he didn't want to bring these allegations up for fear that he'd be heavily condemned for trying to influence the election. While he knew of these allegations at the time I've got to hand it to him - that was a very difficult decision to make and  I could add  one that may well have been sufficient to throw the election for Hillary. He knew that even the appearance of helping Hillary would not go over well so he stood down. As much as I despise Trump  I admire Obama for taking the high road...(Trump certainly wouldn't have  that's for sure.),?
9673,Boyle's story stinks to high heaven.  The guy is either willfully deceitful or jaw dropping stupid. Only a complete village idiot would take his wife pregnant in her third trimester to a country with Third World health care. Apparently he wanted to embed himself into the Taliban as a wartime free lance journalist - another Edward Murrow of WW2 fame.  The fact that he was married to Omar Khadr's sister should be enough to assume he converted to Islam which is why he was kept alive for five years and no financial ransom was asked .  I feel sorry for his kids - unless their American grandparents intervene they will suffer a miserable life at the hands of two of the stupidest parents in Canada.  I would not believe a single word that comes out of this guy's mouth.,?
9674,People are morons  this is the media attempting  along with whom I said above  to discredit Trump  this is VERY predictable.,?
9675,^^ Russian troll detected,?

9677,I didn't mean to "like" my own comment  (darn computers).,?
9678,I have a better idea. Let's disband the council. Seeing as we let developers disregard the law constantly  we could save money by not having the idiots who make said laws on the payroll.,?

9684,Maybe UC Davis provides a better academic environment for their latest recruit. They also continue to be on the rise as far as competing at this level athletically.

9697,North America (canada and USA)have no business telling any country about human rights due to atrocities to native nations in the past - past american presidents are just as bad as hit---er was....china would not murder innocent people including children so canada and especially the US should shut the fuck up about human rights,?
9698,“Ultimately  the success of the evacuation during the wildfire was largely due to the young demographics of the community  and how the community rallied together ”  I don't live in Fort Mac but I did work there in 1974-75 and am familiar with the topography  the vegetation and Hwy 63.  This morning I took the time & trouble to locate and examine the report (90+ pages). What struck me was several things: - no consideration of the availability of motor fuel. The success of the evacuation was indeed due to the remarkable cooperation among the residents and their youthful demographics.  It was also largely due to the availability of gasoline. There were reports at the time of gas stations that ran out of fuel  motorists siphoning & sharing fuel  etc.  In communities like the Fort (one way in  one way out) it is vital that the community have enough fuel on hand to supply a sudden surge in demand. [TBC]  The report is here: https://www.alberta.ca/assets/documents/Wildfire-MNP-Report.pdf,?
9699,The only thing Trump is going to win is a place in the Guinnes Book of Records as the biggest lying and most inept POTUS in US history.

9700,In 2015 there were 43 million people in U.S. living in poverty.  (Poverty defined by U.S. Census Bureau Poverty Thresholds in 2015 as household income of less than $$ 24 247 for a family of four.) According to the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction the U.S. has spent $104 billion on reconstruction and infrastructure projects in Afghanistan. Congress seems okay with a good chunk of its citizenry surviving on food stamps while it pursues extravagant imperial adventures. Eisenhower was right: beware the military industrial complex. No president has been able to  bell this monstrous cat:   from Reagan to Clinton  the Bushes  and Obama  military priorities come first. So  we shouldn't really have expected much more from Drumpf that his default response on major policy decisions: "Gee  who would have thought Afghanistan was this complicated?",?
9701,whiny parents make me vomit in my mouth . Get a life   and let your kids grow up with out you in their hair .

9702,No one is actually saying lets be nice to them and they will never commit another crime again.  Every person on this thread has committed a crime at some point in time and not gotten caught  lets be honest  speeding is a crime.  No one is saying we need to bring them into our own homes  so far everyone agrees that they should be in prison.  HOWEVER  there is years of empirical evidence proving that education  rehabilitation  basic human decency greatly reduces recidivism.,?
9703,And thank you for the work that you do at Maria House. What pains me  though  is that there are not nearly enough programs to support people like Jen and her children and not nearly enough programs to help people who get out of prison ... The fact that we have permitted the social net to become so frayed that we have homeless children in every corner of our country is beyond awful.,?
9704,What an idiot! And not sure what to call the people who watch her 'news show!!,?
9705,"Doug Lamborn bought stock that was later linked to a colleague’s insider trading inquiry"  No big deal.  After all  Lamborn is a Republican.,?
9706,If you actually read the poll question  it states that "the majority of Canadians say the government made the wrong decision in SETTLING the lawsuit" and "should have fought the case". They're not necessarily against the settlement but rather thought that it should have gone to the SCC to be settled. There are lies  damn lies  statistics and worst of all polls. It seems you have to actually read the question to understand the poll.,?

9709,But we do have a glut - the reserves will be recovered at the higher price levels that initiated their discovery and development. Fossil fuels ( Petroleum & Nat Gas ) will be more than competitive with "Green Energy" ( wind & solar ) far into the future at any price level - particularly the transport sector.  And global warming is real - but nothing that Canada can influence or mitigate to any significant extent due to our insignificant population and huge land mass.,?
9710,No  Chugiak. Until you can prove that you have magically developed ESP  you only look stupid when you keep bleating that you know that 'every' man lacks the ability to practice integrity and respect. It's really just the overgrown adolescents you surround yourself with. When (and if) you ever mature out of adolescence  you may gain the capacity to understand why many other men  with wives they love  mothers they admire  and daughters they would die for  are sickened by this rich entitled sexist asshat.,?
9711,What  this was censored? Why?? I was able to give a rational reply  that is much more useful than just suppressing the comment!,?
9712,Democrats passed the ACA with this provision but then failed to pass a budget where the funds to pay for it were included.  Only Congress has at the authority to obligate funds and not the President.  The payments should never have had been made and the Insurance companies should be required to repay the US Treasury every last penny paid subsidies.  Further an full scale THOROUGH investigation should be done as to why US health care and Pharma cost are so much higher that other countries but just like in education the return is significantly less.  It costs the USA $116 BILLION dollars each year to support the illegal aliens in the community so perhaps is the country concentrated in removing any and all illegal aliens the money for healthcare would be more easily available.  Democrats want their cake and eat it also.,?
9713,Actually  the reason for all of the POTUS hate is that Trump is worthy of hate.  He's a pathological liar and a fraud.  Trump is completely and pridefully ignorant of what it takes to be President.  Trump isn't failing because of the media.  He's failing because he's an incredibly lousy President.,?
9714,Yeah  I noticed that too when it was too late to edit.  I meant to say most powerful leader.  Thanks for pointing out my error  anyhow.,?
9715,hey loser  the us under obama CHANGED the rules counting those turned back at the border as those deported and leaving  take those away and its the lowest number in decades... so as usual lefty loser  try again,?

9717,He had full auto what sounded like an AR 223 5.56. I doubt he paid the 200 dollar tax stamp and 65k for a legal one. He is thought to be a Muslim convert so lets ban Muslims. fuck the left.,?

You paid me another $2 million and I will turn ISIS into Salvation army... everything in that country is for sale...Bin Laden was funded and created by that community. All drug addictics in US were created by that community to fund wars in South America...the list is going on and on,?

9722,Once again an adviser makes misleading recommendations about the home buyer's plan. As if being forced to pay the money back is not a tax implication.  " the federal Home Buyers’ Plan will allow her a one-time withdrawal of up to $25 000 from her RRSP – with no tax implications – that she can use toward the purchase of a house. The withdrawal must be paid back over 15 years starting two years after the home is bought to avoid any penalties.",?

9728,Yes but those "mobs" only formed after years of trying to get the crown to address the colonies grievances.  The leaders of the War for American Independence tried to use the system to correct itself (due process) before revolting against the crown.  An interesting concept I learned about our "revolution" was that it wasn't a revolution to go forward with change but and attempt to return (revolve backwards) to our freedoms prior to those events you mention.,?
9729,Selling public assets is short-sighted policy because the assets CD Howe wants sold  like airports  have no competition and so the public will end up being gouged.  The public will end up paying far more for reduced service and reduced quality of service  as corporations try to milk every nickel of profit out of the organization. Employees will probably be laid off and re-hired at less than half their previous wages/salary  with the difference pocketed by the owners.  Typical C.D. Howe (or should I say "seedy Howe"),?

In the meantime  I hope you will stop pestering them on the phone. It helps no one.,?
9733,Meanwhile  the discussion in the Senate on Health Care  the overhaul of the budget  and the many administrative cut-backs now going on will determine if anyone is listening. To be satisfied that nothing major was cut for 2017 is a minimalist response. That so many proposed cuts seem both vindictive and ill-advised  it is clear the Trump agenda is still threatening more people  mostly to be suffered by the poor and most vulnerable while the self-satisfied rich enjoy preferential treatment.,?
9734,Don't be a dick,?
9735,How big a fool does he takes us for?  He's above everyone else,?
9736,No  this was directed exclusively at Trump. I have a small penis but not offended by comments about them. I grew up.,?
9737,The original kneeler was kneeling to the national anthem.,?
9738,you clearly are a sick delusional public sector paid idiot,?
9739,Yes but the error should be undone not expanded.,?
9740,Monster loss  and all Elway can accomplish  is to sit in his booth eating sunflower seeds   and spit them in to a cup. Pathetic  some one should lose their job of this embarrassment.,?
9741,Of course the comment you refer to is more funny than anything else  but basically it is some sort of underhand advertising.  I think it is meant to illustrate that this comment section does not want to provide a forum for advertising especially not to witchdoctors and penis enlargers. I fully agree with that.,?
9742,Yet here you are  not only having read the article  but posting an asinine comment on it!  SMH,?
9743,Anchorage Muni elections will be vote by mail for the next one.  There will be locations to vote by old school ballots as well but not a lot.,?
9744,Right You Are Temp! Knowing now China does'nt have NK's back  hopefully Kim Jong Un will come to his senses. Really ? I don't think he has any senses he's just a young brat  a child who knows nothing about world diplomacy and compromise . Ultimately  if Push comes to shove  he will send his people off.........to their death.IMUA!,?
9745,I highly recommend the new "mute" feature. It works like a charm.,?
9746,How was this guy ever assessed as a desirible immigrant to America?  What kind of thinking brought him in?  Morrissey was so right when he said the elites make stupid policies and regular people pay the cost.,?
9747,Child welfare investigated every claim and did not find on any of them. The term child is used several times yet many of the inmates are 18 and over all the way up to 21. Many of the inmates are there long term for very serious crimes to include murder. Why do none of you care about those facts? Many of these inmates are concealing dangerous weapons meant to attack the officers. These inmates cannot be placed in seclusion and the officers have no preventive tools to use other then physically restraining them when they commit vicious assaults. Learn a little more facts before you right an article Jennifer Brown. Your reporting is garbage.,?
9748,Tridentine ideology is unexciting to me.,?
9749,I thought were done via bills?,?
9750,What's it like being an imbecile?,?
9751,He just blasted to the criminal community he doesn't own a gun. I guess he's trusting  Chuck Norris or stupid. My money is on the latter,?
9752,Sorry typos  a healthy work force and Asset.,?
9753,The "truce" is a ruse  so the communist rebels can be arrested  and tried in court.,?
9754,In six words:  Donald Trump is a pathological liar.,?
9755,The elephant in the room here is that the journalists are the ones that have changed the relationship!!! The way they intentionally slant their story lines and report unverified information.But worst of all they attack Trump personally and disrespect the Office because they don't like and/or disagree ideologically with him.They are behaving like children having a tantrum and the majority of American see it  that's why Trump is not losing support.He is right   they must change how the report the news and learn how to show respect while still disagreeing with someone.,?
9756,So you're sleeping better now that the President is escalating tensions with his bombastic remarks?  Do you want war with N. Korea?  I think the President is acting a fool and he'd better watch his mouth before he gets a whole lot of people killed.  This is lunacy.,?
9757,News of "Pussy" Trump's sensibility being threatened by a Colbert joke could only go viral.,?
9758,Recall Walker,?
9759,Now lets get Hilary and Obama!!!!,?
9760,I truly believe Don Young is stupid enough to believe what he's saying.   If Sullivan and Murkowski are really as ignorant as their statements indicate  they don't belong in office. If they're only taking those positions for cynical political reasons  then...they don't belong in office.,?
9761,In a place that's always been.,?
9762,while lunatics of the nut left like you live in the daily delusions  trump carries on improving america  fixing the obama mess and will easily win re-election in a landslide with every job his policies are creating  buy you keep crying loser,?
9763,hey Rochdale  - you pathetic troll - why not waste your rubles on a white supremacist publication  rather than spew your vitriol here.,?
9764,Trump is a mentally unbalanced weak and belligerent child.  He's a wanna-be fascist and a white supremacist buffoon.  He's conned all his supporters and his scam is falling apart all around his shoulders and their shoulders.,?
9765,Just the dumbest politician on the Island.  Too bad he's got such an important job.,?
9766,Who's writing these headlines?  Steve Bannon?  Any reference to this travesty should include the FACT that the dictator did not provide one iota of evidence to support this preposterous claim.  To do otherwise implies that Trump is fighting for the truth  not protecting his lies.,?
9767,Really CNN  just....REALLY????  What the heck is wrong with you people??  The only ones crazy  and unhinged is CNN  NYP  WAPO  ETC!!!!!!!!!  CNN. Divide and conquer for communism  and the left.,?
9768,Because Canadians are sheep who have been conditioned for half a century  by leftist elites using the the USA as a whipping-boy surrogate for evil garbage  to obsessively think it is awesome when Canada does better than being evil garbage.  Yay  we are better than garbage!  Yay!  That is the mindset of Canada for half a century  a mindset that is the product of leftist elites - many of whom arrived here from the USA as draft dodgers and such.,?
9769,Since when does doing historic research and publishing a book  make one a traitor?   I suggest you read Fahrenheit 451 by Kurt Vonnegut.  At least read the Wiki.  Please.  Everyone.,?
9770,The new definition of dumb.,?
9771,A good move and I hope the Russians pay a high price for their support of Assad and blind eye to ISIS. Sorry Putin you screwed up again--as expected- and your trolls are a joke.,?
9772,ignorant and stupid  i work in the bc north and they are dangerous  able and ready to run you down in a heart beat   man you city folks are so ignorant of reality,?
9773,Bill Clinton also: rapes women  penetrates women with cigars in the Oval office  hangs out with child rapists on their rapist islands  blatantly lies to the American people and perjurs himself before congress.   But ya' know  Trump followed the tax law and said some rude things about Rosey O'Donnel  so I guess that's worse?,?
9774,For nineteen years since suffering a perforated right ear drum I've continued going to Mass with increasing difficulty due mostly to the ever too loud music and singing which annoys me considerably. And yet  on one occasion I attended a Mass where instead of liturgical music of any kind  there were hymns sung à capella style with amazing synchronization and clarity. It was reminiscent of an Antrim Choir CD of favorite Mennonite hymns which I enjoy listening to as I drive.,?
9775,Does anyone remember the Tawana Brawley case?  Slow down on quick rushes to judgement. False accusations have happened before.,?
9776,Now you are reaching  just to comment. I read stupid comments before and yours are at the top. Crazy  just stupid crazy.,?
9777,and the idiots that worship that media.,?
9778,Repeal it don't replace it or replace it to what we has before.Before=2500.00 deductible NOW $6850.00 and 100.00 office visits.America got FUCKED,?
9779,You just couldn't enjoy the fun could you......lol.  Always stalking the site w/your panties (or briefs) in a twisted bunch...causing irritation and then being nasty w/us who know how to have fun.    Geez.  Okay.  So you uptight repugs should go get drunk?  I saw you last night man.  WHOA!  YOU know how to parthay!  How ya feel this am dude?  BuWHAAAA HA HA,?
9780,stupid nitwit  trying to make hay out of nothing  we all knew what we were signing up for...so IF he said it  so what ...and IF he said it  the tone of voice and the intent is what counts...it can be very respectful  and I know that trump totally respects the military...,?
9781,What does "proper gun control legislation" look like?,?
9782,As a well to do white male  I'm probably one of the only people here who will do just fine under a Trump presidency.  Hell  my taxes might even go down.  But he would be a complete disaster for our country and dangerous for many people I care about  so yes  I will stoke fear  which is very real  about the prospect of him becoming President.  I much preferred Bernie  but I think some nebulous need to feel good about voting on "principal" pales in comparison to the broader and more immediate need to vote on outcome.  I think to do otherwise just because Bernie failed to take over the party of which he was not even a part in a single election cycle is myopic  selfish  whiny  indulgent  and many other adjectives as well.  I understand being upset.  I don't understand being stupid.,?
9783,What about if you are on salary? In the trades you don't work  you don't get paid. Real world stuff.,?
9784,I believe you need to educate yourself before you just end up looking ignorant. Mr.Finicum was a Constitutionalist who supported individual freedom  and was not Ammons "bodyguard"  he was his friend. If you consider a man who personally took in 50 different foster children  and taught them self respect  and discipline using love and kindness  an extremist  you are an idiot.,?
9785,216john. Leaked transcript: Trump caved pathetically on the phone to the Mexican prez about the wall  admitted it was just political talk and manipulation. He's failing in so many other ways. And you're lining up behind casino pageant groper telling us he's a talent? No one underestimates Trump's ability to trick  lie  dupe  cover-up  avoid paying taxes  hoard wealth  cozy up to fundamentalists and racists  alienate key allies  reduce complex issues to junior high locker room levels  ignore science  lose his temper  and speak in erratic  senseless sentences.  And no one underestimates some Americans' inclination to fall for this guy.,?
9786,You don't understand. I'm not saying DQ her as a current democrat. I'm saying they will DQ her from the ballot as she currently does not belong to the party  and cannot join in time to meet the party rules as stupid as they might be.,?
9787,This is news?  Yawn,?
9788,We should do both. Sons don't be raging rapists and daughters don't be raging sluts.,?
9789,No "presumption of innocence" on this board.,?
9790,Who cares about the Boy Scouts..??  or Mexico..??  or John Barron.??  or John Miller..?? This guy  Trump  is a weirdo freak...and it's like he doesn't even care...,?
9791,Funny how she says that Clinton's problems were "private" "none of our business". I guess she is referring to Monica but that was never what the charges against Clinton were about they were about harassment of Paula Jones  an employee  and about the rape of a woman named Juanita Brodrick who ran a group of nursing homes and wanted help from the then governor  it was about Kathleen Wiley who was assaulted when she asked for help after her husband died. And let me be clear these were all democrat women you turned your back on. So your little column is more of the same hypocrisy as all the other disgusting garbage that has filled the Hollywood cesspool for all these yrs. Your column is just more of the same self serving pathetic pap that the rest are shoveling.,?
9792,The report doesn't suggest that the residents agree to keep the peace.... to the contrary!  Who's idea was the misleading heading?,?
9793,Yes you liar you go to jail for telling lie.,?
9794,To re-word what I'm saying is that in the perception of the public  both sides are trying to avoid culpability in the future tapping of the PF earnings.,?
9795,Silly goose  and you say your $6 billion dam is a great project? LOL,?
9796,Logical fallacy - appeals to his degree (so what - lots of people have degrees; even PhDs but don't understand the most common sense realities).  What are your theological credentials?  Agree canon law does not exactly prepare you to handle some of life's difficult situations especially if you are a rigid legalist?  Do you know that there are different types of Magisterium?  Surprise!!!!  Please - no more shooting off your mouth.,?
9797,Trump is such an utter empty and vainglorious ineffectual and effete buffoon.,?
9798,Only complete fools would not want to know and understand the financial dealings of potential candidates.  Our menu of candidates has been so poor  lately  that it is essential to find out every aspect of a candidate's background including financial dealings.....ESPECIALLY financial dealings.  Because Trump is hiding something we must assume that he has been engaged in nefarious dealings.  We should have known what those dealings were before he even made it to the ballot.  (And  no  you right wing extremists....I did not like Hillary nor did I vote for her.),?
9799,I would recommend digging into the common Europens  the just love their country hard working normal people in many world countries. They get the same vote as your magazine writer. Wait a few months  I am no Jedi but someone is playing mind games with you.,?
9800,Trump will crush Hillary like the cockroach she is.,?
9801,Joe's not a guard. He's a guy who just goes around and takes pictures of airplanes. Other than that  he's a guy who hangs around pilots and tries to get his picture taken with a plane or in a cockpit. He doesn't even live on Whidbey  but he's appointed himself as the guy who needs to tell his s how to run our business.,?
9802,Anyone who cares what a bunch of pampered actors think is as stupid as the actors. But I am interested in what scientists think. I have never heard a scientist express a wish for Trump's death. But the vast  majority of educated scientists wish that he will be out of the White House as soon as possible.,?
9803,"President Obama thinks that "US is not good enough for the world".    Oh Charles  you really need to get treatment for your Obama Derangement Syndrome.    And quit using that black hair dye--it's rotting your brain!,?
9804,I don't like him. He is another phony intelectual. He has absolutely nothing to offer in today' s world. Another Trudeau error?,?
9805,The state needs to quit pussy-footing around and shut the company down until they remove the debris from the water.,?
9806,Wow you're an idiot. I am not sure I could post in a public forum if I was as dumb as you are.,?
9807,taipan  are you an old privileged white guy? sound like one. i'm one myself but i say 'god damn america' too. that flag only applies to white  christian  racist  bigoted and intolerant males. no one else. i thought i was alone but you have shown me that is not the case and for that i thank you.,?
9808,Did he ask for halal poutine?,?
9809,And the vast majority of murders in the US are family on family.  Your point is what?  I can continue to enjoy unfettered white privilege because blacks kill blacks in their own neighborhoods and whites kill whites during white supremacy demonstrations?,?
9810,You are proof positive then you can't fix stupid.,?
9811,Another recycled bureaucrat screwing up one agency and jumping to the next. Seems like bureaucrats have more job security than anyone else no matter how incompetent he/she is.,?
9812,You either believe in freedom and markets or you don't. This is where the rubber meets the road.,?
9813,Next time you watch bush people notice that their ALWAYS screwing off. Every Alaskan has a idea what it takes to live off the grid. Notice how much firewood they have stacked or are cutting/bucking/splitting or have cut from last year. Last fall they shot one deer for NINE people  give thanks for the Discovery Crew buffet. Their garden is the smaller than my front yard  again feed NINE people. The rumors as far as them living in town is not a rumor. I'm suprised it took this long for word to get out. They only go out to "Browntown" 2-3 days a week to film.,?
9814,16 million in a year divided by 75 000 doctors is $213 a year per physician.   Wow  it is endemic.   Those physicians are rolling in the dirty drug money!,?
9815,I enjoyed the column and agree with the point he made. I wish only good things for the Broncos and Brock Osweiler. Dilly Dilly!,?
9816,Mueller's problem is that he saddled someone else's ass.,?

9821,Many Canadians move to the USA for better weather especially sunshine sates like Florida  California Arizona Nevada etc.,?
9822,I know dozens of businesses without Wi-Fi.  How did this one get chosen for a degenerate advertorial?,?
9823,Fred Meyer offered to buy Richardi's property at a very good price.  Otherwise  they would give him easement. The easement was assured at a school board meeting before Jim Torrey changed his vote and killed the Fred Meyer proposal.,?
9824,sure are  every article has an anti-trump bent.,?
9825,A lot more criticism needs to be made of education studies. Too many people just accept the feel good results and never look deeper.,?
9826,You are nothing more than an empty head blowhard  regurgitating rhetoric like a good little parrot. You are worse than those who you malign because you make up lies and claim them as facts. Parrot on while we laugh at you.,?
9827,we can only hope he gets shanked to death. or shot in a transfer.,?
9828,"I don't accept that building a toll road means you can't also build anything else."  Well I don't "accept" that notion either  but it's exactly what's happening in this area  whether I accept it or not. The inadequate roads people need to use every day continue to be inadequate  and it won't change one iota if and when the parkway is built.,?
9829,Seriously!?!? If someone falls asleep  or is too inebriated  or passed out  they can't agree or say no to sex. If someone has sex with the person who is asleep  too inebriated or passed out  they are a RAPIST. I don't care if you are more violent. RAPE IS RAPE. You may have urges  CONTAIN THEM. I am so disgusted by this coming from an attorney! Perhaps the Bar Association should look into his ability to practice law.,?
9830,Obviously you uneducated Americans don't understand if your taxes are being audited that you can present them to the public because they're not done and no I do not support Drumpf I think he's a racist bigoted womanizing piece of crap that will ruin this country he'll probably just sell it to China while you're asleep  by the way American idiots his last name is DRUMPF he changed it when his family moved to America!!!!!!!!!,?
9831,When asked about the world's 85 richest people holding as much wealth as its 3.5 billion poorest people  NO'Leary said "it's fantastic" :  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqlxrQ2iE8s  Is he "mad-as-hell" that the 0.1% aren't richer  perhaps ?  Well  I'll give Yakabuka "stupid as hell" in the headline anyways.  If Trump-lite is all Canadian conservatives have left to offer  it's all over.  Fold the tent.,?
9832,BS.  I wish Freeland would keep her mouth shut  it will be ORDINARY Americans saying NO to Trump and his buffoons  no need to stick our nose in it,?
9833,We cannot say that because it has not been shown to be so.,?
9834,Explain "main street America " Nels.  The only party that's let us down is the Republicans Just Say No to Obama.  They tried but Obama came out alright after eight years of Republican obstructionism.,?
9835,Defense  Defense  Defense the scheme is not working and they are not adjusting or taking advantage of the other teams weaknesses.  Maybe time for a new DC...next man up.  Special teams are horrible. I really like Yolo and he has brought hope back to the program.  But ifnyou want to be champs get better coaching.,?
9836,More important than being the new PARTY OF NO  Democrats have to become the party of the BETTER IDEA.  Now that Mrs  Clinton has shown that she cannot win an election it is time for faithful Democrats to find  nurture  and support a whole slew of viable candidates for local and national office  who manifestly have better ideas.  Boat-loads of seats are up for election in two years ; Hillary was right when she said that America is Great because America is Good--it is time that we put that into action.,?
9837,Oh  I wouldn't characterize it as "hatred".  Try embarrassment  or dismay  or disbelief.  Hatred is what got the u.s. where it is  and see what that has created.,?
9838,Glad I never worked for any government. Too many stupid heads slow me down. Hate doing nothing and not being able to work for my pay.,?
9839,The world could eliminate war in a generation by getting serious about the rule of law. An international court that could jail any nation's leaders for wars of aggression  a court that held... Oh  why bother? Butler was right  war is a racket  and we are led by racketeers. Our country is bankrupt  and without the war industry  I wonder if economic depression would rapidly follow.  Hugh Massengill  Eugene Oregon,?

9841,More government bureaucratic failures!  Disgusting   incompetent  costly behavior!,?
9842,I was a Boy Scout and would have jumped at the chance to hear President Trump address our Jamboree.  These kids will never hear this in their public schools or newspapers but have witnessed first hand what is happening in America.  As a Boy Scout I was taught to respect law and order as well as the United States of America.  Today kids in public schools are being taught the reverse.  They are being taught to question laws and the established order and that the United States is evil.  The United States is not evil.  America is still the most sought after country on the planet to reside and to make a living.  Thank you President Trump  you are a great President!,?
9843,M-80s in mailboxes. Those were the days.,?
9844,It is known that the Hawaiian chain has been hit with  massive and giant tsunamis in the historic past based on archeological evidence.  Such an event may have possibly ended the Polynesian exploration and voyaging of the Pacific as it is known that such voyaging ended rather abruptly and with no clear explanation.  Loss of voyaging canoes and skilled and really irreplaceable navigators in societies that had no written language and where knowledge and skills were painstakingly handed down would have been devastating. What happened in the past can and will happen again.,?
9845,Hey! Oil company subsidies! Tax credits! You know  the great Republican gift to Big Oil. We said repeal that before you take our dividend and impose an income tax. What the heck happened? Why can't you Republicans hear us?,?
9846,and yet another bias left wing stupid column of hate    the left is truly sick,?
9847,WTF ! If he is proven guilty I hope he gets life in prison.,?
9848,Unsurprising an Islamophobe like you wouldn't recognize it.,?
9849,Guy dies doing something stupid (probably after a few too many drinks)  and now the family is hoping for a payoff by playing the lawsuit lottery.,?
9850,Every where the Muslims go they make trouble.They think every one that doesn't agree with their pedophile Mohammed is not worthy.Maybe they should try to assimilate to their new home and quit being whiny assholes for once,?
9851,Traffic school Mr. Clung? i find it hilarious. Taking it in good humor. What did you learn? I learned: Once  in MT I asked why speeding is against the law  why do they build cars that can go 130mph+? I mean that isn't really fair to have a car capable  but not allowed to test it.  Officer's response was brilliant. He took me on a ride along. We reached really high speeds  100+. We were on car chase pursuit actually. After the driver got arrested...he turned to me and said  "that's why." I said  "I want this job!" We became friends. Then awhile after that I moved to Kent.I asked one of the Sargent's in Kent if I could drive once. I think he fell out of his chair. He was silent for a moment  then I couldn't tell what mood he was in. I think mad from the way he yelled through the phone. Do not mess with Kent PD. That is what I learned. 😂. They are tough. Uncrackable. So tough lessons learned. We learned  we grew. I appreciate  love these officers so much!!! They are what we need  hugs.,?
9852,That guy's got huge girly tits and nipples!,?
9853,why not? we got plenty money to give to Democrat cronies. probably come with 6 month warranty too.,?
9854,I guess all white conservatives are now labeled "white supremacists" by the liberal pathetic lying media turds and turdettes. They are disgusting.,?
9855,Man look at that face. She looks like the walking dead.,?
9856,Who's got the money and the impetus to open 1002? There is a GLUT of the stuff in the USA. What would be the point? By the time it's on line  oil will be worthless. No more oil wars!,?
9857,you do realize that a bunch of kids killed a woman when they wanted to rob her son of his weed and money.  before that a kid hit a man in the head with a hammer for weed that only amounted to less than 50$ worth.    the kids of today arent the kids we were in the past who wouldnt do something that stupid or meaningless.,?
9858,Trump is a loathsome sociopath.  He owns health care now in the U.S.  Think about that  folks.  An incompetent buffoon who has failed at every single thing he touched since taking office is running Trumpcare.,?
9859,This is completely idiotic.,?
9860,Good luck on locating the gas  it would have great positive effects on the Copper Basin.,?
9861,Right  wing political trash is still political trash! It can come in the form of a Bush  Trump or a Harper but it is all the same.  The selection of corruption being put in place as the incoming Trump Administration will render the coffers of the USA taxpayers to that of a third world country! Pray I a wrong!,?
9862,Move on and endure the consequences he had brought unto himself.   With that being said and what I can peel back by what is written in the article about his decision to stand during the National Anthem...perhaps something has happened in his life (?).  Regardless  as initially commented  consequences are what they are.,?
9863,majority of Americans support the Dreamers.  really?  then why did they not vote for the candidate representing the legacy of Obama?  huh?,?
9864,"Anyone who nowadays want to be a politician or already is  is in reality  a scum of the earth."  So Murkowski and Sullivan have been scumbags for years.  And Young has been a scumbag for decades.  Got it.,?
9865,The magistrate system is one thing that needs to be changed. Under the current system they answer only to presiding judge Morse (the guy who cost Alaska half it's PFD). Not to the Judicial Conduct Commission  not to the voters in a retention election  etc. Judge Morse has made excuses for Magistrate Martin Fallon holding an "informal" hearing...as in no right to force witnesses against you to be named or testify  no producing evidence  changing his rulings after he discovers the law doesn't allow for them  etc. We need more voter oversight to the Alaska court system.,?
9866,Explain FOX News.  Oh that;s right  you cannot or will not.  repubs are liars like their dear leader.,?
9867,What a pug ugly thug.  I love how he thinks he matters because his daddy is a kind-of somebody.  "Blood of the city"  lol... time for a little blood letting to improve the city's health and safety!,?
9868,the POTUS is soooo petty  and pathetic.  Country first....Not crappy line of clothes,?
9869,What filthy churches harbor criminals?,?

9871,Republicans are sore winners  led by a sore whiner and play very dirty.,?
9872,After reading this article I am not sure that the Exon Valdez really pulled us out of an economic recession or not. What I do know after cruising around Prince William Sound for the last 7 years and seeing with my own eyes is that there are still bays and coves where you just need to dig down 4 or 5 inches and you can find an oily gue from that needless tragedy. Some fisheries here have never recovered. The next time you watch some slick oil and gas advertisement think about the thousands of families whose lives were destroyed in 1989. Ps: For you trolls out there who want to turn this comment into a: oh boy here is just another whining liberal. Believe me I am no liberal.,?
9873,Budget cuts? Really? Since when does the state care about money?  Dude is a scum bag deserves a beheading for looking at kids? but still  the thought of even pursuing something so stupid?  If he won't let you on his property let him burn no laws broken there  he didn't hurt anyone or start the fire.. Sounds to me the Government didn't have a leg to stand on  once again just harassing the people like police!,?

9878,Virtually none of these migrants will ever be deported despite any suggestions to the contrary.  There will simply be a mass amnesty since we lack the manpower to enforce anything else under due process once they get inside our borders.  There were 3 800 documented arrivals in Quebec alone during the first two weeks of August.  They must be prevented from entering by defending the border  like they did in Macedonia and Hungary.,?

9883,Arty   individual street corner murders don't make the news (unless an officer is involved)   but they do add up.  I don't remember any year with more than 200 domestic terrorism victims since 2001   but each year we have 10 000 "regular" murders.  Ignoring the 10 000 to concentrate on the 59 is understandable owing to press coverage  but the bigger picture might show us a way to reduce the overall toll.,?
9884,Fear mongering by a politician ultimately hurts everyone in the community except  occasionally  the politician.

9889,You want to be VULGAR and show your IGNORANCE.  I will dismantle YOUR "STUPID" comment and supposed DEFENSE apart. First off   this was not YOUR house  YOU are renting it.  Now  by your own ADMISSION in your comment  YOU are responsible for this fire because you set the generator to close to combustible materials.  Talk about shooting yourself in the foot.  DUH........ Anyone who uses the Whackey Tabaky  aka  Weed  Devils Salad  Idiots Cabbage   Pot   Gongi  have shown to use EXTREMELY POOR JUDGEMENT and have little COMMON  sense  as evidenced in this situation.  Whether you have renters insurance or not  ( I would bet you do not  correct me if I am wrong)  either the insurance co. or the house owner should come after you for damages by your own admission.  I am APPALLED   that you are attempting to use your SON for sympathy and trying to  blame this fire on  a rented generator.  You  made another  FALSE statement  "This was no ones fault"   BULL  its your FAULT.  Accept responsibility,?

9895,Let's leave aside consideration of the xenophobic characteristics of your comment.  Purely from an economic perspective this is false.  Our economy is well served by aspirational immigrants who live and work in our country.   The actual issues surround foreign investment.  In the first case  foreign money buying real estate for the purpose of appreciation  without living there.  In the second case  a large amount of foreign investment driving up real estate prices and then selling or renting back those places to residents at usurious prices.  Please let's deal with the actual issue and avoid attracting the race baiters and haters.,?

9897,You obviously aren't aware that everything you mentioned was a restriction put in place. My point  which for some reason you can't fathom  was it was EASIER. No tax stamp  no waiting for paperwork. Just go to the hardware store and buy your Thompson  no questions asked. Hell  Hiram Maxim made a supressor kit for a 94 Winchester. You could send away for it no questions asked  no tax stamp. Try that today.,?
9898,When I started working at the same job over 40 years ago   I took the job based on it's entire compensation package. I earned the benefits I enjoy today .Your jealousy just doesn't allow you to accept this fact. No matter how many times you make your false statement   it doesn't change the truth . I am living the dream thanks to all my hard work. I don't sit around   I enjoy all life has to offer. I just got back from seeing Paul McCartney with a VIP pass and seat center stage   fourth row. Ain't that cool  ? During that time your sitting around worried about my great life.  Who are the free loaders ? Those who don't help support America at the expense of those who do. Those who pay nothing for Obamacare love it. Those who's insurance rates are sky rocketing don't. You seem to be all for those not helping and against those who are. Just imagine   if everyone helped just a little   America would become even greater. The car don't run if you fill the gas tank with 40 percent free loaders,?

9901,[Your right .. nothing to show but disgrace to our country's.] Let's get this straight.  FWIW brought up old news  and fallaciously  in regards to the topic of the politics around Comey's firing.  And you're feeding off that old news regardless of relevance to the topic?  You just want to bitch about Hillary because it is insignificantly tangential to the current discussion?  Feel free.  It was a tragedy.  But don't expect me to take your irrelevant ranting seriously.,?

9911,Yes it was a good performance but the Editor is stretching the truth  since when do you get credit for a one hit gem  if you get pulled in the 7th inning. Nolan Ryan pitched  235 pitches in one game 13 innings  .,?
9912,"Trump was (is) a very successful  moral businessman until he entered politics and now has been unfairly trashed "  With all due respect to the letter writer  this statement is ridiculous and without merit.  1. Moral? Grab em by the pussy! Accused by nearly twenty women of sexual assault. Married three times. Stop it. 2. Unfairly trashed? Please refer to line #1. 3. Very successful businessman? If your dad gave you several million dollars (or the 1 mil Trump FALSELY claims) and a fat Rolodex  you'd be a successful businessman too  more than likely.,?

9914,Matthews pestered Trump as in badgered  hounded  nagged  hassled etc. him into saying something stupid. This from a guy who once said he was glad Hurricane Sandy hit the northeast because it helped Obama get elected. I don't support Trump  just think Matthews is a hypocrite and dirtbag.,?
9915,Trump is an idiot and it is idiotic to expect him to be anything different. However  the damage he has done to the US Presidency even before he takes office is much bigger than this. The US public elected a complete incompetent to be President. What is to stop them from doing so again? The world cannot wait on Americans to take their responsibilities to the rest of us seriously. The time has come to hedge against American power.,?
9916,This captain is a disgrace to his uniform  the department. Instead of taking his punishment and moving on  he is trying to cash in. His career  I'm sure he must realize  is now over--- unless he'd like to work in some backwater as a beat cop.  Not only a creepy cop  a creepy guy all around.  The timing of the chief's leaving makes one wonder if his inaction wasn't the death knell for him. There seriously is something wrong in the "old boy" operation of our police department. The fact is that the union head terrifies those that should be in control. Seriously messed up.,?
9917,It doesn't really matter if the DNC paid for it  it's routine political campaign activity and entirely legal. It was initiated by an unnamed GOP client during the Repug primaries and taken over by the DNC  something wight-ringers will try hard to get people to forget.,?

9919,Anything from cnn is going to be scripted against the president far in advance or it will just be completely false news like the russia narrative they were pushing for the last 6 months. Now Trump is a racist and mentally ill on top of that. Cnn leans towards BLM and ANTIFA just like MSNBC.,?
9920,Let the neo-nazis and white supremacists who voted for Trump pay for the wall. No one else cares.,?
9921,No there have not 'always been limits to campaign contributions'.  The first campaign finance law was passed in 1974.  And it should have been declared immediately unconstitutional just as the SCOTUS decided in Newberry v US in 1925.  And no there have not always been limits on people spending their own money however they wish even when there have been unconstitutional laws prohibiting contributions to candidates.,?
9922,I'm not 100% there either - it's only 2 games.  Just keep in mind both the Chargers and Cowboys did try to force him to beat them. The book on Denver  as it has been since Week 1 last year  was to stop the run and force the Broncos to pass the ball.   Unlike last year (for the most part)  he's taking advantage of the great matchups he's getting in the secondary.,?
9923,Maduro is a narco-dictator thug who starves and kills his citizens while growing fat and lazy. His country is deteriorating in every way  yet he dances salsa on his TV program.,?

9925,So your point is that this time period now   this era   the construct of masculinity is sexually assaulting women ? Garbage,?
9926,Actually its more than that. Other than the Cowboy game  the defense has given up passing yards to a less than stellar Charger offense  Buffalo offense and barely beat the Raiders. One good game out of five is not reflective of the defensive talent the Broncos have. Lets see what you have to say when we are 8 and 8 or worse at seasons end.,?

9933,Bankish:   Then what you have done is right for you. And that is really all that matters  right?    I happen to own 15 stocks in total (4 banks  smaller positions)  with my main focus on the more regulated pipelines and utilities sectors  because their cash flows and dividend increases are as reliable as anyone could expect.   My current portfolio yields ~ 5% and should  and almost certainly will increase that dividend income by roughly 8% per yea over the next several years.   I checked online to see what the chartered banks' numbers were estimated to be going forward. Over the next three years  their avergae eps are estimatd to increase by 2.8%  then 5.8% and 4.9%. Of course these are just estimates and subject to revision. But if these numbers are even close  they are well below the anticipated increases that are likely to come from the more conservative and diversified pipeline and utility portfolio where a +8% increase is expected.      FYI in that 07-09 collapse  ENB was +2%,?
9934,And then along came LBJ  the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts  and the instant conversion of all those Dixiecrats turned into ultra right wing Republicans. How soon you forget.,?
9935,Stephen you are a Jerk.  Karen made a nice post.  You don't need to be the "grammar police" against someone's grandmother.,?
9936,I would also like to suggest that if Ms. Doolittle wishes to establish her viewpoint as credible  she make one simple admission;  some complainants lie about sexual assaults.  While the number may be very small  and the reasons varied   there are false complaints.  And  for this reason  investigations have to be thorough  and unbiased.,?
9937,Harry Kim on his worst day is better than the foul-mouthed dishonest drunk Billy Kenoi.,?
9938,Trump has made his allegiances clear: He’s on the side of white supremacists  white nationalists  ethno-racists  Islamophobes and anti-Semites. He is simpatico with that cesspool. And nothing gets his goat quite like racial minorities who stand up for themselves or stand up to him.,?
9939,Disgusting.,?
9940,Good comments from the Gruening Middle School. I would have expected those comments to come from adults in the state government In Juneau. A commenter said they were from a mindset of entitlement. Yet the commenter says nothing about the $trillions being spent by the American taxpayer to create terrorism by invading and occupying other countries so conservative neo cons can go In and steal their resources for free.  With the $trillions going to create terrorists so a few bloodsuckers can profit  the commenter does not say America has to cannibalize its health and social programs in order to enrich the white billionaire club of parasites and leeches whose profits depend on how many people they can make suffer while slaughtering them. We are no different than the same leeches and parasites of the Imperial Roman Empire who killed the white mans jesus while stealing resources and lands.,?
9941,Sometimes you just have to shut up--even if you are an atheist. Your opinion is less than useless here.,?

9943,The problem is she is so stupid.  The Dems did it without Repub support.  So fix it without Dem support.  Then when it's all evened up  do it in a bipartisan way which is impossible with the Dems anyway.  Amore.  : - ),?
9944,managers know how to make the "best out of less"--Billy Martin and Sparky Anderson were classic examples of that--what you're seeing now is exactly how incompetent John Gibbons is (and always has been)--it was easy to ignore his bumbling when the team was winning (although that had nothing to do with anything Gibbons ever did) but now with this team losing his mistakes are even the more noticeable (especially in the clubhouse where there is absolutely no discipline etc)---the Blue Jays need to do what the Leafs finally did--get a manager/coach who knows what he's doing and then start restocking this team with young talent and don't make stupid trades of young players/draft picks just for very short term success (ie. Alex Anthropoulos)-this team needs to be "gutted" and that starts with Gibbons,?
9945,Ah  I see that so many of the hateful trolls (left  right  up  down ...) who I blocked in Disqus are now back in my face.  Trying to be "civil" here - this is not for me ... best to those of you whom actually contributed to conversations  ... as far as the "cesspool" description of the Disqus comments - the Denver Post allowed and encouraged that by not monitoring or axing obvious idiots and trolls ....,?

9947,Tax grab. But a good tax grab.,?
9948,He must be both!,?
9949,Are you kidding me ?  Our president can't have mental issues going in .  What if she had collapsed like she did a few weeks back when North Korea was about to launch rocket towards Alaska   which it has the range to hit ?  She clearly doesn't have the needed stamina to be president .  Nearly everyone agree's the health of those running for president matters.,?

9952,You are quite right Mike:  Media consolidation is a problem to be solved.  Unfortunately it very much looks as if things are heading in the direction of more consolidation not less.

We are already down the rabbit hole Mike  and it's going to get a whole lot worse before it gets better (which won't be in my lifetime).,?

9961,Here's what California Senator Kamala Harris thinks about it:      22 million more people would be uninsured over the next decade with nearly 50 million uninsured overall by 2026  thanks to Medicaid cuts;       The average premium for a standard health care plan will increase by 20% next year for millions of Americans;       And this plan to kick millions of people off their health insurance is all so the Republicans can provide wealthy donors with a tax cut. It's downright immoral.   This is not a moment to sit on our hands. We must stop this bill from passing in the U.S. Senate. The numbers show that it’s time for my GOP colleagues to speak the truth. They know this legislation is bad; now they must stand up and stop it.,?
9962,you know chrsty1. You must be really stupid. You begin by saying you know "for a fact the old woman could work circles around" me. Then you continue by telling me that I should NOT "regurgitate" vomit against people I have no knowledge of or about!!!! You stupid moron you wrote exactly the kind of comment you suggested that I not write. You don't know me!!! But you "know for a fact"""""yada yada yada. Moron!!!,?
9963,As you said  America is everyone's home  how about seeking common ground based on the real issues instead of what Trump may or may not do.  In my opinion America has become focused on getting your way regardless of the methods used or consequences. This is evidenced heavily by the DNC emails as well as the "spin" and out right lies by both major parties. Both parties are equally to blame here. It is further evidenced by the people in their "echo chambers" trading propaganda instead of researching genuine facts.  Instead of vilifying and demonizing people that have a different opinion than you  try to understand the reasoning for their opposing opinion. We as a people need to move back to the days of reasonable compromise and respect of differing opinions. We need to draw social lines where one group is able to oppress another  prohibiting these actions equally.  Most importantly  we need to demand self accountability for ones actions  hold everyone to the same standard.,?
9964,Didn't know Mother Theresa was running for the job. Good choice if that's what you want. This is a strange city and sometimes it is difficult to distinguish the good from the bad.  I would like t know the number of felony arrest she has made and the number of times her work effort resulted in convictions and prison terms for serious violators.  Seems like a paper mini cop.  Oddly enough the commission has just weakened the department for the sake of political correctness.  A total 180 degree move.  Maafala says she is like a mother and a supervisor.  Who better than your mother for a boss.  Not good.,?
9965,The Animal Control Officers and veterinarians now say they are busy dealing with problems caused by other breeds since the ban  namely Labrador and Golden Retrievers that are bigger dogs.   The minister you mention didn't want to get into debate about the ban or the case of road rage where he killed a cyclist.,?
9966,You didn't answer my question. Let's try again. What has been the cause of warming since ~1700?,?
9967,Trump is an incompetent fool who only cares about getting elected again in 4 years.  And this EO is stupid and incompetent.  BUT   Google thinks its the big wheel in the economy when its really not.  As Biden pointed out   GM trimmed multiple times the whole of Google's workforce in 2008.   Google has great market capital and the zeitgeist but its not the driver of the US economy.,?

9973,You have no business making any comments on this site  Craig.  For all the  bigot and racists comments that you've personally posted on this site against rural Alaska Natives  the homeless  and the LGBT community  you should be banned from this site.  Alaska and the nation don't need your kind breathing our air.  No.  It's not time to move on.

And idiots who have no clue what is REALLY going on and can only act like bobble head dashboard dummies .  He gave an absolutely wonderful speech tonight that will be shown decades from now as one of the  best handoffs in out National history .,?

And we do not use salt on the road because it corrodes the vehicles and poisons the environment. That aside  I still think that the City Hall should be in the EWEB building.,?
9979,Wanting our president to fail to analogous to wanting the pilot of the airplane to fail. Stupid. And the march for equality  mutual respect  inclusiveness and appreciation of diversity doesn't really want pro-life women there. Stupid AND hypocritical.,?

9982,Oh  good grief....that is your bitch  TR? Must be a slow news day at the WE....,?
9983,One thing I would say  Chad  to add onto your description of where Charles Djou goes from here  is that while he has all the personal hallmarks of a good campaigner  he fails to craft a message that really resonates with the general voter population. Now is that because of party affiliation? Well  when he ran for Congress  it sure seemed that all he wanted to do is copy and paste lines from the national GOP.   For this race for Mayor  he didn't do that. However the attraction of a message that basically boiled down to a "everything is Caldwell's fault  so vote for me" didn't work well here. He should have taken the lesson from the 1970 primary between Burns and Gill  which the same thing was done by Gill against Burns. And you see how that turned out.   Perhaps with Trump being president  Charles can redeem himself enough in his eyes to get a federal appointment.,?
9984,I do not believe he is either of those things.  If you really look at hist comments and his actions  they do not fall into those categories.  Now you answer my questions  do you support the murder of unborn babies  and do you support the racist policy of affirmative action?,?

9986,There is another thing about the American tourist  other than mostly great guests of the State.  Somehow  they forgot to pack their common sense and most of their brains at home in their own State.  Keeping you and your children safe in paradise only takes a few minutes of your time reinforcing the rules of safety when visiting a strange place.   Even locals drown  fall off mountainsides  and yes  they even get lost when they deviate off the trails in the dense mountainous vegetation.  Why does the tourist feel the host people can keep tourists safe in every situation where a naive decision was made to do something you have never chanced to do in your own world at home?  If you indulge in drinking heavily off shore until you're whacked out of your mind....  say no more!   It is plain stupid choices  and made at your own risk!,?
9987,how about the authorities make it abundantly clear that NO ONE will get rescued? After a couple of people die with no one helping them  the rest of the idiots will get the message.,?

9991,Trump making such idiotic statements forces his staff and Republicans in Congress to spend energy trying to construct in the real world the alternate reality that exists in his head.  Just like with healthcare  it ain't happening.  Worst ever.,?
9992,For what Trump has done to fire up the racist cretins in this country he deserves nothing less than having an anvil dropped on his head looney tune style--only with real world consequences. I truly wish the guy had a molecule of shame since it might make him predisposed to suicide but shame requires a conscience so no luck there.  But as for what he has done for the Republican party--really what they've done to themselves in their own infinite stupidity--it is truly beautiful to behold.  I cannot tell you how giddy I get thinking of evangelicals on election day  either not voting or pulling the lever for Donald Trump. This too is supremely beautiful in its irony.,?
9993,Russian troll alert!,?
9994,This is a complete lie. How does this garbage get printed? Lies 100% lies. WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE MEDIA?,?
9995,I have been reading a lot about Walmarts new focus "e-commerce " to compete with Amazon etc. So they may be focusing on online sales more and more  not just brick and mortar store-fronts?,?
9996,Neko...I have helped at 5 terminal cancer deaths and God "permitted them all" .....God has been "permitting a lot of horrific stuff throughout the ages ...disease  concentration camps  tribal warfare  natural disasters et al..  The argument that a caring God who identifies with every hair on ones head wouldn't "permit" such suffering is clearly not the case....what we do to help IS  in my view  the issue...sort of a Matthew 25 deal.  Thanks for your concern...think the weather may be helpful with some of "Gods rain"...quite soon...,?
9997,Modern Toronto is garbage  a slave wage cesspool. It used to be a nice place where people lived balanced lives. Now it is a greedy slimy cesspool.,?
9998,'doesn't rule put a preemptive strike' - on what basis and justification  I ask?  If anyone followed the events of the past 20 years  all the so-called 'goodwill gestures' towards NK were empty. Not once did the US agree to a non-aggression pact  or direct and REAL talks. All the threats coming out of NK are a bluster. Tillerson should go the NK and talk. It is that simple.,?
9999,another arrogant divisive Lib. and she doesn't even have nice hair.,?

10012,"The ACA was the result of almost a full year of open cabinet meetings and hearings  with input taken from everyone in congress  medical and insurance professionals  and *gasp* the American people."  The plan was presented by Pelosi on July 9  2009  just 7 months after Democrats took the White House & began planning for a health care overhaul. November 7  2009  the HOR voted on it.  The Senate had their first vote on it December 24  2009.  In January a special election was held & the candidate who campaigned hard against ACA in a heavily Democratic state won. That would be the people speaking  but the Democrats weren't listening  because they decided to use a special maneuver in March to get it passed without the needed 60 votes they had expected until Brown was elected. President Obama signed it into law March 23  2010  just 8 1/2 months after it was introduced. I don't know where you get your "almost a full year of open meetings" but the timeline doesn't support that assertion.,?
10013,Interesting but I have believed for decades that Norma & Lester Cobb filed the last homestead claim in Fairbanks on their  Lost Creek Ranch located between Rampart and Eureka Alaska,?
10014,Good riddance  it was a stupid/vote garnering idea to begin with.,?
10015,' There's a true Alaskan American  eh?    Cheering for Russia' interests     ...and hoping Alaska can serve the motherland's interests.  . He's as traitorous as his treasonous daddy figure and Putin's puppet  Trump. .,?

10017,What a sick and twisted comment. You are demented   you Jenny....are uncivil as is this pretend news publication. Maybe next time some demented terrorists will kill some of your family to pay for the CIA's deeds  you are a pervert. Lets not forget that.  Cheers!,?
10018,An idiot?  That got himself elected President of the US.  What does he have to do not to be regarded as an idiot by you?  Come on tell us.       If you are looking for idiots look no further than Ontarians that voted the Wynne into office.  .,?

10021,"...roll eyes the moment some WASP..."  Hello denglish4   Why the racist  bigoted  hateful targeting of WASPs?  Why are you filled with seething  racist bigotry against specifically WASPS and not specifically against white Catholics or White atheists from Spain and Greece?  Why do you target WASPS in your hatred-motivated attacks? Why are they the only white people raising your bigoted resentment and hate?,?
10022,all so some punk could have his glory and shoot a cop. soon there will be numerous idiots calling for his freedom...the fairbanks 1 they will call this idiot.,?
10023,Really dumb of Trudeau to wade into an event where the audience wasn't pre-screened to assure that only soft-balls would be lobbed at him.     Didn't he learn anything by observing the previous Govt while in opposition?     Wasn't there a bathroom to hide in?,?
10024,You lump "All Muslims" together in your protective little enclave.  The killers along with the innocent.  An attack on Sharia law is bigotry against 'all Muslims'.    Anyone who protests Sharia law is a bigot and/or a racist.  Anyone who points out that the killers claim to be Muslims is a bigot and/or a racist.  Anyone who disagrees with you is a bigot and/or a racist is my conclusion.,?
10025,"The students in his classes are presumably able to understand statistical data and look up terms in Wikipedia  and the ones whose hands shoot up to try to catch him out on trivialities because they can't keep up in general probably shouldn't be there."  When I attended University graduating in '71 we had text books and many of us read ahead of the professor  using the lecture/classroom time to clarify points that we had not grasped on our own or in consultation with our peers.  I personally don't believe to this day that the existence of the Internet and a site like Wikipedia is an excuse for a poor or sloppy presentation by anyone.  I had an English professor who told the class on day 1  "you will submit 6 essays and I will give you a mark on the average of the best 5.  My 6th essay was a letter to the professor reminding him of my A average on my previous 5 submissions and trusting he would award me a mark based on my best 5 submissions...the letter was returned with an A+ :),?
10026,That was confirmed by the Comet Pizza Investigation.,?
10027,What is always amusingly stupid about uneducated flat earther types is their many ridiculous assumptions like the climate scientists having never considered the sun as the cause -- which they have and the evidence/facts dismiss it.  https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwi-ytmH_crTAhWD3YMKHeXfAt4QFggrMAE&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.yaleclimateconnections.org%2F2015%2F10%2Fearths-warming-how-scientists-know-its-not-the-sun%2F&usg=AFQjCNH2eD8G1WHtj-XJrO3bfSA-4-ul_w And then there are plenty of long debunked flat earther lines of BS to debunk repeatedly  like the "satellite data shows no warming for 13 years!!!" kinda garbage.  https://thinkprogress.org/climate-deniers-favorite-temperature-dataset-just-confirmed-global-warming-838eb198e246  Quite frankly I think it is quite irresponsible for any publication with the publics interest in mind  to post or print any of their zombie lies and ignorance-based opinions.,?
10028,One of the guns used in the Columbine massacre  a TEC DC9  was covered under the 1994 "assault weapons" ban. That ban didn't do squat except punish decent gun owners and we all know it.,?

But he still is building the wall and making Mexico pay for it.  And he did show us proof that Obama was a Muslim born in Kenya.  It's out there if you want to believe.........as I assume 32% of you do  lol,?
10031,Wasteful Ontario colleges have blown their budgets and reputations on admin instead of teaching quality. Their rankings have tanked in the higher education world. Shut down these expensive roach motels. Lock up Wynne before she throws away more money to cheats and professional beggars.,?
10032,Hey Joe  you sound like a Russian piece of sh i t  trying to divide us Americans. Amirite? Nice try. If i'm not right  it's sad that i think your a fking ruskie.

10037,This woman  Chrystia Freeland  went on US television last year and stated that it was wrong to criticize certain segments of the Muslim population for honour killings  female genital mutilation  and persecution of gays.  She is a far-left  bat*** crazy  cultural marxist.,?
10038,With Trump in the White House  Putin is getting a wink and a nod to continue his efforts to undermine NATO and the EU. Trump is helping anyway he can.,?
10039,Alaska has to find a way to make drilling and finding big oil discoveries and find that way fast.   Oil and Gas companies everywhere need a reason to come and invest in Alaska oil industry  any ideas?  These Legislators and the Governor are like scarecrows that keep investors out of Alaska's oil business!,?
10040,November surprise. You are waking up in november to salute trump one morning. Dont let your head explode.,?
10041,To translate SenecaJones' legalese into realspeak: ""EWEB let us twist their arm and cheat the ratepayers so badly that they might be angry enough to seek retaliation.   Newsflash for the racketeers over at SenecaJones: If you've defrauded ratepayers so badly that you are paranoid of their revenge  please don't assume that your victims cannot eventually avail themselves through legal and lawful means to exact the redress from you which they sorely deserve. Good luck crying wolf  fraudsters.   This is pathetic. What a scam SenecaJones has engaged in. Caught red handed  too.,?
10042,I know most people really like those songs and they are very loving and highly worshipful.  I like the ones that I have sung during mass.  Maybe because they are not sung in Latin?,?

10046,Another crash caused by an incompetent Republican President...,?
10047,The first time I could vote  Reagan's good old American optimism and  personal charm won my vote.  Supply-side (trickle-down) economics made sense to a college kid looking ahead to a bright future.  Then  less than a year in office  his Office of Management and Budget whiz kid David Stockman admitted that no one really knew "what was going on with all those numbers."  I came to realize that a kindler  gentler world doesn't run like an equation  especially one that continually allows the rich to get richer---and the poor to get poorer.   I didn't vote for RR the next time  but never stopped liking him  never doubted his sincerity.  This ldiot inhabiting the White House is no Ronald Reagan.  And his wife doesn't love him.,?
10048,I presume you know that your statement is idiotic.  If not  I do feel sorry for you.,?
10049,> Once the socialists really get a handle on this  Ontarians and Canadians  they'll pull a 'national socialist' agenda into plain view.   LOL. What a butt-headed stupid post.   If you were "educated" in Ontario  I dare say whomever was in charge of the government while you were getting your schooling ought to be thoroughly embarrassed as they never quite finished the job on you.,?
10050,Had a little time when not outraged at Fox Shep turning RINO? There are balance pieces on there all the time for multiple writers. But you know that. And by knowing that you are attempting to insinuate and mislead anyone that might wonder if there were truth that ADN was nothing more than a libtard rag. Or is it provide a little self congratulatory prop for conservatives to nod all seriously and knowing like to each other. Free speech? Bwa ha ha! Cuz  you know  set your sarcasm aside and the only thing that's left is another POS whiny conservative snowflake that likes to think he's being muzzled and never  ever  super  very very much gets say what he wants of thinks. Or so he's heard. Cuz truthiness matters. Alt-facts optional. And voters are idiots.  *Zieg Heil to the President....kill all the fgs who don't agree* Hat tip to Green Day. Hope they have a new one for trump.,?
10051,Pathetic.  This city hauls in so much money  yet we have to use volunteers to clean it up.  What a joke.,?
10052,Until you can point to a specific statute of the law that was violated  I will assume that you suffer from Trump derangement syndrome.,?
10053,Waivers and freebies like tax breaks.  Of course  we the loyal citizens of Honolulu will have to pay.,?
10054,Ergo  not an exercise of their First Amendment rights.,?
10055,Agree fully with the article. Canada's dairy supply management system is not worth defending in the upcoming 2.0 Nafta negotiations. In fact  I shudder to think what would have to be given up in order to conclude a new trade agreement that does leave the system in tact.,?
10056,I have to question the personal character of anyone who supports Trump. If after everything we have seen and heard from Trump and knowing that he gave potentially life endangering top secret info to Russia   put a man who was already under investigation into the NSA etc etc etc ...I have to assume that you are a low life scum bag who would steal others blind and worse . If you are a Trump supporter after all is said and done   you suck as a human being,?
10057,Because its hate against White people. Only works if you are a minority  gay ect....ever hear of the WET (White entertainment tv) nope  not politically correct but its ok to have the BET (Black entertainment tv). How about the NAAWP( national association for the advancement of White people) nope  not politically correct but the NAAACP (national association for the advancement of Colored people) is OK. How about the congressional Black caucus...OK but its a no no to have a congressional White caucus. Its politically correct to hate White people  nothing racist about it.,?
10058,Yuk  yuk  yuk  hardy har  har. FAIL! Not as utterly stupid as those with unbridled armament who voted for the fat  gold painted  cheeto jesus.,?

10061,Dershowitz is a scumbag who vocally supported torture under the Bush regime.  His "ethics" are whatever suits his whims from time to time.  He is a perfect acolyte of the Blue Church.  A really bad man.,?
10062,Thanks for your efforts and the work of the Denali Citizens Council  Nancy.  I've always found you to be a good communicator.  There won't be any constructive dialogue on this issue as long as the BOG holds all the power and calls dissenters "emotional.",?
10063,As usual  Djou is all talk but has no substance behind his claims.  Djou now wants to to build the rail portion that is not built at grade which means taking away lanes of traffic on some of our busiest streets in Honolulu!  This sounds like BRT  or bus rapid transit which is what former Mayor Harris and others were pushing for which Djou voted against when he was a councilmember!  This means taking one lane away from Ala Moana Blvd and Kapiolani Blvd  two of the most busiest streets!  Imagine all the traffic that will be backed up when Ala Moana Blvd goes from 3 lanes to 2 and the same for Kapiolani Blvd under a Djou Rapid Transit plan! Auwe!,?
10064,....or anything that happened before present day.,?
10065,While I highly doubt Mr Poplak needs me to defend his writing  I will say that 'fuck' is merely a word - a real word that can be found in the dictionary (right between 'fuchsia' and 'fuddle')  so why should there be a problem with using it for shock and emphasis? And honestly  if someone is going to be that badly affected by reading those four little letters  they're better off not reading Poplak's articles anyway  as he tends to deal with topics that are far heavier than one silly little swear word.  Or to put it another way  as Stephen Fry said: "If my words offend you  well so fucking what?",?
10066,Odd that you can't be bothered to read about why the rates of diagnosis (hint: focus on the word diagnosis if you decide to read) have increased.  The reasons are pretty well known and are not being kept secret.,?
10067,Article has error?  "For example  investors will see the cost of commissions from the purchase of mutual funds in their statements  but not the management-related fees of such products."  There would be NOTHING for mutual fund advisers to report if the MER fees were excluded. I suspect what is excluded is is the costs of the funds over and above the MER such as trading fees that the fund itself incurs. Or perhaps you mean the adviser will report only the portion of the MER that goes to the advisor and not the share kept by the mutual fund company.  Mutual Fund advisers have come under great criticism. But I believe they have their place especially for small portfolios. (I have no involvement in the mutual fund industry)  I briefly discuss the various adviser types in my article linked below:  http://www.investorsfriend.com/where-and-how-to-invest/,?
10068,Keep it up hoser. I never uttered or wrote that crap. You're a liar stuck in a pig fight with yourself. Don't forget the lipstick.,?
10069,jc96........You may be too young to know about Lenny Bruce......maybe not. One of his best lines was...and I paraphrase..  Two guys in prison.....one says to the other...what are you here for ??

Gamblng and Murder....killed a couple of guys in a crooked crap game....he says How did that get started....asks other guy Well.....It started when I was a kid playing bingo in the basement of the local Church .......  Hope you see the stupidity of present drug laws.......and past liquor laws  !! One is responsible for their own actions......NOBODY WENT TO JAIL FOR HAVING A DRINK......NOBODY SHOULD GO TO JAIL FOR RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA..... Over ninety per cent of cases that go to Court ...are for possession...(not dealing ..or producing)...and over half are thrown out...and only a small number result in a  conviction,?
10070,Pruitt is notorious for his collusion with special interests and is a top Trump boot lick  as are all of the administration's suckees. Until the spineless GOP sycophants decide they've had enough of the malignant narcissist and mentally deranged moron in the White House  Pruitt and the rest of the pathetic political degenerates in the administration will continue to engage in their malevolent activities designed to destroy the country.,?
10071,He didn't go because "it's 2017!".,?
10072,"Something notably stupid or foolish" would be the belief that the Trump's travel ban is making U.S. citizens significantly safer.  Stephen J. Remington,?
10073,You think he'll say Trump interfered with the investigation?  If he does  Comey goes to jail.  Think he's that stupid?  He won't say squat.  Mostly "I can't answer that question because of the ongoing investigation.",?
10074,hell no  trumpy is a white supremacist bigot to the bone.,?
10075,A daily brief on any wide ranging topic can get monotonous when little changes. When something important comes up  his staff can make sure he hears it...either straight from a briefer or from the cabinet secretary closest to the issue. The fact that the current POTUS takes a daily brief...every day  should be all the reason the next POTUS needs to do something different. It's not as if Obama solved all the world's ills by way of this daily brief.,?
10076,I think whatever you saw had it wrong or are outdated - the trade deficit is $48B that is the difference between what we buy and what we sell. We buy $48B more than we sell  so if we are selling $16B then we are buying $64B. In other words - it's worse than you think!,?
10077,Do you have any evidence to support this claim that DOES NOT come from Fox News  Breitbart  or the like?  Like  a reputable source?,?
10078,I can say the same for you.,?
10079,"Ostracizing and shaming people as examples to others" is a dark  menacing path.,?
10080,More often scammed.,?
10081,GET BACK TO WORK YOU JUNEAU SLACKERS.. Holy crap. Quite voting  for the incumbents  like- a decade ago.  >cracks whip<,?
10082,Lawyers please  you are only strengthening the dog analogy. Let’s instead fortify your (our) common interests- providing legal support to the less well heeled so they can at least have a chance at ‘justice’.  There are a myriad of options - doing legal aid work  contingency agreements (which may or may not yield a profit)  working for government or a not-for-profit. Sounds to me like we are all on the same side and probably also all value a little work-life balance.,?
10083,This column stinks,?
10084,Trump has a lot to learn about everything - he is unfortunately for us and the world  an ignorant  bullying narcissist.,?
10085,This is pretty shocking. I'd read this yesterday  but it didn't say where the attack was  just that it happened in Waikiki. I'd thought it was on the street. Being attacked in your hotel's elevator is not something you'd expect.,?

10088,NO NO NO! City council is too stupid and will probably say yes. The airlines have said no. The city council needs to say NO. The mayor needs to say NO. FIRE KIM DAY NOW!!!,?
10089,The only question you asked was leading and inaccurate.  You inquired about an event that never actually happened.  How civil is that?,?
10090,"What is crazier than Trump? Voting for" Hillary.  There.  Fixed it for you.,?
10091,Obama claimed he only knew what was in the news.,?
10092,Should be able to see your lack of comprehension then  eh?  I told you what I thought  babbling idiotic buffoons pushing unfounded right wing conspiracy theories.  Peer at it real hard and see if you can't make that out.,?
10093,Agreed. You can't reach the lost by being a judgmental jerk who makes kids cry. Christ calls real Christians to be compassionate and come along side people in there darkest days  not yell at them to repent as they come out of the bar. There's a time to talk about the consequences of sin but if you don't be compassionate first  nobody will care about what you have to say. Plus  a position of judgment is the worst place to preach from about sin. Paul constantly used his past to lovingly show that he understood where they were right then and he accepted them. When you can say "look  I've been where you are and have felt what you feel"  you will have much more of an impact. When people act like this  it makes the world think this is Christianity. Just my 2 cents.,?
10094,Yeah I got the crappy message first thing this morning  now as soon as I "submit" (something I've never been good at) I'll have to give my take about the comments  on stories I may not of even read yet. What shite,?

10105,Small government conservatism at its finest. When it comes to business and taxes and anything involving the common good they want government out of their lives and bang on about "freedom." When it comes to personal conduct they want the most expansive  intrusive government imaginable. Seriously  the anti government party is calling for police in the toilet.,?
10106,Notice no new spending from today to October 2019 election time !!! it's all front loaded BS  it will never happen!! I promise to give every Canadian 100 million dollars if you elect liberals in the 2043 election  all smoke and mirrors BS from the village idiot.,?

I just saw this earlier today and posted it under today's "Fact Checking" editorial:  “Sailor Denied ‘Clinton Deal ’ Gets 1 Year in Prison for 6 Photos of Sub”  http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/sailor-denied-clinton-deal-gets-1-year-in-prison-for-6-photos-of-sub/ar-BBvPAGD?li=BBnb7Kz  As you know  the law has nothing to do with truth but what one can get away with.,?
10111,No  just a plane and stupid ideas. Quebec will never get a grid like that. We in the  west have supported Quebec for to long. Now the West should separate from the East. We will look after ourselves and they can feed themselves.,?
10112,This post makes no sense  how are the democrats promoting an agenda in the NFL?   The whole reason there is anthem is because there was an agenda by the right to try to boost military recruitment.   Also sorry but you don't get it  and your making yourself look extremely ignorant by posting stuff like that. It's not anti-white it's anti white nationalism. Whites haven't been oppressed  whites have oppressed. I find nothing to be proud about being a white person myself. Our history is disqusting and anyone who is proud of that history and condemns this protest is an ignorant racist who supports the communist in chief who's trying to take away American rights which you're defending lol. Unreal.,?
10113,The officers involved in the operation said he "bloody lied " about his role in it . That clearly goes well beyond just exaggerating .,?
10114,Pfft... I don't think the State of Alaska cares about this so called crime. the walrus did what they naturally do. you sadistic ...,?
10115,You are the dumbest idiot on this planet  yes with each other  they are different bands - and there is a federal treaty with FN. Go jump off a cliff.,?
10116,Hey kuro finally seeing the light. Must be a damn kick to the balls. Hallelujah righteousness prevails.,?
10117,You must be a troll from Outside.  There is no state tax. How clueless can you be.,?
10118,Awesome Mr. Sean Schroeder!!! You're definitely a cool  giving and unselfish guy. Mahalo for giving back to Hawaii and for your open mindedness....,?
10119,It's amazing. Liberalism is a mental disease  and everyday there's something posted somewhere that proves it. Congrats  you're first today!!!,?
10120,Neither did Bill Clinton.  The reactors that were promised to replace the heavy water reactor was never built.  N. Korea was building two additional heavy water reactors on their own.  Oh  and the very first bomb wasn't tested until 2006 after N. Korea restarted their heavy water reactor in 2003.  It's GWB's fault.,?
10121,What's next? A doctor can't tell a patient he's too fat or needs to start eating right? All this stuff is relevant. Mental health is a part of physical health.,?
10122,Alan...baby....these are not conservatives.  These are your people  liberals  liberal jews  skin heads  blacks  black separatists   lesbians  LGBTetc.  In other words every fragmented fringe group block of nut burgers balled up is your little party and they support a death cult that uses useful idiots (Palestinians) as their tool of choice to drive a wedge in Israel.   You wanted anarchy?  It's here  it's at your door.  Answer it....go ahead  answer that door.,?
10123,The lineage of hate is much longer than that.,?
10124,Also... time to put these clowns in a low rent facility in Anchorage on the poorer side of town with open door policy  lets get the disenfranchised to have the ability to show up and speak truth to these crooks on our teat....,?
10125,No  it was not built on the premises of white supremacy and eternal slavery for blacks.,?
10126,If  businesses are being forced to change due to this ordinance where is the balance  once you become a business owner your own civil liberties and rights are no longer important? That is what the State of Washington is telling me.,?
10127,The citizens knew that she had ZERO experience working in government.   Yet  they elected her anyway.  Vinis is simply a liberal female version of Trump.   Both are incompetent fools.   Complete idiots.  This is the new norm for our public officials: incompetence.,?
10128,Lol. Are you joking ? Do you even know how solar panels work? You cannot build a wall from them.... more like a ramp maybe because they have to face UP toward the the sun. Ramps for Mexicans to ride dirt bikes over like a latino Evil Knevil. As  in the daily show commentary. If you are not joking  you exemplify how ignorant Trump supporters are.,?
10129,Yes  this is the new norm for behavior in our society now.  American is becoming a nation of scumbags.   America celebrates and loves scum now.  If this upsets you so much  then you should move to Canada.  Things will be getting far worse than this  in this years to come.,?
10130,If The Canadian Medical Association  which represents the country’s 83 000 physicians wants the Feds to put more than $4-billion in targeted funds into seniors’ care  home care  long-term care and catastrophic drug coverage there must be something in it for them do you not think?,?
10131,Bigots and racists.,?
10132,I love when you open your mouth and show how ignorant you are. Easy to quit? Your stupidity is astounding.,?
10133,The slimeball Kings of FAKE NEWS are at it again. If I were President Trump  I would ban these lying liberal a-holes from all White House access.,?
10134,I'm shocked this is the only thing he ever said that has any value  But he still won't succeed in doing a thing about it  Now when you say that Mosque who preached death to Jews and Trudeau hasn't done a thing about it HE SURE AS HELL HAS !  He's allowing more Islamic's to come to this country  saying one thing and doing another. With Jews we don't have terrorists with Muslim's we have terrorists ! Impeach the man  and their whole government as it is a fraud   God is supposed to have put these men in government to achieve a specific agenda  Well hes put him in there for the dumb people who don't love the real God of love  That's idiots who don't believe in God. It's you dummies who would rather throw out the God of love and have the false God secretly know as the man of sin  as he walks around to day dressed in robs and and saying all kinds of blasphemous things against God. You will pay for what you are doing and only concerned about your little paradise. .,?
10135,I'd rather have resources spent ridding our United States of home grown   executive office encouraged white supremacist terrorists,?
10136,I think you should ask the democrats that question.... No one in their right mind would allow breaking the law as a new law.... A big part of their constituents are law breakers...,?
10137,Fool.,?
10138,The funny thing is  that I've never ever heard of a refrigerator exploding.,?
10139,First  it's Bucy. I'll assume that was an honest error. (by the way  what's your name?)  Second  we've cut the budget over a billion dollars in the last couple years. How low can we go? My understanding is that we have come to the point where every state position cut is going to result in a disproportionate number of private sector job losses. Not to mention the loss of important services and functions that only the government can and should provide. Our ferry service in Southeast is being seriously undermined resulting in less economic opportunity  for one example.   Finally  why isn't the government an employment service? The government exists for the benefit of...the people  right? As long as we are electing people who are representing us and not just the wealthy and powerful  why shouldn't government be employing us to work together for a better world?   The space program was a pretty good job creator.   I'm not against private enterprise I just believe in government enterprise too,?
10140,Take everything he owns!  Scum....,?
10141,One of the problems for many in accumulating a large enough kitty for retirement is the return on investment  and not the actual money socked away. I know people who have turned over retirement funds to an investment broker  but have seen actual returns below the rate of inflation.,?
10142,About time don took a little time off even if he's slumming  don't want to come off like that last slacker   wonder if he'll have time for a little golf or have to spend it all with his lawyers,?
10143,His intent was a revenge killing of white cops.  A black cop apparently was caught in the crossover.  Please don't try and sugar coat this.  This is simply black racism against whites.,?
10144,Especially in Alaska  where the character of independent action is still admired  the support by these Senators for Trump  someone who is demonstrably unfit for the office of POTUS  just because he's an 'R' can not be justified.  Period.,?
10145,"NATO (US) has no need of this number of German bases now that the forward operating bases are being moved right up to Russia's borders in Poland  Romania  the Baltics."  --  Thatcher endorses NATO bases in Poland  Romania and the Baltics  in light of the threat of Russian aggression against smaller border states and former  now freed  Soviet "republics".,?
10146,In fact the costs of cosmetic surgery and veterinary care  the two fields most closely related regular health care and not typically covered by insurance have being rising even faster  than the costs of regular medical care. So Rand Paul is completely full of shit.,?
10147,Let the court decide whether that point is moot or not.,?
10148,I thought "rouge" meant red? So  I was thinking Red River  Texas.,?
10149,Maybe some of them will kick in your front door  ransack your home  "accidentally"  shoot someone you love  kill your innocent dog  then get away scott  free.  Maybe then you'll get it. Maybe.,?
10150,Big Glenn  you've tried to make some interesting points about free speech  but let me give you some advice. If what you're trying to do is get people to think about what you're saying  you need to present your ideas in a better way. Telling someone to "Listen and listen good" makes you come across as the schoolyard bully and isn't likely to make anyone want to consider your points. The fact that you think people who disagree with you "are ISIS" could simply be due to the fact that you aren't making your points known in a way that's going to convince anyone.,?
10151,Reckless endangerment? These thug losers brought the damn gun to the house when they decided to pull off a home invasion. Who the F cares if these losers are charged with attempted murder? I don't want them on the street. Screw them! Maybe they should get jobs and earn their own damn money like the rest of do. Where the hell is the second suspect? WTF? If this guy won't talk  then add more charges! Like hindering the investigation and whatever else they can find. Extremely doubtful these 2 losers were caught committing their very first crime. Probably have a history of theft for several years.,?
10152,This story needs a careful edit to make sense of the numbers.  I had to re-read it a number of times to sort out exactly how small a sample the writer is working with  despite the huge numbers in the lead.,?
10153,Vance Joseph is a worse head coach then Josh McDaniel and that is sad. This homer looks like Dave Chappelle. And the way this team plays is almost as funny as DC. Like last year  as soon as the team got that first loss TS went cold. This season was f*cked after the Buffalo loss. Another fine TS performance.,?
10154,Again  typical hateful double standard clueless liberal!!  So what where you live!!  That doesn't mean you even came close to experiencing anything like what many hard working  taxpaying  law bidding blacks live with.  Because whether your hateful butt is in or leaves  the neighborhood  your not black!!  Get it clueless!! No you don't because you're all knowing  all feeling  etc  etc.  Pls don't point out individual cases of people you know behaving as responsible citizens.  They should  all of them!!  And your friend is right  it should be between them and Allah; but either you're clueless enough to believe the majority feels that way  or you're a liar??  See in Islam  lying is expected and accepted to further the spread of the religion.  Guess you base your life and ideals on that  with the BS you're peddling!!,?
10155,Let's hope these vandals don't cut their own hands.  Jerks!,?
10156,RR definitely a heavy boozer.. rum dumb...,?
10157,Show us a picture of these invaders? How about a prisoner or a body? A civilian who has interacted with them? Or maybe you should just quit the stupid lies.,?
10158,Don't be so silly - none of the twelve were "elected.",?
10159,in the first boxing match between Trump and Trudeau Justin will be shirtless will lose the match but at least some will swoon,?
10160,If Clinton had won this election and there was some proof of Russian tampering you can be sure Trump and his army of social misfits would have stormed the White House-but  because Trump won-he's saying "I don't believe this affected the outcome"--this presidency is going to be a complete "joke" but I just the hope that the damage this histrionic moron causes isn't irreperable,?
10161,ignorance and left wing bs are a threat to the world and reality  and you just proved it,?
10162,Yep  DOT reacts way too slow on these situations and should have contra-flowed one of the West bound Kalanianaole lanes earlier from Ainakoa.  The three West bound lanes of Kalanianaole were breezing along and the East bound traffic was starting to back up at the Koko head off ramp.  You would have thought they would have learned from the past January break and the Honolulu Marathon.,?
10163,Traitorous and beyond sheer idiocy  considering the policy change south of the border.The shiny pony entourage will be pushed out of power long before Trump leaves office 8 years from now!,?
10164,I am posting from my phone at work  but nice try! Also  you do realize that the mobile site is not pay to post yet  right? I wouldn't give 50 cents to read this rag  but exposing Liberal tolerance (intolerance) is a pastime I enjoy greatly. Once again  thank you for being the best thing that ever happened to the Republican Party! With every insult you show that Liberals are much closer to the Fascists you claim to abhor.,?
10165,Dont torture them just put a bullet in their head. Case closed.,?
10166,LibLisa needs to retire. Kissed up to NEA/AEA teacher union. Utterly disgusting! Are Alaska's student outcomes so great- NO! Teacher unions are responsible for such crappy outcomes for Alaskan children  families  AND University students! Oh  yes  the ASD choice immersion programs are good  some of the public schools are good  But how about for the poor  the immigrant  the unsafe schools-shouldn't parents have choices for their children's education? Good K-12 education in Alaska? Not at all! 18.75% graduation rate for students who experience disabilities- DISGRACEFUL! That's a BIG  FAT  F! Regular students- a graduation rate of 60%? That is a BIG  FAT  D!   PATHETIC!!! Don Young has always called out big fat liars  and gets re-elected for that ethical behavior. On the other hand  Lisa sends her boys to private DC schools and ignores Alaskan family choices  so   dump Liberal  rino Murkowski-time for her to retire  hasn't done zip for Alaska!,?
10167,Everyone wants to be the last cottage built on the lake.,?
10168,No President Trump did not say that.........you are not listening and what you wrote is "fake comments".  President Trump said while campaigning and now that he wanted to re-negotiate the NAFTA and he added  "I want to add one more "F" - North America Free FAIR    Trade Act".,?
10169,If you do the crime  you do the time.   No sympathy for him or family.  Losers.,?
10170,I don't care if they lose their money either. It couldn't happen to nicer people. But I am still allowed to express the opinion that they are being idiots falling for one of the most dangerous fallacies in economics and that this will come to bite them in the ass. In this regard I highly advise everybody to NOT invest in fossil fuel shares - it's a great way to lose your life savings very soon.  Now here's the clencher - if we actually wanted to - we could have 100% clean energy supply around the world in mmm  5 years  it's a far smaller project than going to the moon in 10 and we pulled THAT off. It will cost a fraction of that - and this one is guaranteed to be a profitable excercise so in the end the actual cost is negative.   And how convenient is it that  when we do that  the oil in existing locations will be able to supply our remaining needs for centuries to come - so no need to go ruin the arctic any further. By the time we run out  we won't be using it anymore.,?
10171,Ray says we need to build a wall. It is hard to find anyone with actual knowledge of either construction or immigration who thinks this is a reasonable option. Much like the TSA  or the current attempts at border control  a wall would cost an enormous amount and accomplish little.,?
10172,my god you are as usual a piece of liberal paid trash shore    living is as usual any excuse for more taxes over fiscal sanity   oh right you libs live by that plan!,?
10173,OMG somebody kill me please!,?
10174,Attaboy  demonstrate all that is wrong with the Church's thinking  in as few words as possible!,?
10175,Monsters - pure and simple. Disgusting.,?
10176,Trump is a mental midget compared to Soros. Soros has him pegged.,?
10177,For all those who keep harping on about how every terrorist is a Muslim  please educate yourselves by reading this FBI study that says 94% of recent terrorist attacks in the US were carried out by Non-Muslims:  https://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/terrorism-2002-2005  In fact  there were more terrorist attacks carried out by extremist Jewish people than by extremist Muslims.,?
10178,What a free nation. Lol. The people who voted yes to this dictatorial swine deserve every bit of misery coming to them.,?
10179,So are you for Trumps new slogan? Make America Grope Again? And clearly  America's culture of rape is okay with you?   Trump admits to sexual assaulting woman.  I think that is pretty darn bad.   And this isn't about the Clintons. Trump is the admitted sex offender.,?
10180,Not a single one of these restaurants is "new Portland." Pondo Kosmas was a well-loved fixture in two neighborhoods of Portland--including my own--and Sayler's has held this challenge for so many years that another generation of my family attempted its challenge in the '70s. I have  however  spent a lot more time at the somewhat "new Portland" Sudra in recent weeks  eating kale.,?
10181,Epigenetics and the link to homosexuality in males has current support.  New theories are always great but I am now sure how you would test or model it  but if you do I am all for it.  All the evidence helps end the stupidity of gays being disordered.,?
10182,This is refreshing just to watch! In my lifetime  I've never seen a political party implode like this republican party is right now. They are grasping at straws just to stay afloat! The democratic party isn't doing a lot better itself! People have just finally gotten angry over inaction on the part of those we trusted to do work for the people of this country. Our State legislators are in the same boat. Every time the majority shuns the minority  they turn their back on thousands of Alaskans. We finally got fed up with it and just need to clean the slate. There's not much difference in a war today or one a decade from now!,?
10183,okay ignorant sheep  repeat after me    I AM A SHEEP OF THE SCAM OF GW!! see loser as usual you never get it  the climate ALWAYS changes  yet NO ONE   not one scientist can PROVE mans carbon is causing it but you lunatics fall for this bs which is  about MONEY AND POWER over us..now get educated over your brain washing,?
10184,Need a citation regarding how Obama set race relations back. The real reason you say he did is because a black man got elected  and racist Republicans can't abide by this fact. Hi racist!,?
10185,I damn no one  they damn themselves.,?
10186,Bullshit.   Let's clear the fog right now. When you were making the city "financially stable" you laid off an entire background recruiting section because they wouldn't let you lay off the 30 officers you planned to eliminate because of push-back. You only held academies when you were campaigning  which you HAD to because officers were retiring early because of your awful administrative oversight of public safety. You forced the Gang Task Force to be eliminated and put a moratorium on related training  dropping SWAT is 1/2 of the staff it used to be. Burglary became a Patrol Officer job  not for Detectitives - eg: No Followup.   APD was purposely understaffed during your tenure - 408 officers dropped to 320. And you have the balls to take credit for our current uptick in employment. I'm so glad you're gone. I wish it had happened four years earlier. Now please go completely away.,?
10187,Sue that deplorable witch right into her grave. She's a piece of dog crap.,?
10188,While you're taking a "short kneel"  why don't you suck my very long you-know-what. Just suck it for the short time that you're disrespecting the flag.,?
10189,There's plenty of wrong-wingers out there that empathize with the refugee issues.  Don't be such a fool.,?
10190,And all the worst to you  "poorly educated " "s**t sandwich" eatin'  misogynistic  bigoted Breitbart astroturfers !,?

10195,Once again  Kathy Wynne is reproving that she is an economic imbecile.  Expansion of rent controls will NOT increase rental or properties for sale one bit.,?
10196,Particular information aplenty. Two  or perhaps three  different styles - hence my suggested numbers.,?
10197,The hottest it's ever been for MORONS! Climate change is an enslavement scheme for weak minded progressives  liberal  and demo-rats.,?

10200,Feral cats do not belong in the wild  thus the term 'feral'. Kill them all.,?
10201,All politicians are liars and cheaters. When they are not kissing babies they are stealing their lollipops.,?
10202,Huh?  Pence hates America.  He is an obsequious lapdog for Trump.  What he stands for is deplorable.  In some ways   Pence is more dangerous that the phony and entertainer Trump.,?
10203,It was a great and gracious speech. He sounded very presidential. And to all the Hillary supporters don't worry. If 8 years of Obama did not destroy this country 4 or 8  years of Trump will not either. I had to admit when Obama won that it was the will of the people and now to be fair you must admit this also. The country is greater then any of it's elected officials  the presidency included.,?
10204,He will go down as the worst US president in history. Lets hope he gets impeached over the Russia issues before he does too much damage.,?
10205,Saw that.  Unfortunately  you can't retrain stupid.,?
10206,You citizens  who vote for the same people into office over and over again. These asme idiots are the ones who wastefuly spent this money on this genius idea to begin with. These people should be trown out of Alaska. Wake up people. New blood in office and maybe the corruption will be removed from our government.,?
10207,my god shore is that all you can do is cut and paste this idiotic post over and over on this  its been exposed as stupid already  stop making yourself look foolish any further  we are laughing already so much at you  we cant take much more!,?
10208,imagine riders from Ewa taking the rusted wheeled train all the way to ala moana - getting off  doing their shopping  getting back on the rusted wheeled train with all their packages - going back to Ewa. Why? they can just walk / bike to their mega shopping malls in their own neighborhood. Maintenance / low ridership / poor application / solution - excellent reflection of the Unions and Democrat party in Hawaii...,?
10209,Who knows what is in the mind of a crazed individual like the Grfiter and Liar in Chief?,?
10210,I remain appalled by this attitude. 11000 dead  so what? A trifle  too insignificant to be considered as a war effort at all  let's consider it a zero. Let's rewrite history that way.,?
10211,I'm all for Sharia law. Finally women will have to shut the hell up. I want to have multiple wives by which all I need to get one is trade a donkey. Trudeau bringing in all this scum from the middle east will be his downfall I say bring it. It's only going to cause violence and then the whole world will see how weak and stupid Canadians really are. Enjoy being the next Sweden. I'm moving to USA.,?
10212,Many will be unemployed and the state will suffer under HB 247 new Look at the Cook Inlet oil companies today  two drillers have gone bankrupt and APACHE the largest oil and gas lease owner in the basin left the state last month!!  What do you think will happen if HB 247 is made law? Alaska will go broke for a long time and the Trans Alaska Pipeline will shut down.  This will cause the state to lose 90% of it's funding and no wise oil companies will do any meaningful business with the state of Alaska because of it's bait and switch tactics that will harm it's reputation for decades!,?
10213,http://www.apfc.org/home/Content/dividend/dividendamounts.cfm Memory serves you right and $1000.00 seems reasonable for free money.,?
10214,I have seen  a little of the Punahou political underbelly.  They take their image  quite seriously  when their name is exposed to the general public.,?
10215,These machines were designed for speed.  Look at them  when the rider is in position  it looks like a human bullet going down the highway.  My condolences to the family and may others who think they need speed think twice before trying to hit 100 mph or more.,?
10216,My guess is it's likely North Korea will proceed with another missile test as they've done for the last several years.  Besides flexing our military muscle  the bigger question is will we strike NK if they conduct another test?  Hopefully not.,?
10217,Do you have any verdict-justifying remarks supporting the court outcomes that you'd like to share with the  VERY forgiving widow and children of her hit-and-run victim? James' comments tend to be wry and often on target - Yours just tend to be insulting and crude... I mean... in MY opinion.. :>),?
10218,Why are we not surprised that the democrats accepted a traitor.,?
10219,The Liberals keep promoting income sprinkling as the major change because it is the easiest sell to most unincorporated Canadians whose votes they are targeting. Also the new reasonableness test for sprinkling is likely going to lead to more small business owners paying themselves and family in salaries instead of dividends to avoid the test. Doing this will create tax sheltered rrsp room but also give the government more revenue in the form of cpp and ei contributions to help those programs stay more solvent in the long term. Public sector employees have legally been paying their fair share in taxes because they cannot incorporate and use these loopholes. Even the 1% in the public sector have been paying the new 33% federal tax bracket and higher provincial rates along with seeing their child benefits clawed back to zero. Many of the wealthy people using loopholes have experienced neither despite taking home similar or higher incomes to their public sector equivalents.,?
10220,Rape and sexual abuse has a long history in this country. We just elected a president that is quite proud of his participation in this tradition. Heck  rape was a profit center in the macro economics of race based slavery that financed the founding of the nation. Breeding slaves was cheaper than buying them and much more fun for the owners. That is why we have the 1 drop rule. Just because your white father raped your slave mother it would not make a child of a slave free by law.,?
10221,You got your facts crossed.  Either way Sword must go before he embarrasses any more!   The guy is an imbecile.,?
10222,But at least you are not angry over a politician. Thats what counts. Sheesh,?
10223," Just as no one is entitled to live here  no one is entitled to programs or services or support that can't be sustained (obviously not referring to CPP  which I gather is well funded)."  As you stated boomers are entitled to expect something like OAS which they funded for the previous generations  so before curtailing OAS the only ethical thing to do is to curtail programs that didn't exist for the boomers... perhaps the $500/child/month child benefit. Why aren't there people screaming about OAS also screaming just as loudly about programmes like this? Or money spent on immigrants in their first year.  Or money just being given away such as Trudeau having Canada make up for the entire $600M deficit of 3rd world abortions funding caused by the US withdrawing their share of the funding. Even people in favour of the program should realize that Canada picking up _all_ the slack for a nation 10 times our size was just political grandstanding.,?
10224,I am always amused when one part of a taxpayer supported governmental body (The State of Oregon) takes money from another taxpayer supported governmental body (Oregon State University) as a 'fine'.   Often that means that the organization levying the 'fine' gets to keep the 'fine' for its own bureaucrats.  Of course  there are never any consequences to the taxpayer supported bureaucrats who screwed up in the first place.  It's good to be a bureaucrat.,?
10225,With the unemployment rate in Denver at 2.4%- landscape workers are getting paid $15/hr  factory workers $16/hr and even "Good Times" the fast food joint is paying $10.50/hr to start  Amazon needs to raise its pay to at least $15/hr to find help.  Trust me  they have the $.,?
10226,His approval rating is in the 30's.  He doesn't even have his party  much less than being able to cross partisan lines and pick up decent support from the opposite party.  Should he ever be able to do that  only then would I be concerned about him  and big time.    A disaster like this may not be enough to maintain that acceptance.  And  I hope it doesn't.  But  should that guy get something like another 9/11...look out.  That'll rally the nation behind even the biggest idiots.  GW was a good example of that.,?
10227,Wow  some serious theories you have there.  China isn't that stupid to try to obliterate the U.S.  They don't take that same war-mongering approach that we do.  They know we're a huge consumer market and big money for them.  The way they operate is to expand their business and move in through opportunity.  They've never displayed the global colonization behavior that our country and Europe has...not even close.  Heck  if anything  they can just sit back and watch us destroy ourselves in the middle east.  Now we're poking at Russia.  Stupid...stupid...stupid.,?
10228,He should have been fired for stupidity and this was clearly a double standard.  Multiple Italian and German drivers have won the Indy 500  but there's been no mention of it by most Americans...but oh wait  the non-White enemy gets mentioned.,?
10229,What a bunch of morons.  Ok I understand if some misdemeanor person was in a halfway house for some petty garbage.  But an accused rapist with a history of charges and walkaways?  Yeah that's freaking bright.    Facepalm; here's when you have one hand that has absolutely no idea what the other hand is doing.  Why anyone with a violent felony conviction or charge would be sitting in a halfway house is just plain stupid.    Note "violent". I don't care if some fool wrote bad checks and ended up with a class c felony & is sitting in a halfway house.  Or any other non violent  non destructive felonies ... But attempted or otherwise rape  murder  arson  assault  burglary  etc  doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that you should keep them behind BARS!   Are you telling me that it would just be too much work  time and $ to figure this out before sending them there? Seriously?,?
10230,Why would multiple mutations be required for a selectable advantage? Why would it be improbable for multiple mutations to be present? You and I have 3 million or so different mutations causing differences between us. Many do nothing  some cause a little difference in our function... are you saying that for some reason creatures can hold millions of genetic differences  but it would be impossible for multiple differences to act in the same pathway? Or I should ask  why do you think it is possible for us to have millions of mutations but that having two acting together to create a larger difference is impossible?,?
10231,Since the question was for a resolution of a dichotomy of opinions by the bishops on something the Holy Father himself wrote on which deals with three of the seven sacraments and which entails the salvation of souls  which meets the Holy Father’s job description verbatim  suggesting they go back to theology school etc. etc. seems to miss the entire point of the question.,?
10232,the private campgrounds are often on land owned by neighbors of the fair  - renting out field for a few days a year  probably pick up a mess and pocket some nice money.  they can open their land to campers whenever they want.  they know people start wandering in a week ahead just to get a "good" spot.,?
10233,Canada's doctors are gutless. They should have had the moxy to speak up during the last election campaign  when Justin Trudeau was seducing all his star-struck young fans with promises of a pot-filled future.   What cowards they are.,?
10234,JM:  Did you read the article before your cut and paste?  You know that part where he said cuts are insufficient?  You are too quick to shoot the messenger while ignoring the message.,?
10235,You are an ass. Racism is real and systemic; it is not liberal or conservative  it is deep and affects everyone. The worst thing is that the POTUS  despite having the power to to heal and unify  is the person stoking the flames of division  discord  and hatred. He is a shameful and disgusting symbol of what is becoming "Not Great" about America  and athletes  by visiting or boycotting things  contribute to either the validation or criticism of Trump's behaviour. NO ONE is apolitical in this day and age. And your stats are appallingly incorrect. Do a little research before you further embarrass yourself.,?

10243,For a bit of clarification  the government booked a gain of $2.1B based on the increase from the book value when the shares were first acquired in 2009 vs. their sale price in 2015.

A vetting process that screens out extreme beliefs about women's rights  and a helpline for young women facing the prospect of FGM   is not "racist".,?

10252,Uhhhh  clearly you fail to understand Federal Law  Supreme Court Decisions  trump any state laws. .

10256,Probably the best reason is that those same Filipino vets were subject to decades of "broken promises and discriminatory treatment" (to use Ige's words) up until Congress and President Obama recognized their contributions to the war effort as noted in the article.  You'd be familiar with their situation had you followed this issue over the years  which many of us have.  Erecting this monument  like awarding them a Congressional medal  is largely symbolic rather than substantive.  But it corrects an injustice that goes clear back to the years of WW2  and as such has great meaning for the families of these veterans.,?
10257,A rise of $7 million is hardly an improvement for enterprise buddy. In the world of business that’s flatlining no two ways about it.  As far as licensing goes everyone expected that to improve.  Good was acquired cheap because it was losing money pal. You don’t address that but I can understand why  At Hoc? Don’t make me laugh.  Fact is if you take out the debt adjustment the company is running at a true loss. LOL!!!  They can’t make any money doing business no matter how much they’ve cut in the four years Chen has been there   Spin it anyway you want but the stock is going to start its descent in the coming days just like it has after every other earnings report release.

10261,This Pribus-Scaramucci kerfuffle is identical to the Trump-Sessions kerfuffle.  It's how Trump sends the MSM down yet another rabbit hole while creating drama that facilitates the actual objective:  routing the actual lawbreakers / leakers out.  Relax Newt.  This is how a New Yorker confronts a bully:  Walk right up to them and kick the straight in the balls.  I like it.,?

10266,Ambrose is too good for the party. That is why she could never be leader (except interim). It has become a party of right-wing extremist garbage. Moreover  would they actually have a woman as leader even if she was better?,?
10267,So...Scott free?,?
10268,That he said he was going to serve the regular people  not just the elites.  The democrats and Hillary forgot about the middle portion of America.  Trump reminded them that they are part of this country and that they matter.  That is enough for me to support him.,?
10269,Comey gave supporting evidence as to why he needed to be fired. He did not have the backbone to make the tough decisions. He was weak and not up to doing the job. On several occasions he had crystal clear memory  but on others he could not recall. Only when it served his purposes did he remember with clarity.  Nothing criminal came of today's testimony against Trump. It opens the door for a special prosecutor for Hillary's email server and how the AG actively interfered with that investigation.  Nothing burger with extra large fries for the MSM today. Trump was vindicated today on national TV again.,?
10270,not in all prisons and trust me  the guards can be in as much collusion as any inmate.  they HATE these people .it costs a fortune to house these people and all they do inside is learn more about computers and how NOT to get caught again  and they get tips and hints from their fellow pervs...,?
10271,Ah  liberals. Do they actually work and hold jobs? My workload doesn't afford me time to take off and constantly protest.,?
10272,Yes - You guessed it. Another activist "professor" from our beloved State University System. Complete with the Rip Van Winkle beard: http://liberalarts.oregonstate.edu/users/donald-brasted-maki I am sure he knows Kate is the LEAST likely to make any attempt to axe his Tier 1 benies.,?
10273,So  here we go.  This will pretty much finish-off what is left of the private sector economy in this country.  The underground economy will blossom - for a while.  Cash will be king - for a while.  Then  the government will eliminate cash - for our "own good"  of course.  Every transaction will then be electronic - traceable and taxable.  Then  it'll be the barter economy.  This is happening - right now - in India.,?
10274,A lot of people don't realize that corporations don't actually pay tax.  Their customers pay the tax.,?
10275,And furthermore  You lie  of course  but that's what you do  being an America hating traitor and all. I just wanted to laugh about your hero Hillary. All the names I call her are true  and now I can add PERVERT to the list. All her friends are perverts  and you loooove her  I'm just sayin'.,?

10285,I  intended  taking with me to the grave  my secret of repeated rape by a Milwaukee priest.    I  suffered symptoms of child sexual abuse. 6 yrs ago  Listecki filed bankruptcy.  Milwaukee is notorious for many pedoclergy like Fr. L Murphy who abused 200+ deaf kids.   Listecki asked victims to come forward  promising healing  resolution  fair compensation. . It took me a year to find the courage to come forward  I stupidly took him at his word  Listecki knew all along there would be no healing. He ruthlessly used healing as bait  to trick as many victims as possible to come forward as this was a cheap way to eliminate us all at once He then spent 5 yrs  + millions fighting us  saying not even one victim's claim was valid The result  the archdiocese kept 200+ mil in cash  did not sell 1 property  We learned Dolan had secretly paid the clergy that raped us  20k to quietly leave In bankruptcy most victims got much less than the men who raped us We are emotionally destroyed.  Is this Mercy?,?

10289,I think there is more to this story  but I LOVE THE IDEA OF BANISHMENT.   CAN WE EXPAND THIS SERVICE!   Look  we have Canada to act as a filter.   BANISHMENT is the answer to getting rid of Alaska's lowlife thieves and addicts.  Living in Alaska should be a privilege.   If you get caught as a thief or a violent offender  your ass should be banished from Alaska.  GONE.  Canada won't let felons drive through and we could easily screen them out at the airports.      Alaska has long been the dumping ground of pedophile priests and scumbags from all points south to "Start Fresh"   and some of them just started fresh at their scumbag actions.   We have a long and successful history of Banishment to draw from.   Blue ticket these violent offenders and thieves out of Alaska and even things up a little.   Screw up....go away.   Take Alaska back from criminals.,?
10290,Poor Papa Smurf. The Chumps cabinet is truly befitting its message of being a circus. What an assembly of odd and frankly ugly people.

10294,You're a fool or you're rich. Poor and middle class Alaskans depend far more on the permanent fund money as income than do the wealthy. Also  taking the dividend hurts only Alaskans. All of the non-residents who work in Alaska get to take their money home  free and clear and tax free. We need an income tax. That way everyone  pays what they can afford  including the non-residents who work here but take their money to their home state.,?

10305,I don't think anyone sees Trump as being perfect! He is not a disillusioned sneak like Obummer  wanting to change America into some preconceived idea that his race baiting socialist brain has contrived. The charges against Trump are suspicious at best  likely outright lies by women being bought by the Democrats crooked election machine. The idea that Trump is loud  outspoken  able to make a buck and doesn't cower down to the hard RIGHT makes him someone I will support - RATHER than a career criminal that has made it her life work to make herself 'rich & famous' Her lack of concern for Gays and Women in the countries she has accepted MILLIONS OF DOLLARS from should make women and Gays in America SICK!! She is a disgusting individual  likely very sick in the head.,?

10313,Yep and the time to sell is now. The real estate market is approaching a peak and there will never be a better time.  Another idea for the old lumber  mill that closed.  How about the city buy that and turn it into a marine storage with a couple docks for moorage and fishing on the river. A little park to boot  with a  boat launch?  Spend some money to make money. I don't know if that is legal but it certainly would make good use of that property.,?
10314,Does the Globe and Mail realize how Trump obsessed it has become?  Almost every article on it's front page are Trump related.  Doing the 24\7 never ending coverage on Canadians is about as meaningful as talking to the wall.  WE can't vote on any of it  there is nothing we can do and the election is even over.  We have our own idiot ruining our country.  Can we turn back our focus on things that we have control over?,?

10321,I think if you did a little research you would mind that there was a lot more to the war between the North and South then simply slavery.,?
10322,I agree it is a strange notion. If we were to ask anything of bar staff and management it should be to not serve obviously drunk people. And although that is technically the law in BC I don't think it is enforced with much vigour. All one has to do is to go to a bar or club late on a Friday/Saturday night to see it isn't. They'll cut you off if you start bothering staff or other customers but other than that you can keep drinking until you pass out.,?

10325,Seriously   50 cent bullet  20 dollar pine box. no media coverage.  These individuals are not worth our time  and memorializing them with long trials and prison time is just stupid.

10328,It's very scary with the idiot. He didn't know that Israel is in the Middle East. With him packing the nuclear football hope he knows the difference between North and South Korea. If he gets confused hopes he doesn't chose the Chump tower because his thought process is defective. Like I've said eeny meeny miny  mo is definitely not an option.,?

10331,Damn drug addicts !!!,?
10332,Aloha Stan   Thank you for your always thoughtful comments.  Ironically  I actually am very willing to be critical when I don't agree with Caldwell.  However  when the comments go so far beyond reasonable criticism and into the realm of crazy conspiracy theory  it's hard to stand by and see them on what could be a very value-added forum otherwise.  Rational-irrationality is one of the worst symptoms of election season.  It's so hard to have a conversation about the merits once you wade through all the misinformation  personal attacks  and crazy put forward by some of these folks.  Maybe that's part of the strategy - keep us all from realizing Djou isn't offering anything more than blame - and often misdirected at that.  It's really too bad  because I would love a forum that has true conversation about the merits rather than just binary love/hate conversations about whomever we are supporting.  Mahalo for continuing to be that voice.,?
10333,Just curious here Chris  how many Khadr like cases have come up before ?,?

10336,Your handle wasn't enough moral posturing for you so you felt the need to call our closest neighbors animals?  Pathetic.,?
10337,This is a very racist statement.  You would be too much of a coward to say it to my face.  Yes -- you're a coward -- period.  And yes -- your president has done some weird thing to his skin and hair that makes him appear orange -- thus the orange dude!!,?
10338,It's pretty obvious a new system needs to be developed that isn't based on a SSN. And where this data isn't stored in databases but by the individuals like the microchips in CC.,?
10339,She's just another political piece of shit exploiting the fears of morons for her own support. As an athiest I hate everything about her and her radical Christian terrorist tactics,?
10340,It’s not enough to just report on headlines we can get for free on the CBC. You have to now have an editorial voice  with younger diverse columnists  and a focus on in-depth reporting and special features. Not to mention a clean premium website design. What you report has to have value for people to pay for it.,?
10341,Leftists are also psychopathic liars as well and they want you to believe they are victims when they are actually the enablers of the drug culture and they want the taxpayer to pay for their personal failures and drug addicted lifestyles.,?

10345,They require PTC on commuter rail  all other applications in the US at least when the A line opened had been retrofitted  we were the first agency to do it from the ground up.  I can't say whether or not other systems are being approved or not as I don't know of any other brand new systems being implemented/opened yet.    You would think that being from the ground up it would be better/easier but apparently not  hopefully they will be an open book to other agencies that will have to do implement this in the future.    Here's some really exciting reading on the matter!  https://www.fra.dot.gov/ptc  https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&sid=e6d522db02b2b7be91220df2f0f09de7&rgn=div5&view=text&node=49:4.1.1.1.30&idno=49#49:4.1.1.1.30.9,?
10346,"He slammed Barack Obama for playing too much golf but  on becoming president  started teeing it up even more frequently himself."   Did "you" expect anything else from this lying  cheating  defrauding sorry excuse for a human being?   The "man" / Trump is the worst the United  States has to offer  and that from a nation where racists  white supremacists and anti-Semites rule in many of the States.  Hell of a "job" Gents. Many people around the world kind of "forgot about it" when these lunatics ruled Texas and many of the southern States  kind of hard to hide the truth when the President of the US of A is one of the lunatics.  .,?
10347,He has a cross tattoo on his face. That will convince a judge that he's a fine upstanding citizen. I guess he could cover up the gang symbols for court. Seriously.... it's too bad that he can't get the death penalty twice... Once in each state.,?

10349,The $1200 limit and overall union/corp ban will limit bribes and cash for access  a good start.   But tax payers should not subsidizing any political campaigns not even by a cent.   Potential MLA's can win via their own merit  good character  principles  integrity  if an incumbent based on their successful efforts on behalf of constituents....  As a business event operator for whom the Beautiful BC brand is important to my companies brand as it is for many BC companies   and very much for moral reasons I have asked my NDP MLA to ban all sports/trophy/killing any animal of any species for fun.   I understand sustenance hunting but other species bears/deer killed for their antlers/cougars/elk all have the right to live their lives and not be killed for sport  to put their dead heads on a wall which to me is pretty creepy.     Sports hunting has no place in Beautiful BC  most tourists wish to take a photos anyways.,?
10350,You just want to kill children because of the sins of their parents Wyatt.,?
10351,I do not care how pathetic Brillo Head Wynne is I would vote for a goat over her.,?
10352,More laws are needed to ensure homeschooling is conducted in a way that meets state educational standards  period. This nonsense about letting people do what ever they want is absolute idiocy. Of course  looks who's controlling Alaska state laws. THE IDIOTS,?
10353,Almost 12 000 per employee to comply with federal regulation.. that's crazy. Obama was a job killer,?
10354,and another left wing cry baby spews the usual opinions of dumb based on his hate and fantasy   no facts of course.. since he has ALREADY accomplished promises in jobs! and not yet even in power!.   the us will be much better off now under trump than the loser obama    if making jobs and security for the usa is the goal trump is the man period,?
10355,I was afraid  very afraid of that. By this I mean that strong and frequent opinions might run in your family. 35 years after her passing  your grandmother still speaks though you. Again I'm seriously afraid to ask but do you have children?  :),?
10356,What is the current statute on the books as of this moment?  What would be the recommended sentence for a minor to sell or provide cannabis to another minor?,?
10357,Margaret Wente is journalism's worst nightmare. Always superficial  frequently pompous  and famous for plagiarism.,?
10358,The courts are. not the Liberal Party.,?
10359,They've all known and it makes my vomit just how much shit they've forced the poorest of the poor to eat in the name of a democracy that's the vilest shit.  Arsholes  Narcisistic  Criminals.,?
10360,When the biggest turd on the liberal swamp says this   wtf are we continuing the subject?,?
10361,'Near criminal irresponsibility...'  Almost hope he goes ahead with it.  A few more epic blunders and maybe he'll be unable to finish his term.  2019 still seems like a long way off.,?
10362,juris>  You are really silly with your little insults.  Just don't keep making things up in you deluded mind  be truthful for a change   Ha  ha  ha!!!!,?
10363,You are the one who is not reading. This is what he says now about the "extremist far right":  “I want to do some damage to the people who are propagating this kind of rubbish ” he said. “I want to hurt them  I want show what it’s like to actually live a lie and be on the receiving end of this sort of propaganda. I want to actually hurt them.”  He's STILL bitter and LIBERAL and mentally ill.,?
10364,And cue the predictable comments from...Rhyner?  Clearcut?  Lars?  Who'll be first  boys?,?
10365,Susie  you pathetic moron  show us proof that you and your uneducated rural ilk are "paying for their  and all other illegal aliens healthcare  food  education  etc..."  You can't  because "illegals" are a net positive in US society. Check out the AFB American Farm Bureau data sometime. And get an education  you poor  pathetic kook. You're an ugly person inside and out (and probably claim to be Christian as well  what a laugh).,?
10366,Allie still "liking" his own comments.  Pathetic.,?
10367,you are the most racist person on this comments section Allie. Are you proud of you self. Whats in you in will come out no matter what it cant be helped.,?
10368,Well  clearly - vividly - the senior officers of the company don't think that it's a long term investment.  See Tuesdays' (Aug 22nd) Insider Report. An almost unbelievable bail out by senior management.,?
10369,Now  only a very gullible  easily brainwashed person could believe such an absurd proposition  that those hundreds of screaming  bloodthirsty bigots at every Trump rally were "plants" from the opposition. Next  I imagine your revisionist history will claim those all-white rallies were racially and ethnically inclusive  and gullible fools will swallow that line of hogwash.  Why not just be politically incorrect  and shout out your bigotry and misogyny with pride! Let's clean up America! Jail the degenerates! Hang the corrupt B*%#! Hillary! Remember  Trump promised before everyone that if elected  Hillary is going to jail. Deny that  gullible bigoted fools.  And before you retort with your knee-jerk accusation of anger and hate  I will tell you this - I write this with nothing but cold contempt for the hypocritical self-righteous fools who were manipulated through their bigotry and anger to elect a person who holds his supporters in utter contempt.,?
10370,Trump may very well be a moron. Tillerson only is apologizing for possibly telling the truth. Trump says he is the greatest. But everyone knows he is a liar. Trump has a poor reputation and few accomplishments given his high status.,?
10371,I am tired of cowards. Cory Gardener is "studying" it because he doesn't have the balls to tell people that he   of course  intends to vote for it. He needs to man up and take a public stand if he is not craven.,?
10372,She's an attention whore just doing it for the publicity. Then again so is the DP for running this article. Great  now I've fallen into the trap as well.,?
10373,What a sad and dangerous time for America and the whole world. A bad man will never make a good president. This moron must go.,?
10374,As predicted.  I tried to tell people "He's not a real republican."  But what he is  I do not know.,?
10375,What else can he say after making the stupid mistake of drafting Lynch. Dumb move  and i find it hard to believe that the Broncos will go very far this year. Lucky if they make 8-8  too bad the defense will have to win games again.,?
10376,I have always thought she should be prosecuted. I voted for Johnson because Hillary is a criminal and Trump is a scumbag. A scumbag who duped 62 000 000 gullible Americans into voting for him using his "savvy business tactics" aka Lying.,?
10377,anyone who thinks things can never change for the better might as well go jump off a cliff and get it over with  working to improve things is the right goal  Trump may or may not succeed completely but it is already having a positive effect with jobs coming back.,?
10378,Lillard is a very good player.  He has his ups and downs just like any other player.  Some nights the ball just doesn't want to go in hoop.  He is always a positive guy and is a good influence on the other players  especially McCollum.  I hope he stays in Portland long term.   GO BLAZERS!,?
10379,"....building the false case that Iraq was behind the 9/11 attacks".  Perhaps the author might supply a link to Bush making such a statement. Otherwise I'll have to assume this is yet another fabrication about Bush.,?
10380,What is the state of academic freedom in these six countries? Burning brightly is it?,?
10381,Walking  cycling  DeBus and Zip Car would be more direct responses and more effective.  But of course it is so much easier to continue piloting the Land Galleon and fulminating on line...,?
10382,O'Leary is the Conservative equivalent of Michael Ignatieff. A part time Canadian who overestimates his appeal to we full timers.,?
10383,The way to beat Montreal is to force them outside along the perimeter and into the corners. Montreal's four (or five) centres are not playmakers  but more like grinders (ie Andrew Shaw  Steve Ott  Torrey Mitchell et al). Phil Danault is their #1 centre  a good player and decent acquisition  but a third line centre on many teams  second at best on a few. He's a three dressed up as a nine. Montreal's centres can't force a defence to hesitate  back off  give them space  allow a big nifty play. I figure Vigneault knows this  and  in game 1  Montreal was forced outside  much dump and chase  scramble  get some shots off. They did have their chances  and the game could have gone either way. But the blueprint is there for the Rangers to follow. Meet them at the neutral zone/ blueline  force them outside. Flipping over to the Leafs game  the first thing I saw was Tyler Bozak trying to storm up though the centre of the defensive zone. He almost made it. I thought: why can't we do this?,?
10384,Actually North Korea tested thier first nuclear weapon in 2006 during the W. Bush administration. W. labeled them part of a "axis of evil" with Iraq and Iran. He then invaded Iraq in 2003  but left Iran alone because they had nukes. The lesson was not lost on North Korea. They figured the best way to prevent to prevent "regime change" was for them to acquire their own nukes.,?
10385,I am not referring to how people view her. Her accent obviously provides an immediate and on-going reminder to where she resides permanently.  I was making a technical  legal distinction  that most overlook  and yet is a key part of the Canadian state.  I still remember being young  and watching her deplane on television for a visit  and the CBC broadcasters were going over various trivial points (it took a while for the plane to taxi to the terminal  etc.) and one question apparently was "does the Queen present a passport to a customs officer  etc?"  And (it may have even been Mansbridge) one the the CBC types specifically pointed out that they researched this  and while I cannot member the actual customs clearance answer  I do specifically remember them saying "Many Canadians do not realize this  but she is  and was born a Canadian citizen. This is part of being the Head of State".  I presume this extends to her descendants  and would also go for any country that has her as Monarch.,?
10386,My favourite bookstore died when the owner retired. I miss it terribly.  I miss the scent of old books.  I love the library but it just doesn't have that distinctive smell.,?
10387,Yeah  like that's NEVER happened right?   LOLOL,?
10388,critical reader is sapient.  Yes  Trump is viewed as very weak and immature.  His bluster and loud  cocky talk fool no one.,?
10389,Read it slowly. You completely miss the point  which is: why is it acceptable for Trump to waive immigration laws and create immigration laws out of thin air  as he has with Executive Order 13769  but unacceptable for Obama to create DACA? The Republicans are talking out of both sides of their mouths. Using the ignorant pejorative term "anchor baby" pretty well sums up your inability to understand the gross hypocrisy in the Trump/(some) Republicans' stance on DACA. DACA is a humane policy; Executive Order 13769 is a racist  bigoted policy.,?
10390,You people have lost all sense of self. No Canada 150? damn damn damn!,?
10391,No?  Sex with children is statutory rape. Plain and simple.  Maybe if we start saying THAT is what the priests are doing  someone will take it seriously.,?
10392,So the same Americans who elected Trump and whose judgement the world has questioned have made it know that they prefer Trudeau. It follows then  that they continue with bad judgement.,?
10393,Tillerson is the true Moron. Trump ( though a moron about 49% of the time) has better political instincts than Tillerson. He does not want to topple this regime and that makes him the smarter of the two. ANOTHER regime change??? No thanks.,?
10394,And a friend like Mad Bob to guide him on how to create a dictatorship? I wouldn't put anything past this heap of rubbish and his Indian mates.,?
10395,...per your delusions Schceeer nonsense!...,?
10396,But we're trying to mobilize the rest of the world against them.   Its difficult because Israel is our ally.   If we succeed in getting the world to cooperate on this  much more is possible. Hopefully someday we will have world government.  Only North Korea broadcast this information. Like Trump they want to negotiate. Maybe he's the only one that notices so he starts out by threatening them. Hopefully this isn't his endgame. At least it's not what the North Koreans expect.,?
10397,Economic libertarians are on the right. Social libertarians are on the left.,?
10398,or Hollywood.,?
10399,Red lights? When did they start that crap?,?
10400,Really  TCPete?  That Obama used a teleprompter  is that all you rightwingers got?,?
10401,Koreans are rude people in general.  I never met any nice Koreans  only rude ones.,?
10402,And your comment belies your ignorance of facts and presumptuousness..,?
10403,He had his hands up..He didn't mean to stab them..He just fell on those bigoted islamophobes with the knife.. eight times.  After all  those melanastically challenged racists deserved to be stabbed.  Muslims are the ultimate victims of terrorism!™ Just ask Fred.,?
10404,More negativity from the ADN losers. Trump won  hillary lost  get over it ADN and move on. What a sorry loser.,?
10405,WE USE HYDRO IDIOT.,?
10406,I served honorably with Edgar Rodriguez in Iraq in 2010.  He was my next door neighbor.  I can tell you from my perspective  knowing Rod  that he wouldn't have been so ignorant as to point a firearm at a cop of all people.  My theory and it's biased   because I hate police and have for a long time  is that he called the police to tell them this asshole was beating the shit out of his girlfriend and he  being a concealed weapons holder   waited outside for the police to arrive with his weapon and then when they arrived instead of deescalating the situation probably shouted "DROP THE GUN  DROP THE GUN~bam bam bam bam bam bam bam.  Seven shots.  Senseless.  The only conclusion I can come to is the fucking EPD dropped the ball again and shot another minority because that's what they do.  They are nothing but brutish punks who deserve every  bad thing that happens to them when they fuck up.  In this case I hope they fire the pieces of shit who must have "feared for their lives" .,?
10407,The only people who think this is a good idea are the people who thought of it :),?
10408,Liberals attempt to excoriate  Trump no matter what  and anyone familiar with CNN and MSNBC clearly understands that.,?
10409,And Americans wonder why they are seen as the worlds idiots.,?
10410,Trump is a tin pot dictator wannabe.  A president cannot force a civilian prosecution of anyone  but he's too much of an imbecile to realize that.  His incompetence is impossible to exaggerate.  Worst President Ever.  By a huge margin.,?
10411,I don't doubt sexism played a role in HRC's failed candidacy. But the bigger issue was that she ran a bad campaign against a very weak opponent; one of the two most reviled candidates ever to seek America's highest office (hint: she was the other one). I am glad she wrote her book though as it is not one that she could have written had she intended to stay in public life. Agree or disagree  HRC has provided some excellent discussion points.,?
10412,If Trudeau and Morneau are actually convinced to stand down on small business tax reform (they should; overhauling a tax structure decades in the making in just three months is irresponsible  whether you support the existing structure or not)  then what are their remaining levers?    Obviously the budget won't balance itself as Canada has the fastest growing economy in the G7 yet we they are forecasting $28B in red ink.   So  GST hike?  Large corporatation tax hike?  Investment dividends?  Spending review (Trudeau is seemingly incapable)?  $50B+ deficits during the next inevitable slowdown that 'we couldn't have possibly anticipated'?    Defeated in 2019 - YES!!,?
10413,I believe that you would want one of the best payers in the NFL promoting your car dealership unless he devalued himself by participating in this idiotic protest.,?
10414,If white men fart is that white privilege misogyny?,?
10415,Nobody should listen to anything Elizabeth Warren says.   She is a L O S E R!!,?
10416,So  they were third in line to the presidency.  Why did that entitle them to use military aircraft to fly to and from home  other than an Executive Order from President Bush?  John Boehner also was third in line  but he did not use military aircraft to fly to and from home  nor does current Speaker Paul Ryan.,?
10417,The National Enquirer....now that's a very liberal rag and a rag I hear that the little 'd' likes to read while sitting on the throne  tweeting.,?
10418,You cannot name one conservative who has been able to give a commencement address.  Res ipsa loquitur.  "...most persecuted and victimized group  ever."  is ridiculous.  The victims gulags and concentration camps would be strong contenders for that dubious distinction.,?
10419,To no-one's surprise  Godfather Trump has spurned more scandals in a few months that other presidents have in years.  I'm sure he will keep Sarah in copy for many more eventful months to come.,?
10420,As we all should know by now ... eating at McDonald's will kill you.,?
10421,Obamacare is government controlled and run health insurance system and there are many of us who would prefer a market based solution. Are there some provisions in Obamacare that work  yes absolutely and those could be implement. The reason for the repeal is the core which will allow Obamacare to progress to single payer needs to be removed and that can only be done with a full repeal. That government control  is the issue that allowed Sec Sibelius to go overboard with all of her rule and regulations. You do understand there were over 10 000 pages of new rules and regulations implement by Sec of HHS K Sibelius after Obamacare was passed. Those need to gone through one by one or completely repealed and start over.,?
10422,I guess the globe didn't like my comment relating the flames to a mafia. So much for freedom of speech.,?
10423,hmm.  It seems that this is bogus community moderation as the paid moderators seem to be reviewing and blocking comments as well.,?
10424,Cheap shot trash deflection by who "I think" is a paid Russian troll. Do you have any proof you're not because your record of comments is proof enough for any sentient being.,?
10425,Thanks moron.  Did you even read my whole response.  Congress (republicans) allocated $4.3 billion in the 2016 budget for exactly what the State Department did with the money.  The $4.3 billion was allocated to spend on economic development  climate  and other State Department initiatives.  In case you've been paying attention to politics  this is exactly how budgets work.  Republicans can put money in a budget without ever saying it's for Global Warming  but for State Department initiatives.  That way they can fool their dumber-than-dump MAGAphant voters and support what they know is real - Climate Change.  Only you and Fox News remain adamantly stupid on all these points.  Keep those posts coming  I just love making you guys look stupid.,?
10426,Fuck you and the orange buffoon,?
10427,So these clowns are paid by the government  our taxes.  They're using our money to push their ridiculous political agenda Drain that swamp!  Fire them    Surely these idiots can find a real criminal case worth their time,?
10428,I suggest you re-read the article as it details what the charges are against all three people referenced. Are reading comprehension skills truly dead???,?
10429,why don't we ban dummies in the government - trumpy will be the first along with his entire cabinent and staff.,?
10430,Typical Wohlforth  let's serve up a hit piece on a conservative politician just before the elections...let's see  is there any "new news or revelations"in this article that would have prompted it's writing or printing?  Thought not.  Just curious  were the bridges connecting the Florida Keys considered "bridges to nowhere" in their day?,?
10431,What a vile and repugnant comment,?
10432,Heck  she probably voted for Trump for that very reason. Trump doesn't care one way or another about gay issues  but he knows the religious conservatives who voted for him want something in return. Trump will throw gay people under the bus at the earliest opportunity -- for example  if Kennedy or Ginsburg dies.,?
10433,Haha  definitely white trash.,?
10434,nonsense ............... iPhones are not garbage  Your 'alternate facts' are garbage,?
10435,Plus Jared Kushner is now asking for pointers from his Dad on how to survive in a Federal Pen.,?
10436,People on the dark side are the biggest liars  cheats  war mongering  corrupt hypocrites on the planet. They always   always  are about their lack of power to control how everyone thinks and lash out with childish vulgar  insults. They are the polar opposite  of freedom of thought. If  you are right and Trump is satan that would mean God is coming soon. May your transition to the dark side be fully complete by then. Don't worry you've been 90% there all along. Hail to the chief.,?
10437,Agree 100%. The green dream itself  is killing us not the c02 emissions . We need a Trump clone to run for the conservatives in Canada . Oh wait maybe Kevin. O'Leary can take us down the Trump path.,?
10438,Good question! Why the hell aren't the other 2 adults that were in the ho8me being charged?? Such bullshit!! This woman is a monster and should NEVER be allowed anwhere children!!!! PERIOD!! She is a monster!! Omg this poor little boy! I would fucking kill this sick psycho bitch if it were my son!!,?
10439,Well said.  Jones revealed his ignorance and hate for Christianity to the entire galaxy.,?
10440,Village idiot 😁,?
10441,You are the bigot.  Your claims are flat out lies and disgusting.  Nenshi is an honourable man and you have no right to libel him with false claims.  Your post is unacceptable.,?
10442,You dirty racist son-of-a-gun hater how dare thou??  Probably a right winger aren't thou?  What  thumpin your bible while fingering your AR  eh?  You never  EVER  mention the color of the perpetrators skin!!   Wait-what  he looks Caucasian?  Carry on my friend.,?
10443,Baloney.  Nobody forced the city to do anything.  It is HART and the mayor's incompetence that resulted in them having to look at property taxes to pay for rail.   You are a liar.,?
10444,The President has a historic visit to Saudi Arabia to extend diplomacy and all you main media people can write about is this??!!!!! How pathetic!!!!!,?
10445,What a twit! He  Leitch and Bernier are just the ticket to give Trudeau a second term.,?
10446,The old saying was: "Political jokes are fine  unless they get elected."   A friend who was smarter than me used to say: "There are smart people and stupid people. There are people with ideas and people with no ideas. The most dangerous people are the idiots with ideas.",?
10447,Boo Hoo. You lie every time you open your mouth. You are a traitor who supports a traitor.,?
10448,Dang! Just when you think someone couldn't be any more stupid.,?
10449,Actually  a psychiatrist made an argument for Trump being mentally ill. Megalomania and sociopath were a couple of possibilities.,?
10450,I would  bet you my last nickel that this priest has done the DIRTY DEED..............,?
10451,Dumb and gullible is no way to go through life.,?
10452,Exactly what I was looking for someone to say! Sexual misconduct is such a vague term that can easily be sensationalized depending on the agenda one has.,?
10453,Oh  Puuleeze!!! Give me a break. How stupid are they going to go with the politically correct garbage? There is Only TWO sexes  and you are born what you are!  You can surgically mutilate your body and take hormones the rest of your life but that will not change your sex! Call me anything you want  but the facts are the facts!  And That's a Fact  Jack!,?
10454,Obviously only an idiot would fly a drone near a wild fire with all the helicopters... But so far only the Feds have banned drones over national parks from the way I understand it.,?
10455,Google "flash bang grenade demonstration" and watch the police video of them using them.  Tell me  what seems like a the most realistic cause of her wound after watching the video.,?
10456,This guy is incredibly dumb. He's going to be eaten alive in Los Angeles.,?
10457,It should also be mentioned in this article that the permanent fund made 1% last year  the average is 6.4%. That is already $2.5 Billion lost under the new management appointed by Walker. The fund somehow lost money on stocks when the market did well. We cannot take 5% every year when the fund is making 1% without renaiming it the 'Quickly Dwindling Fund'  Perhaps you can do your next column on the late great Governor Jay Hammond and why he set up the Permanent Fund Dividend.  The idea was to give Alaskans a stake in our revenue so that we would pay more attention to government run amock.  When they come for our PFD  he thought Alaskans would wake up and realize the government is out of control. He thought Alaskans would demand change.  The last thing Hammond would have wanted when we have a legislature of corrupt bastards giving our oil revenue away and coming for our PFD...would be to roll over and give it to them as suggested by this column.,?
10458,This is all self-inflicted. Trump and his administration have no idea what they are doing on the domestic front or on the international front. They are ignorant of history  diplomacy and protocols. Trump has committed obstruction of justice with Comey and new news shows that he approached two other Intelligence agency Directors to lie and dispute the FBI claim of collusion with Russia. Both Directors who are military men refused to follow Trump’s request. They are not beholden to the President. Plus they have taken military oaths and are subject to military discipline. Trump thinks this is Trump Inc. where he can do as he pleases. He’s on the road to impeachment. He has openly confessed to obstruction of justice. It’s only a matter of time.,?
10459,It's killing me for real,?
10460,If he could start with $1 million and turn it into even $1 billion  he would be doing better than all our last few Presidents  whose main purpose has been to spend on their fat cat buddies interests or on wars....or both.,?
10461,"And what do 12 year olds know anyway?"  Nothing but what they're told and that's the problem  they're being told racist garbage.,?

10463,"In their first meeting  Trudeau needs to sell Trump on NAFTA "  It will never happen.  Justin is incapable of doing this.,?
10464,You sure are an opinionated illiterate grouser. This country is not just made up of uneducated rubes whining about brown skinned people.,?
10465,How come "elite" is sometimes a good word  and sometimes bad? Who gets to choose?  What is an "all-star" sports team  or a Canadian Olympic Hockey team  if not elite? What about an elite surgery team  or an elite community choir  orchestra or band?  Yet someone seems to discern an elite social class that does not choose the label for themselves. Someone else gives it to them  and then tries to knock them down because of it.  What's with that?!  Whenever someone says "the elites" in this way  then someone else should shout out  "What do you mean by that?",?
10466,My answer is "silly" - your reply is not.  Got it.    What "words" did I ever write that were never spoken by you?  In other words - what the heck are you talking about?  What "phonied doctored intent" and "irrationally rebut" (whatever that means) are you referring to?    Are you actually nic?????,?
10467,Canadian governments lack imagination for boosting trade other than money laundering of super-wealthy immigrants and students. Bankers like McCallum have even been swallowed up whole  by chasing more VIPs.,?
10468,You are fucking asshole.,?
10469,Regardless as to whether you like guns  use guns and/or support their proliferation  Don Young is an unbelievable embarrassment to me as an Alaskan.  Him calling people mean  disrespectful and childish is comical.  The photos and videos of him sticking out his tongue on the floor are the first that come to mind.  The other thing would be the time I saw him at the salad bar at a Soldotna Rotary lunch.  What a f'n pig.,?
10470,Hang them. Let it be a lesson to those that do this.,?
10471,Amazing and beautiful!,?
10472,Buffet bought into GE when it was in the dumps in 2008/9...and his current holdings are a  (very rewarding) "repayment" from GE for $$ he lent them at that time. Not sure that he would be buying it at today's lofty PE. Look at a 20 year chart....happy retirement !,?
10473,Reu - Fabulous. She had a shit day. You made an asshole comment without the facts. She set the record straight and instead of owning your mistake and apologizing for your comment  you proceed to insult her further. Can you be any better of a human being? You're a total ass!

10486,Legislators are expected to behave ethically and represent the best interests of Alaska. Those in private industry represent themselves. Nothing new here.  Mike Hawker and Gary Stevens and others in the Legislative Council members did not represent Alaska according to Alaska law and basic ethics. Hawker set up the collusion  Stevens allowed it  and others voted in support of it. (I make no comment here about the second LIO.) Pfeffer and Acree unsurprisingly behaved like the business men that they are. Maybe they read "The Art of the Deal"?  The legislature should be honest brokers  honorable representatives and behave in ways that are beyond all reproach. So in this example  the legislators who allowed this are much more wrong than either Pfeffer and Acree.,?

10489,I am one of the generation that grew up watching Ali and his private good friend and on air nemesis  Howard Cosell.  Back in the day  of course  before pay per view events  when ALL of his Championship bouts were shown upon network television.  Ali lived the life HE wanted to live  expressed the way HE wanted to  and NEVER apologized for any of it  which made him a hero in mine own book  both during his boxing career and after  when he led the fight to help others.  I echo ExiledNorths' thoughts on his passing.  RIP.  And he led a MOST accomplished life!,?

10510,Duncster  I would suggest that due diligence would have seen OSFI acting 10 years ago  not at the obvious tail end of a housing boom. Also  history has patterns where it is driven by human behaviour - housing bubbles  for instance. Not sure I would use past bond yields as a guide to the future as the world economy will not likely see the same economic conditions as the past.,?

10512,Ethics and aesthetics are culture based. Culture is based on information. Information is what computers are designed to handle. It's only a matter of time  as soon as 2025 some say  others give  a more conservative estimate of 2050  before computers can handle beauty and truth more intelligently than people can. This will shatter the myth that there is something mystical about human intelligence that the concept of information can never contain. That will be a red letter day for the human race and it can't come soon enough as far as I'm concerned.,?

10514,An important event and a chance to discuss the possible futures of the SC. And some decent comments.

10515,"including raising the minimum age for the purchase of tobacco products to 21" Does it really matter what age they set for legal sale of cigarettes when there are no possession laws? The fact that youth can smoke openly in public with impunity implies that the product carries no risk.  If we want to reduce minors from tobacco use  we need to send a consistent message. The only provinces that prohibit possession of tobacco by minors are Nova Scotia (confiscation of the products) and Alberta (fine of not more than $100).  "As the police officer was writing the ticket  the 15-year-old passenger – the reason the car was stopped – hopped out of the car and lit her own cigarette. Legally. And the officer could do nothing about it. There is no law prohibiting a 15-year-old girl from smoking. It is only illegal to purchase or sell tobacco to anyone under 19 years of age.",?

10518,What absolute drivel. Obvious this person knows nothing about guns and just makes up stats. 33000/yr? Really? This year NY  Detroit  Chicago and LA had ~1250 total and 1/2 of those were suicides NOT homicides. If you parse that out that means 31000 people were killed in all the rural or urban areas total BS. In addition  We have the 10th largest gun owners/capita in the Nation. The paper work and "hoops" to jump through did not dissuade citizens  but the only Mental Health check is if you yourself checks the box on the form. Otherwise  thanks to the Dems  it is illegal for FBI or Police to find out you're being treated for mental illness! P.S. the cities with the most draconian gun laws have the highest number of shootings  because the bad guys know you are disarmed and they can get any illegal gun they want on the street. ATF has to declare war on illegal guns. We have to pass laws that allow family and friends to get mental patients seen and taken care of.,?
10519,Yeah  let's bring in another 'business' that needs massive tax breaks and subsidies paid for by public money.  If some other place is dumb enough to be extorted by Amazon  let them.  We sure don't need another drainpipe to throw more millions of public money down.  What idiocy.,?

10527,Well the TrumpMonkeys have made it clear that Hillary was the standard for prosecution. By their standard perjury must be a horrible offense compared to using an unsecure server right ? Sadly TrumpTard logic doesn't work that way. All they care about is keeping brown and black people out of the presidency. They don't believe birtherism except the truly stupid ones. They despise Obama because he's black. TrumpMonkeys are just too cowardly to admit it.,?
10528,I'll pass on the book  unless it absolutely blows people away  but he is right that "god" is dead.  He was never real.  The greatest con ever played on the weak-minded.  No critical thinker on the planet believes in religious garbage.  An objective ten year old can see through it with ease.,?
10529,If nothing else  actually completing a degree  whether it takes four years or six  and no matter which  Dean actually signs it (my undergraduate degree was actually signed by the Dean of the Law School  but that's another story)  it at least demonstrates enough character that a prospective employer knows you can complete a task.  The cultural benefits of the undergraduate courses I took in sociology  Arabic  political science  logic  philosophy  economics  accounting  history  writing  etc. has clearly given me a different world view than I would have had otherwise  but "the habits and inclinations of learning  leading to clear thinking  decision making  communicating  listening  and working hard when you have to to get things done"  I possessed from my military service prior to my arrival on campus.,?

10539,Ronald Reagan was and is one of my heroes.  Actually  having lived through his times  I do not agree that he left office reviled.  He was reviled throughout his presidency by the liberal intellectuals.  I remember at a talk given at Harvard by Nobel physicist N.  Bloembergen how the liberal audience snickered and laughed at how stupid Reagan was for thinking that we could have protection from ICBMs.  Dr. Bloembergen  who was not particularly political  took questions and quietly blew away the technical objections laughingly raised by the liberals showing that they the liberals rather than Reagan were stupid.,?

10542,The RG sets this up to be another cars vs bikes story by connecting the loss of a vehicle lane with the increase in a bike lane.  The implication is that motorists are giving up a lane JUST for bikes. The accidents speak for themselves. People who are against removing that hard turn at a point where cars from Agate join 30th which is then followed by a merge to single lane are just thinking only of themselves. This will save lives. Adding space for bikes will not really increase bike use. In fact  about 5 years ago the LCC student government wanted the addition of jersey barriers to protect bikes so more would ride. Cycling members of the Lane County Roads Advisory Committee convinced them that such barriers would be a potential danger to motorists  instead settling on two large signs warning drivers of bikes which we have today.,?
10543,Nope  Trump is the West's last chance.  Obama and the neoliberal globalists sold the US out to China  just like Justin Trudeau is trying to sell Canada out to China.  For example  Obama gave China everything China wanted on trade without getting anything in return (e.g.  effective sanctions on North Korea).    Trump is trying to reset the relationship between the US and China to one that's more equal  instead of constantly favouring China.  If Trump gets a full 8 years as President  he will Make America Great Again.  Bank on it.,?

10553,Any system that imposes categories of humanity on its residents will perpetuate divisiveness.  The Indian Act to this day is embraced by both sides  the Crown and First Nations  because it enshrines a category "Aboriginal Canadian" that is convenient and from that it imposes restrictions and benefits on that category.  Some readers appear to be envious of generous aboriginal benefits bestowed by the Crown (without thinking of the restrictions) while other readers are appalled at the cultural genocide and expropriation of aboriginal territory.  Bottom line  as long as Canada perpetuates the two categories of aboriginal and non-aboriginal amongst its residents  the different policy treatments between them guarantees resentment and even hatred.  Such is the way of our species.  Wouldn't it be nice if we could get buy in from both sides to drop the "us" and "them" categories enshrined in our old-fashioned Dominion?? Where's the reset button?,?

Since that time Hawaii has consistently ranked as the state with one of the lowest uninsured rates  usually hovering around 9 percent."  Ahh  you didn't finish it. ...."Which resulted in this state being ranked #1 in part time job workers and being amongst the LOWEST paid per hour employees."

10572,"Censor"?  Disagreement on a public forum is hardly 'censorship'!    Pointing out the barbarism of the Saudi government's following their sharia law and the number of beheadings that were done under that sharia law is merely a series of uncontroverted facts.  There are YouTube videos of some of those beheadings  of course.  Would it be 'censorship' for me to post one or more of those links?  How about this famous Adultery?   "Princess Mishaal bint Fahdwho was found guilty of adultery and was shot at the age of 19."  "Her lover   Khaledal-Sha'er Mulhallal  the nephew of Ali Hassan al-Shaer  the Saudi ambassador in Lebanon   after being forced to watch her execution  was beheaded with a sword by  it is believed  one of the princess's male relatives."

All such collectivists  NAZI's  KKK  Stalinists  Maoists advocate hate and murder of people who do not believe exactly as they do.

10584,Absolutely right.  Trump is a filthy bigot  a pathological liar  the most corrupt  incompetent and unstable president in history; but none of that gets Bush and his gang of liars and thieves off the hook.  They are war criminals; history will remember them that way.  Bush refused to cast his wars in religious terms; that does not excuse him for leading us into illegal  immoral wars -- and not paying for them.  But it does underscore that as bad as Bush was  our current president is worse in basic  fundamental ways. Two weeks ago  we learned some things about General Kelly we didn't know before. I am less confident than I was that he or the other generals can save the world from Trump  though I think they are trying. Trump has to be impeached (or removed under Sec. 4 of the 25th Amendment.) That won't happen as long as the majority of Republicans persist in their cowardice. God help us!,?

10590,John  You really think that Exxon would walk away from a project that COULD return $400 BILLION to the state? Keep in mind  the state only gets 12.5% of the gas as a royalty and about the same as production tax. So  that means the entire project would return $1.6 TRILLION in 25 years (400 is 25% of 1600).   What all of that means is that either WM produced a report based on bogus AGPA data to justify an uneconomic project  or Exxon has stopped caring if it makes money. I don't know  but I'm thinking the former is the correct conclusion and if Exxon has walked (no  run) away from this debacle  then we should be right behind them.,?
10591,The Emerson clan doesn't really have issues with discussing city business outside of the proper setting  what really concerns them is when someone recognizes their thirst for power and stands up to their bully tactics.  The only question now is how long will it take for everyone to recognize their reckless ambition and will it be too late.  On a completely different topic  I wasn't at the last council meeting but I've heard that Emerson clan underling  John Norby put his foot on a chair so Sharon could tie his shoes or rub his feet????? I'm getting this second hand so I'd love to hear from someone who was there for clarification. I've heard of bizarre behavior but this is beyond the pale.  I've been meaning to get back to attending council meetings but if this is the type of behavior that I'll have to be exposed to then I'll take a rain check.,?
10592,Are you paid to support climate deniers  a tiny fraction of scientists who are paid by corporations to cast doubt on what the vast majority of scientists know to be true?  That humans are responsible for increasing C02 emissions to the point that we have altered the climate?  You need to read Merchants of Doubt  and realize that the only scientists who deny human-caused climate change  what we are experiencing today  are not reputable  trained climate scientists --- they are likely paid by corporations to cast doubt.  They are members of the "Earth is Flat" club.,?

You could and would do it for a time to get what you want then  you would start again  simply out of habit. You can't change a stone into a cloud. Not without some serious outside force to make it happen. In the case of a stone  a massive explosion would be needed to vaporize it. Welcome to the naked truth..................This was the reply to me from a 2 time middle eastern war vet  on my inquiry about the turning of Anchorage into a sanctuary city and Homer as well. This answer is for all the libral assholes that are goimg to get people killed by the refugees they are letting flow into MY state without even taking a vote to see if WE THE PEOPLE want them here.

10599,Plenty of cases of bear spray having NO EFFECT. Same with a rifle round to the heart  and unless you're John Wick....i doubt you'll get a headshot/spine with all that adrenaline. If it wants you  it will get you. The best you can do is let your presence be known and hope any other protection you have is enough to deter the bear. We're in their element  handing out free bear spray won't help anyone and cost everyone. The injured bear will be more erratic at unpredictable to anyone it encounters  that is why it is necessary to find it and put it down.   The race organization whom set up the event should have considered more safety precautions. Such as using airhorns for people reaching summit and upon return; a group of 5+ people stationed at quarterly intervals along the course. No offense  but a "sweeper" and a medical person is too little of preparation. I have seen nature walks with greater planning and prepardness than this.

This story is crap  an hysterical attempt to run down even those non-citizens here legally. And  you are enabling that hysteria. Just where is your head  anonymous big mouth?

10657,Something doesn't smell right here.   Over the past years I've purchased a number of  1 year old vehicles.  Depending on the model  I've saved roughly 15-20% off of a discounted sale price for a new vehicle.    The dealership is making money on the transaction  I expect they paid the seller 20-25% less than the original sale price (BTW  this includes all costs and taxes to drive a new car off a lot).    Look at auto trader.  With very few exceptions  owners would not receive anything close to the trade-in values stated in this article.   Vehicles depreciate much quicker than these estimates.       My point is all drivers should stay away from 7 or 8 year loans.  Their vehicles' value is close to scrap at that time.,?
10658,That's an outright lie.  But it's not surprising that a man would say something stupid like that.,?

10679,Another clueless and uniformed decision by Donald Trump. You just can't fix "stupid". Maybe Trump should come to Colorado and talk to our president  like he did in the Virgin Islands. If he talked to their president  he should talk to ours too! It's only fair.,?

Seeing this name written  i'd be about 75% accurate. and 0% on his surname. And yes  I live in Toronto! it's nothing about being better... just exposure to other names... but i can say that i've been told by more than one hostess (anglo & Immigrants)  that getting the names are difficult and as most have two hosts or hostesses...   (from Pickle Barrel  Red Lobster  Swiss Chalet)... .,?
10685,Nice recitation of the Faux News talking points. Sorry  but the American public has a lot more faith in the honesty  integrity  and courage of James Comey  than they do of Donald Trump.  As for impeachment   you need 66 votes in the senate to convict. There will never be enough Republican votes to impeach Cheetoman.   That's OK. I don't want Pence to be president  and everyday that Trump is president it damages the GOP.,?
10686,Would you classify being on the sidewalk as 'stupid'? Article references 1 in 7 deaths being to people ON the sidewalk.   I think that suggests that while it's comforting to blame vulnerable users  we should be blaming distracted people operating a device that kills daily.,?
10687,Another example of the inexperience and naivete of Trudeau's government. You simply do not arrange a meeting of this importance without knowing in advance that there is a good chance of consensus. All the negotiating and horse-trading should have been done behind the scenes with the permanent staff beforehand. Expecting agreement in a one day meeting was a waste of everyone's time.,?

10690,3/3 It’s imperative to distinguish Pence’s responsibilities from those of the other three. Conway  Spicer and Sanders are all members of the president’s staff. He hired them to lie for him and to him; they knew that going in and they have all tried to fulfill that mandate  and they have sacrificed their reputations in the process; they will never fully rid themselves of the stench of Trump. Conway will be remembered in her obituary for “alternative facts” and Spicer will always be Melissa McCarthy driving the White House podium into the reporters in the briefing room. Sanders may be able to save her reputation if she bails now. But Pence is NOT a member of the president’s staff.  He’s an elected constitutional officer whose oath obliges him to support and defend the Constitution -- not the president.  Co-operating with the president in the attempt to deceive the people of the United States  and making excuses for him when he does  is not part of the job.,?

10693,Trudeau must be lining up for selfies in his yoga pants as we speak.... You now this is April Fools joke right? No idiot would go to ChequesRUS - STAN without good cause.  The real question is why? Look up the words "useful idiot" on google. It becomes clearer  Trust me.,?

10703,It's frustrating to hear all the FUD about EV's out there.  First off  Honda's hybrid system was the worst one out there technologically. The IMA system I thought wasn't the way to go for hybrids and based on most other manufacturers following Toyota's full hybrid system  the market seemed to agree. I've heard of Honda batteries failing  but people are still driving 10 year old plus Priuses.  For my Leaf  I may have to replace the battery after 8 years (the warranty is 8 years/160k for a certain level of degradation). In that time  I save over 32 oil changes (at one every 5000 km). At a cost of $50 each (which is pretty basic and doesn't include a lot of the other maintenance that they do)  there's $1600 of the $3 - 5 k I was quoted on a battery - and 8 years from now with the cost dropping  it may even be less).  With fuel and other maintenance savings  HOV land access  4 years of free overnight charging  I'll save more than enough to replace the battery a decade from now.,?
10704,Most sane people these days are "Democrat supporters." Reality is Democrat-supporting.,?
10705,I used you to prove a point and you bit.  The point is how easily simple comments can be taken the wrong way.   Your reaction is the way many of us feel when we are accused of being bigots (or in your words ignorant bigots) when we post the truth.  Why do you think I have no loyalty to the truth?   Is it because I do not share your belief in the global warming alarm?  Is it that I do not believe in the lie of evolution?   Or is it that I am not deluded by the liberal doctrine and refuse to be?,?
10706,Costco cashiers are under a lot of stress - can lead to rule-enforcing behavior  that seems curt or rude.   Nonetheless  not letting someone pay with a non-member card is a rule. There is no process for the cashier (or a low-level manager) to skirt the rules  no matter how well-intentioned.   I don't like that it's so unbending  but it comes from far above the people who live around you who work at your local store. And has nothing to do with Remembrance Day.,?

10709,Modern journalism. Emphasis on the word "Could" and without any substance or research on providing the uninformed with facts and figures  common bloviating is the new normal. The fact is that this country is swimming in natural gas and two new pipelines coming online combined with an inability to export LNG (market is already saturated with supply and the price to make it is about where the market is) along with a warmer than normal winter will actually DROP natural gas prices 30% or more. The US is the only market the Canadians have (the liberals preclude them from ever building LNG facilities on either coast) and the volumes they have to sell are enormous. The US has oil and natural gas for over 100 years and far beyond.,?

10715,Gary Carl didn't mention holding weapons manufacturers responsible for gun deaths.  Gary Carl referred to persons illegally selling firearms in violation of the law.  In fact  Car manufacturers have often been the object of lawsuits for dangerous shortcomings in their products that lead to injury or death.  So have other manufacturers of other products.  Without threat of legal action  manufacturers would  and have  made products that are dangerous even when properly used.  No one political faction claims a monopoly on reason.  Again  your anger has caused you to choose foolish language.  Speaking of reasonable  if you had left out the words "stupid" and "idiotic"  your message would seem more reasonable and have more appeal to others.,?

10727,A selfish move by an ignorant  narcissistic buffoon.   Trump only cares about making money without regard for consequences to the environment or human rights.   By kowtowing to his uniformed followers  as well as fossil fuel and business-first interests  he seems determined to drag our country back to the 19th century.   How embarrassing that we are in the company of countries such as syria and nicaragua.  Have any republican congressmen said anything in opposition to trump's actions?   I guess they are content to ride this moron all the way to the bottom.   How sad!!!,?

10729,This story: "She noted large economies such as China are moving aggressively to cut their greenhouse-gas emissions"  --- Is this more fake news?    China has a huge problem with toxic air pollution in big cities like Beijing. (You sometimes see pictures in the news with people there wearing surgical masks to cover their noses from the pollution).  In an attempt to reduce particulate matter in the air  China may substitute imported oil for domestic coal. That "aggressive" effort may slightly reduce greenhouse gas emissions as an unintended consequence of trying to reduce the amount of polluting particles in the air.,?
10730,Trump is your sanctuary from reality. He is one of the most ignorant humans on the planet.,?
10731,Could Trump be any more ingorant? Stupid? Delusional?   Probably. He seems determined to lower the bar on a daily basis. At this rate  the bar will end up in China (or maybe Russia)  having sunk through the the earth after meeting the ground.  After that  it'll be lost in space  like Trump's non-existent mind.,?
10732,Your friend is an idiot.  A lot of trappers are using Ar's because they are lightweight  reliable  accurate and carry enough ammo to work a trapline.

10738,The original discovery and claim was made by Cominco.  Its roving geologist told me years before they found a buyer that Cominco had determined that it could not be developed without excessive risk with then existing techniques and it would be sold.  Given that Pebble kept filing documents with the SEC that outlined what it plans  but refuses to propose a formal plan  it gets to avoid a formal proposal that reveals that there is no breakthrough which reduces the risk from the tailings.  If it can get past the EPA's action then it will get to use the tried and true argument that it has too much invested to be stopped.  All it will need to do is figure out a way to get funding from the AIDEA to improve chances of the State backing its play.,?

She might have to hire 2 or 3 assistants to keep up with the continuous ethics and conflict of interest breaches True-dough and Co. are racking up on a weekly basis.

10751,It does not matter and you don't get it. The Canadian Supreme Court has already ruled as I pointed out  and it does not matter what any lower court has to say. Try reading the entire judgement of Morguard Investments Ltd. v. De Savoye  which was then extended to n Beals v. Saldanha in external cases.  And please stop quoting lower court rulings they don;t matter. So guess what the decision has been made and Omie will lose  and so will Jihad Justin in 2019,?
10752,"Food and medical shortages have made life even more miserable for average Cubans  already deprived of basic political and economic freedoms."  The Castros certainly weren't angels but it's not all doom and gloom. Cubans never had basic political and economic freedoms under the Batista regime neither. And I would say that they are slightly better off today. Their health system has made Cuba the first nation to eliminate the transmission of HIV from mother to child  has a lower infant mortality rate than the U.S.  and has developed a lung cancer vaccine (Cimavax)where  thanks to recent improved relations  the U.S. was able to get access to. As for their poor economy  that's the blanket trade embargo. For those of us who travel to Cuba often (and not only the tourist resorts)   we do see that Cubans are poor  but they are not necessarily miserable (there are indeed  many complaints). People can be well-off and miserable too (like some Canadians I know).,?
10753,Thank you for pointing that out. I was just wondering if CNN or the Washington Post would research the dissertations of every other government official or everyone who is nominated or appointed to a government position in the interests of fairness and balance? Which brings up a question to my mind  is this going to become a requirement for any government position  everything written by a prospective government official be confirmed to be entirely original and not plagiarized from someone or somewhere. How far back in history do we go to determine that?,?

10757,The big dams feeding Cape Town are at 37% which means 621 389 ML (or excluding the last 10% 453 447 ML). Simple arithmetic tells us that even at 800 ML per day this is enough water for well over a year.   Yet we usually lose 673 524 ML from October to June  since 800 ML per day (which in previous years we used over that time) only comes to around 168 000 ML  meaning  loss to evaporation (or other use?) must be around 505 524 ML.   Let's say we use no water at all from now. The dams would  reach the last 10% in April 2018 (before the usual June turnaround) if the same evaporation occurred. Telling citizens "to save more" is simply disingenuous if we'd still run out of water while using nothing at all.,?

10763,It's a "teachable moment" Denver Post editorial board! You  and the reporter  Jennifer Brown  who "broke the story"- thus ruining Weld Central's reputation nationwide- are guilty of the the same thing as Manual's principal-not checking the facts. Is it possible that some in the Manual community  knowing the opposing team is named "The Rebels" saw this as an opportunity for promoting a cause?  Did the lopsided score of the game have anything to do with this 'racism"? Bottom line-your stories pitting a rural school against a city school  making the rural school defend itself against false accusations- have created more racial divisions.  Own it  apologize  and do it now.  Preferably with a front page headline.,?

10793,I can understand and sympathize with those grandparents who have been unfairly torn from their grandchildren  unable to spend time with them.  But let's not pretend that their are not also many cases and good reasons for a parent to withdraw access to grandparents as well.  As unfortunate as it is for those grandparents who have suffered such a loss  such a law can produce just as many wrongs as it can rights.  That being the case  I believe the law should have been left as is  with parents having the right to determine access to their children so long as they remain legitimate guardians to the child at hand.,?

10797,Are you an idiot? You failed to answer my questions.  So let me explain.  Taxes on health care drive up costs which drive up costs health insurance premiums.  Increased regulations do the same.  Going back to the Philippines  you are right. I have relatives that can not afford health care  but like everyone else in the world  they are responsible for themselves and their families.  No one else  including the government  is responsible for them. The idea of insurance makes care more affordable as you diversify costs.  Insurance markets break down when you begin to subsidize one persons rates at the expense of another’s.  If you disagree  feel free to start paying for my families health insurance. I’m happy to connect and you can send me the 16 000 dollars we are paying this year!,?

10800,Must have hit a nerve... Of course  P&Z perform heroically. For government to retain its position as one of Alaska's only two growth industries  a symbiotic relationship must be nurtured between government and real-estate industry . Problem seems to be that not everyone views government with the same reverence. People who have lives may want more out of life than two full-time jobs  one to pay for burgeoning government  and another simply to "get involved" just to prevent government from further metastasizing into their lives. The "getting involved" seems most likely to happen when the size  reach  and cost of government outweighs citizens' faith in it  and their ability or willingness to support it.  At that point  one may expect lots of "getting involved" toward a referendum imposing transparency and growth restriction on government.,?

10803,This is a balderdash non-issue & non-scandal Tories will latch onto in a failed attempt to inflate it into an real issue  which it isn't and won't become. Trudeau happens to be an ALLY of the current Alberta NDP gov't  supporting the Alberta Premier's pipeline policies  among other things. He has no reason to want to intentionally snub or insult the province he's currently allied with & supporting of on some important issues. The fact he immediately acknowledged it was an unintended error and apologized ENDED it as any kind of significant issue - except in the propaganda & talking points agenda of Tories. But in this case that's just predictable Tory loud tire spinning on the muddy road their party's currently mired in  politically. Spin on  Harperites.,?

No  we're just Americans who see cranky  perverted codgers as a threat to democracy and the freedom to protest. 99% of liberals stand in unison as the clown car of ultra-conservative fascists embrace hate  the KKK  racism  misogyny  and the disgusting behavior of the president  (grab em' by the pu**y).,?
10808,This clown is fleecing the American taxpayers.,?
10809,Let's talk about income sprinkling...  If you have a pension plan you can SPLIT it with your partner but if a small business owner/physician does it it's call SPRINKLING but the Liberals call it SPLITTING for pensions...interesting.  So if you have a pension valued at $40 000 and are retired at 55 after working for the government you can SPRINKLE/SPLIT you income with your partner so you're taxed at $20 000 each....not to mention that the actuarial value of this pension will cost you almost $1 000 000.  Good luck saving up for that with Gov Canada 10 year bonds paying 2% interest!  An what about couples that are divorced?  Did you know that alimony is a SPRINKLING thing too.  Yes  that's right.  A person earning $200 000 per year who has to pay alimony will be taxed at a rate of $100 000 per partner PLUS they get double the RRSP room!!  Maybe it's time we start looking at household income for ALL CANADIANS and stop allowing politicians to strategically buy votes with our money!,?

10825,"...no one has ever been able to explain how cash paid 50 years later redresses or corrects the wrongs.."  It cannot.

Think about that: get the money  but it is allocated for...(list of improvements  programs  and--perhaps--start-up funds for businesses or even relocation plans.)  Ooops.  More "social engineering" and you know where that gets us!  Instead  money into the hands of survivors.    As for "closure"?

10852,Spare us more of your annoying BS  please.  For the significant majority of the Chinese people  life is certainly not first world in regard to income  material goods  quality of life  etc.  For almost all of the Chinese people  life is certainly not first world in regard to fundamental freedoms such as free speech  freedom of assembly  free press and internet  freedom to choose those who govern them  etc.  etc.    You really should travel  read and think more before making your incredibly ignorant and misleading and moronic statements about Canada and other countries like China.,?

10858,$70000 per year compared to 10-20k for 'normal' students.  Of course the 10-20k has to be reduced to pay for students with additional costs already and we don't exactly have those figures.,?
10859,You do realize that the "Institute for Energy Research" was started by a former executive of Enron and provide "research" that denies the existence of climate change.  Just another think tank put forth as a non-profit research institute whose goal is to promote the carbon energy sector.  Your link did mention that Germany hopes to get 80% of its energy from clean renewables by 2050.  I don't understand why more oil and gas energy conglomerates don't dive full into the renewable sector so they can continue to compete and profit into the future.  Maybe they are?,?
10860,Dont let the door slap ur a$$ on the way out. These posers can leave and trump will find real americans to do the job.,?
10861,Trump boasted   "I Could Stand In the Middle Of Fifth Avenue And Shoot Somebody And I Wouldn't Lose Any Voters" Now he will probably boast  I could have sex with a married woman in the middle of Fifth Ave & I wouldn't lose any voters. Probably.  DT can do anything & get away with it with a group of deplorables  and some RCs among 'em!,?

10867,Who's one sided? Las Casas?  The genocide wrought upon Native America by the Spanish settlers is a matter of little historical debate. The Spanish arrived and within a generation or so the native population had been reduced by like 90%. Las Casas was there. He became famous for arguing against the genocide and atrocities.   You should claim him as one of your "white people who did good things" or something. He's not uncontroversial  but he was responsible for much of the positive change in attitudes toward Native America in Spanish America in his time.  The Sun Times op-ed you cite doesn't make the argument that the atrocities and genocide didn't happen  just that it was so much LARGER than Columbus that it's distracting to debate Columbus day as if he were responsible for all of it.,?

10873,When a terrorist who is Muslim screams "Allahu akbar" and commits his violence in the name of Islam  the lefties tell us the terrorist does not really represent Muslims and we must not assume that all Muslims are nasty.  Now here in this letter we have someone filled with hate claiming to represent Trump.  And Fukumoto then extends that to blame all Republicans.  So come on lefties  apply your same logic to this nutcase.  The fact that some idiot invokes the name of Trump does not mean all Trumpers are like this jerk  and certainly does not mean Republicans are like that.,?

10876,Sue Is up there running her business by herself.  I would also carry a Big gun daily  since normally there is no one assisting me doing the daily chores or setting up the rental 'cabins' before the hunters come in.  Her helpers that they have shown are her nephews or her grandson.  If she now thinks she should sue the filming persons who did not help her when she wrecked in the snowmobile crash  and she is also saying that they did not call for outside help till later on  then she should go for it.  I like her and her way of life is not mine.  You would think that the people who she actually works with  the pilots  the hunters  those are the ones who would tell you how she is  not a film crew and a director.,?

10882,Your article has failed to mention the single most important benefit lemon juice presents and that is to acidify your stomach so that you process food easier. As we get older our stomach acids are not as powerful as they used to be so drinking a little lemon juice kind of kick starts your system.  Apple cider vinegar is also very effective at doing this and is a little stronger the lemon juice. They both highly recommended by naturopaths . It's amazing how the main benefit is completely unknown to most people.,?

10930,"the current crew may be the best staff Trump can ever assemble." That could be  but that certainly doesn't mean they should be retained.

A clean sweep.  Of Trump  his cronies  and all those in congress who enabled him.,?
10931,It would be more polite to say "this person did something idiotic" and let the reader draw their own conclusion.  :),?
10932,Good reporting  Tom. I assume someone at the Conference pointed out that the standard criticism of Adam Smith is not to question the capacity for good when someone pursues their own self-interest  but to establish that pursuing one's self-interest has a greater capacity for evil. Using Smith  for example  one could argue that a corporation with higher profits actually does more good for more people than a non-profit corporation might  but it's also necessary to point out that the same corporation  subject to unrestrained market forces  is capable of ruining lives. I'm not sure that came up in Mr. Koch's presentation.,?

10943,Trump is a racist  …and a petty con man  …and a traitor. But back to the racist part. That's what attracted so many of his supporters. There is no longer any doubt that Mueller's office is investigating Trump for collusion with Russia and obstruction of justice in the Russia investigation  …it's just a matter of time now. Being rid of the racists in the White House will go a long ways to making all the other racists scurry back under their rocks where they belong.,?

10948,ORS  Under Obamacare everyone is supposed to have an insurance card or pay a fine to IRS.  Medicaid is free now to 30 million or so low income folks. Medicare is a different system  paid by workers and their employers.  You must have heard Bernie say overall healthcare costs will go down under Medicare for All.  Employers won't be taxed allowing more money to the workers.  Doctors and hospitals will still be private.  Only the private insurance companies will lose business although they still can sell Supplemental Medicare insurance for "Cadillac " healthcare to those who can afford the extra premiums. You'll be hearing a lot more of the details of Medicare for All  a single payer system working well in other developed countries. ORS  I still haven't heard from you explaining why Trumpcare is superior to Medicare for All or Obamacare? There's even talk that "Amnesty Don"  formerly known as "Build the Wall Don"  could flip over to Chuck and Nancy to support a single payer system.,?

10959,The Japanese internment camps were  given the circumstances of 1941  a reasonable and humane solution. If they had been left in the general population many would have likely suffered far worse consequences. It is easy to say tsk  tsk from 75 years away. You are not living in time when each week thousands of American families were being told their son  brother  husband  friend had died fighting the Japanese.   Comparing the Holocaust to the current situation with illegals just makes you sound like an idiot.   Why don't you focus your ire on Mexico? A nation ruled by a corrupt Oligarchy. That government's solution is to just like this child die.,?

"No  I don't support mental health services for elementary kids!" You would be a real jerk if you didn't  wouldn't you?   But this just shows what a low priority Baldy has for increasing student achievement outcomes. He's a therapist not an education expert.   How many years before 4J asks Baldy  like all of his predecessors   to move on down the road? I don't think Baldy is going to keep this one for long. Once he realizes that no one is buying his well-crafted line of Bull  he will suddenly find another "opportunity" somewhere else and he will be gone as quickly as he blew in here; just like they all do.,?

10979,Remember that there is very little truth in sentencing. His parole rights were not restricted. So with  one day of good time credit for every three days served and then being eligible for parole after serving only one third of his sentence  he will likely be released on probation in 15 years. Does that still sound too harsh for murdering a person. If he gets out of prison at age 34 he has a lot of life ahead of him. Unlike his victim.,?
10980,Commoner   From what I read the federal government does not exercise direct control over how the funds it put with the TF and only acts as a review board to see that it is spent on the purposes it was set aside for  which are support academic programs.  This is what I meant when I wrote that the government has a say in how the money is deployed.,?

Start by pushing some runs across early even if that means SAC bunts in the first inning (a la Clint Hurdle) but get some early run support for the young starters. Also like moving the rookie starters to the pen for a bit (Senzatela) to give them break to re-focus. A rotating rotation... might be worth a try since they do have a few candidates.,?

They were also surprised to learn that HRC conceded.  Google had listed Mr. Trump as the victor while NBC still had him at 244 electoral votes.  Maybe someone should explain the internetz to some of these older media outlets lol.,?

10996,Do you think the woman (who may have been driving her kids to grandma's house) coming around that corner he was passing in may have been someone's child  too?  I have no sympathy for the sociopathic cretin.,?
10997,Images of Lady Justice depict her as having a blindfold  a balance  and a sword.  The blindfold symbolises impartiality so if 4 courts have already ruled against Trump's travel ban why wouldn't the SCOTUS also rule against said travel ban?  If however the justices of the Supreme Court are ideologically biased then that exposes the SCOTUS as an extension of the political divide and diminishes the probity of the highest US court.,?
10998,The Trudeau's and Liberals overall are sucker punchers.,?
10999,Concept one looks like an apartment house.   Concept two has my vote with it's big sign.,?
11000,OMG.  The articles says that 'Murkowski voted yes as she felt the full senate deserved to vote on DeVos and in deference to the presidents selection as she has done with prior administrations.   Huh??  What a lie!   Does she think we forgot that she sided with the rest of the Republicans to prevent President Obamas selection for the Supreme Court from even having a hearing.  What a hypocrite!,?
11001,You do realize that the Anchorage Police officers are APD and NOT troopers don't you?  And they do patrol the whole Municipality or in the case of Girdwood  pay for Whittier PD to so.  Trooper coverage in Anchorage is way in the rear view mirror.  The Girdwood post is gone.,?
11002,Trump again  in a psychotic rage  wrote about a fictional event attributed to John Pershing.  Trump lied  of course  as he always does.  The event with the pig blood (a particularly idiotic thing to write  even for an imbecile like Trump) never happened.  He cannot stop lying.,?
11003,This coming from a guy named 'meek' and I did not capitalize that purposefully.  3 out of 105 as I understand it.  Listen to the other players on the team.  Buck up pussy and don't cut yourself on any paper edges.,?
11004,What's your problem globe  truth hurts? Kick that ndp to the curb. Down with socialism.,?
11005,Wow USCG! What a chicken crap excuse for a reason. You did the right thing for the wrong reason. Show some spine...,?
11006,What an ignorant comment. Our brains got larger because of a higher input of protein  which back then was animal based. Now you can get plenty of protein eating a vegan diet without even really trying. Educate yourself.,?
11007,trump is doing a better job then Hillary would  so Schatz you and all your democrats sewer rats should just go back to the sewer where you and the SA and others belong your just another sewer rat that does not know a single thing that would be good for this country.,?
11008,Yup! Stupid as flying from Vegas to Indianapolis to protest a football game to then fly to LA at the expense of the American taxpayer. If Obama did this  the Alt-Right would have called for his lynching.,?
11009,Only deadbeat Repubs.  She and her husband kicked butt for 25 years of wasteful Repub spending on nothing investigations.  Tell us about Deadbeat Trump and his golden showers.,?
11010,Cue the fan boys; just remember correlation isn't causation.  No mention of them (Alaska Policy Forum) by Jenkins but you can bet they'll chime in on the unions as well despite the fact all three of them were former government employees themselves.,?
11011,I'm always reminded of Sam Kineson when I read articles like this  and I paraphrase:  "Instead of giving food to impoverished nations we should give them U-Hauls.  So you can move!  Because you live in the desert!  You can't grow food there!"  It's a serious geo-political cluster-eff that I don't purport to understand  but the fact that people continue to have children in these countries  whereas in the US I waited to have kids until I could afford the very high costs associated with them  is puzzling.  Don't flame me for being ignorant  because if I think this  there are millions of others who think the same way.,?
11012,It begins with Trump  the malignant narcissist  who sits in the middle of his stench-filled  excrement-filled swamp that he swore he would drain.,?
11013,Ah the wheel predates me by a few generations but I collaborated on the professional big wood chainsaws along with more than a few fellow fallers over a 40 yr career here on the coast  if that helps my francophone friend,?
11014,You can be assured that they have a plan to stop BC Liberals like you from stealing from the rest of us.  They didn't share their plan with you because your phone was busy.,?
11015,The reason our choices were limited to Chump and Killary was because of money controlling politics. If money were not the driving force we might have had good choices instead of the two worst choices in history. Its like either having to die by cancer or aids. Either way you are still dead.,?
11016,I didn't object to it.  Heck  it proves my point about the main objection to homosexuality is that God is somehow made unhappy by people he created gay having gay sex.  Such a God would be an Ogre and God is not an Ogre.,?
11017,Another example of Air Canada stupidity. Even though the policy was reversed  it never should have happened. A slap in the face to our veterans and a knock on our history. Clearly a VP with s@#t for brains. She should be ashamed of herself. Embarrassing.,?
11018,What is "it"? You don't mean his own notes about his own conversations  do you? That would be silly.,?
11019,No I don't you can They want to beat you like a dog until your wallet falls out,?
11020,And do you really expect to see that info in his taxes to begin with? I'm not arguing your question  just simply stating the point and rationale of why would he document that to begin with?,?
11021,Some time ago  I suggested that your knowledge of computer science was nil. Your post here shows that I was right.  A Turing machine has nothing to do with artificial intelligence. Rather  it is more-or-less a generalized computer   The Turing Test determines if artificial intelligence has neen achieved. Basically  if you cannot tell if you are communicating with a human or with a computer when you are communicating with a computer  then you can say that artificial intelligence has been achieved. And it would be a major achievement.   Your ignorant sneer actually makes you look both arrogant and stupid.,?
11022,IMHO eight-time Hugo Award-winner Harlan Ellison's terminology which distinguishes "realfact" from "goodfact" is more accurate than "alt-fact".,?
11023,A general entry for the CIA in Wikipedia.......geez.  Now you've passed Weak and are approaching Pathetic.,?
11024,Don't even talk about crops selling drugs in Anchorage. What about all the  meth labs and dealers in Matanuska Valley. 130 000 is chump change compared to what method sellers make.,?
11025,I think the reality of the matter is that the deceased was born with a penis.  No matter how much I want to be a T-Rex  I simply can't be one and as a non-delusional person  I acknowledge that.,?
11026,Just because the Liberal actions don't equate with your political viewpoint doesn't mean they aren't planning properly.  How are they driving a wedge into the historical friendship with the Americans? Because you said so? Trudeau and Obama got along famously - Trudeau's strength is respectful collaboration and communication.   American companies have already been developing our resources which are part of the boom and bust cycle. They come in  hire people and drop them like flies when the profit margin dips. Their businesses strain our infrastructure  health and education resources during boom times. We have record numbers of abandoned wells!  Were you not living in Canada during the Harper administration? Did healthcare services improve during those 10 years of conservative management? The Liberals have had just over one year at the helm and have spent most of the last year trying to clean up the messes left behind.  If you aren't happy in Canada  feel free to move to America.,?
11027,Please  not the dullard Hanomansing.,?
11028,Like a commercial for Burger King: Order a Chris Hayes or Lawrence O’Donnell and get the two for one whopper deal. Or for those with a real hunger order your Rachel Mad-Cow for the daily double whopper deal.,?
11029,Ooops! Your ignorance is showing again. There were obviously many guests invited to the ceremony given for Malala and his wife is one of the guest but even worse the proper gesture for a man meeting an Islamic woman is a Salam which is why Mr Trudeau is holding his hand to his chest.,?
11030,disgusting shilling for clark here- everything from photo choice to slant of of article headline. NO MORE NEOLIBERAL HATRED OF LOCAL POPULATION! No more Clark and her goons!,?
11031,He must be ignoring how for decades  Judges have been acting like politicians as soon as they are on the bench. You know like Earl Warren  college friend of Obama  Derrick Watson and many others in between.,?
11032,Republicans are finally getting the point that the US is becoming less and less white by the day.  The timing of this action by Republicans - immediately after an anti-Trump thumping at the polls - suggests that they finally see the writing on the wall.  Trump is a failed president  imbecile and psychotic.  He must be removed from office as soon as possible.,?
11033,That was very respectful.,?
11034,His attorney's really are some of the lowest forms of humanity to go to bat for a worthless predator like this. There really does need to be capital punishment for pedophiles like this one  he is of no use to society.,?
11035,It's fun to point out the abuse and stupidity of local bureaucrats but ultimately it is the spineless voters who election after election vote idiots into office.,?
11036,JoeC: do you ever just speak to the topic? Which is trump. NOT Obama  NOT Trudeau - trump.  What has trump done so far? Except for making himself look an idiot? Try answering to the topic just once or twice.,?
11037,So why did Harper do it to the tune of $160 billion dollars?,?
11038,Typical lying Liberal.,?
11039,They are  but who are they accountable to? They need a president's council to oversee them.  Hawaii sports constantly gets screwed by "the governing body"!,?
11040,Mulroney was a corrupt PM and a disgrace to this country.,?
11041,The governor should veto the legislatures stupid proposal  and fix the PFD at $1500 or more.,?
11042,You'll have to forgive them for not knowing about that stuff. Back then the evening news didn't cover any of those stories. I can only assume it was because he was a democrat and Hollywood approved of him.,?
11043,I am so thankful this jerk never became our president  I only voted for him at the time because I liked his running mate.  He goes over to Europe and trashes our great president only because he knows he will never accomplish what President Trump has accomplished in seven short months.  Hopefully  he will be gone before long.  He's fast becoming the most hated man in the United States.,?
11044,Oh for damn sake! Just stop having Halloween! This way you won’t offend some super sensitive snowflakes!  I’ll keep Halloween my way at my house and screw the pathetics at the school.,?
11045,liam your an idiot,?
11046,How about you start reading news from unbiased news sources like the BBC and the NYT and the Washington Post instead of listening to that BS peddled by Fox News and then you wouldn't sound like an uneducated idiot,?
11047,Two new contestants for America's Dumbest Criminals.,?
11048,McCain is showing the true class that is bewildering to trump & his supporters.  He saved the GOP from itself  so far  by not supporting their latest stupidity on health care.,?
11049,Steve  you don't know anything about this issue so yes  you're ignorant. As for the rest of your comment  I've found it useless to respond to dumb rhetorical questions.,?
11050,Thanks for demonstrating that most people who brag about being frequent flyers are douchebags.,?
11051,Its the 1% protecting the 1% as Trudeau has already donated middle income Canadian taxpayer money to Bombardier and the Beaudoin clan,?
11052,Most countries will try to charm you so you will spend  money there to stimulate their economies. Only morons like Trump and his equally stupid border guards or custom officers try so hard to insult you and turn you away. Of course  security check is needed  but what they have been conducting are just acts of arrogance and humiliation.  I am waiting for the figures to come out that show the drop of tourist numbers and the decrease of revenue of the tourism industry.   Meanwhile  let's keep boycotting Trump and his thugs.,?
11053,Find things to do together. If you had a broken arm and could not open the mayo on your own would you expect and love her to help you ? Well help her  go for healthy walk together  find time to visit a new park every weekend and bike  hike and otherwise get moving. Work together shopping and preparing healthy meals. Hit the pool together once a week and do some underwater aerobics. The soak in the hot tub together  and enjoy the time you forgot to give each other recently.,?
11054,I heard AG Chin really hired an attorney from the mainland to handle the case but Chun takes all the tv time.   He's running for something.,?
11055,YOU ARE SO FULL OF SHIT......THE MORE HE ATTACKS PRESS..... THE MORE I LOVE HIM,?
11056,Those NFL who kneel  are the ones who are divisive  not supporting their Flag  and country and those who gave up their lives to defend it. Quit putting a spin on it  you bunch of leftist Liberals  You're mad as hell he no longer pays for abortion on demand and all the other deviant crap you Liberal Democrats are pushing for. You're immoral bunch of snowflakes.,?
11057,Mean spirited Vitriol? Where? This is war you idiot Half of ISIS is under 18 What is wrong with you people? Grow up or leave the tough stuff to those who can handle it. There are many safe spaces you can go hide in,?
11058,What does this idiot think of Antifa?,?
11059,Duterte is right.  Unfortunately the Islamic fundamental jihadists love to use civilians as shields.  Once you come under their control  your life is forfeit and they will use you for whatever purpose they deem  appropriate.  The Philippine military as such have no choice but to press forward to eliminate the Islamic fundamental jihadists.  As these animals do not show anyone mercy  they also do not deserve any either. If I was Duterte  I would  play the El Deguello song for them (No quarter).,?
11060,When you knee jerk cry white supremacist with no evidence beyond skin color  you are a racist. Pointing out that racism is not "defending white supremacists " you genius.  You've previously generously smeared people for border control as white supremacists  xenophobes  etc. Your simplistic groupthink is noted.,?
11061,You would have to be on drugs to have sex with Cosby.,?
11062,THIS is why that surplus was held back. Looking ahead  Berkowitz could see the storm clouds that were gathering: state budget a train wreck; gutting of revenue sharing from Juneau; elimination of the MLP dividend.  Notice he didn't mention Sully's multi-million-dollar botched SAP software project black hole. Unlike his predecessor  Ethan doesn't continually whine about the last administration as the source of all our cares and woes. He knows that finger-pointing doesn't feed the bulldog.  Good guy at the helm; lousy time to be Mayor of Anchorage.,?
11063,Globe has again no copy on a west coast game  this time Your Js out in LA.  Asleep at the switch  so posting on the hockey thread.  Cannot figure why Mr. Gibbons would be bunting in the 3rd inning of a game being played between 2 AL teams  weird.  I know his team is not hitting  but the 3rd inning  on the road  that is 100% definitely not the situation to be bunting  not with a minor league call-up pitching  whom you should figure is going to give up some runs at some point in the game.  That was just too stupid  and more proof that John Gibbons  sorry  missing something.,?
11064,Are you serious????  You haven't seen All the terrorist events in the last eight years.  Are you that stupid?!?!?!,?
11065,I'm pretty sure the NFL can find a computer and printer sitting around somewhere to "WRITE" the policy down should they pass it next week.,?
11066,Because bafoonery is far more tolerable to complete corruption.  Because Hillary will take this country into a direction that we will not be able to recover from. At worst Trump will offend a few people and say something brash.  The GOP will keep Trump in check. The DNC will lay down the red Carpet for Hillary.,?
11067,Can you say Wikileaks?  DNC corruption caused this behavior.,?
11068,Is anyone still foolish enough to believe Trump ?,?
11069,There is absolutely no need to explain or defend against his hate speech. Wasilla should be ashamed of itself for electing this knuckledragging moron.,?
11070,You actually read the commentary and still defend this lying   treasonous wanker? Lemme guess since its a woman candidate thats all you need. How politically correct.,?
11071,Boots: "Thank you Mayor"  Seriously?! For what? Certainly not for delivering rail "on time and on budget" and certainly not for watching out for struggling families. Just yesterday  he was proposing doubling the parking rates for surfers and family picnics to "pay for rail." While he and HART executives enjoy taxpayer subsidized parking and HART remains ensconced in their $150 000/MONTH luxury high rise office space.  I thought you were supposed to be against that sort of thing.  And thank goodness Fasi's mall train was never built or we'd be saddled with how we were going to tear it down.,?
11072,Use them to just stare at the Sun.. Their intended purpose. A nice orange ball.  Experiment with them on your camera. Very very long exposures. Make an artificial eclipse by occluding the Sun with a disc. Watch someone welding from a distance  since they will melt. Put them on a pet and train them to stare at the sun. Tell someone they are Xray glasses and they can look through clothes  and when they say they can't see anything convince them that they are Xray intolerant because of self-abuse. Wear them when sunbathing. Wear them upside down  and look like a dork. Use them when you burn stuff with a magnifying lens. Get large Fresnel lens and melt asphalt.  Sell them on eBay.,?
11073,You comment was idiotic  that's why I ignored it.,?
11074,Nationalism is the last refuge of a scoundrel  and fascist politicians are certainly scoundrels.,?
11075,The only thing clear here is that it's unfortunate this piece of trash survived. He should have gotten consecutive life terms for attempted murder.,?
11076,Then please  next time to go back to Ireland  take Trudeau with you. He folds in half and easily fits in the overhead bin.,?
11077,Jesus you guys are pathetic. Still trying to relitigate an argument you lost 2 weeks ago.   You people sure stick together when the integrity of the white race is called into question though   ill give you that.,?
11078,Because the CCPA always advocates the re-distribution of the national income pie  whereas the Fraser Inst. prefers to have policies that grow that pie first...,?
11079,The malignant narcissist  mentally deficient sociopath and textbook misogynist is laughing himself sick with this decision.,?
11080,Yep  black people. That is why they are uspet. Am y of those weirdoes gaslight the protesters  saying thst what they feel and protest are not real. It is what abusive people do to keep their significant others close.  I shade conservative  but I have zero problem with protest.  I wonder why these “red blooded Americans” support Trump who hates veterans and war heroes and is a draft dodger and a coward. I guess they are hypocrites and hopelessly stupid.,?
11081,LMAO. We didn't collude with Russia. We don't even know any Russians nor have we done any business with Russian. Well okay we met with some Russian but we didn't collude. Fine  we colluded with Russia but its not a crime. OH my f**king God.,?
11082,I wrote him and said quite the opposite as well. What a liar and a shill.,?
11083,Of course not one thing in your post bears on the article itself.,?
11084,You can't fix loser.,?
11085,you are saying that there is no coordination among the state  city and charitable organizations in dealing with the homeless?  where have you been?  don't you read the papers?  your statement is false.  go check the facts.,?
11086,You're the one making claims.  I called you on it.  You couldn't produce.  Just demagoguery and animus toward gay people.  You're muted.,?
11087,Once again  you miss the point.  Excessive wages  spending more than other provinces per capita.  SPENDING SPENDING SPENDING.   Lets begin with paying several billion to close coal generation power plants that still have useful life while China is building more that will produce more power than all of Canada.  3 billion in tax credits for 300 permanent jobs.  Try cutting some wages but at least not give them increases like the NDP have.   Your strategy is equivalent to paying someone to dig a ditch today and fill it in tomorrow.   There are many other alternatives than what you have suggested can you not see that. And the PC govt's lost their way and the NDP is digging the hole deeper.  When are you going to actually look at the operating data as I had suggested.  Sorry I guess that is beyond your understanding.  But then when you follow Krugman economics what can you expect   SPEND SPEND SPEND,?
11088,I have never been asked what European cheeses I would like imported!,?
11089,"It's the fact that he's stupid  incurious  incompetent and a racist."  I thought you were taking about Clinton and Obama since they both qualify for ALL of those statements.,?
11090,It's too bad you don't know what you're talking about. I mean  you sound so certain  but of course you're incorrect  as always. Sigh.   You can't fix stupid.,?
11091,Didn't ask You!,?
11092,How about all of those tenured DEMS in Congress start giving away their salaries and putting their $ where their mouth is?,?
11093,I get the point of your post  and normally might agree with the sentiment  had she not returned and assaulted another employee.,?
11094,That is absolutely bullshit! I'm pretty sure that when police officers interrogate a witness and get a confession that is enough! Who in their right mind would think that this would go on in a household for as long as it did without the wife knowing about it? Let alone  she admitted to assisting with drugging the girls in order to let her husband rape and molest them! This whole thing is disgusting! Not to mention he used to also work and is good family friends with Dr. Mackie who is no longer allowed to practice after the DEA busted him for being apart of an OxyContin ring.. She is just as sick as him to bring these girls into her home as a sex object for her husband! Fucking sick that the state would be willing to look over that.,?
11095,If you don't know where to begin  try a nice local bike shop like Wheelworks on W11th at Lawrence or  if you want to go upscale  Arriving by Bike will on Willamette will help you out. Lifecycles at Pearl and 17th is very good as well. If you think an e-bike may be just the ticket for you  there's an entire shop dedicated to just e-bikes (Eugene Electric Bicycles) on High St near 5th (behind the building).  All of these shops are run by very nice people who know what they're doing and all are locally owned and operated.   If you are going to do the walking thing  consider Baker Boots at four corners. Our sidewalks and bike paths aren't exactly sneaker-ready (unless you like walking in eight-inch puddles).,?
11096,Of course I was! You never did that before eh Kodiak Dude? C'mon man  the article was complete trash!!,?
11097,All true.  Oddly  not just a liar and a weak bully  Trump is just a terrible negotiator as we are seeing.,?
11098,I thought you were being sarcastic.,?
11099,Cool mon!  ~ Mi movin to de Caribbean and live apon mi yacht!,?
11100,Hi  Null (and void)  Is that the only reason you could find?   Search  search  search - there are others.,?
11101,If you think we don't already have "bathroom bills" just start making it a practice to go into the wrong one and see what happens. So  given that you have them and are going to continue to have them it's simply a matter of legal hygiene that you make it clear how they are going to be applied. The only thing "ridiculous" is Liz Wolfe's assertion that this ought not be done.,?
11102,Reduced speed  10 mph - until the floodwaters recede.,?
11103,The Warriors are doing the right thing:  Trump is so anti-American in his hateful and inaccurate rhetoric.  More people need to stand up to the wretched bully.,?
11104,This forum sucks. We have a proven racist as POTUS  his behavior over the past week plus is putting our country in jeopardy both globally and from within  and some of my comments towards that regard are being rejected. The latest rejection:  "In honor of bannon's departure  trump  miller and gorka all have their confederate and nazi flags at half-staff today.",?
11105,Trump picks up the nuclear "Football"  tomorrow at 9:00 am Oregon time.  He is then in control of 4 000 US nuclear weapons.  You had better hope that he is not really an 'idiot'.,?
11106,This whole concept of forfeiture by siezure an disbursement by law enforcement with out due process in a court of law is astounding! How long has this BS been going on.... No wonder the DEA and ATF and even our local and state police love this loophole... must be nice to cherry pick your victims and disburse the revenue accordingly. To serve and protect? REALLY? Time this stupid loop hole was closed Geez.....!,?
11107,Meltebeke used to live in Park View and built homes there.  I was googling Meltebeke Estates and nothing came up.  Regency Estates is off Willakenzie.   That's intolerable  sorry you have to deal with that.   I'd write letters and speak at the next public forum.  I moved to Park View 10 yrs ago and couldn't believe what was going on here every year.   Crazy!   My immediate neighbors never say boo about it and have lived here much longer.   Crazier!   I remember one night  an illegal had a malfunction mid-air and a bunch of fireballs scattered all over the place...several on my lawn.,?
11108,Wow. You are a horrible dog owner. Those "methods" are abusive and of course have no effect whatsoever.  Do you think a dog has the cognitive capacity to understand why you wired a dead chicken around it's neck? Good grief. You're dumber than your dogs.,?
11109,Trudeau is responsible for this mess because of his open arms messianic welcome to all and sundry. His pal George Soros must be delighted and will surely pat him on the back! The Sinclair crest (Trudeau's maternal side) is a COCK PROPER ... Perhaps it's a spoonerism!!!,?
11110,Loser!,?
11111,Hopefully the press is developing some balls.  Usually the press tends to be the yes men for the administration.  Hopefully the press is developing some independence as being connected to the Donald is a losing proposition.   Pathetic that the Donald has dominated the press for so long.,?
11112,Ashton - Why don't we ask all the attendees at the reception to resign.  After all they were in the same room as the Russian Ambassador and must also be guilty of collusion - can you hear how moronic you sound?,?
11113,mind blowing how stupid left wingers are on facts   what works is NOT OUR SYSTEM since its failing so many of us   killing so many with long waits and being told NO    this will pass the senate  get over it.  perhaps a few changes  but it will be done. get over it!   and no    there will not be more sick people  more dead people but there will be real choice and they can keep thier doctors! unlike the lies of obama care,?
11114,What is repellent to me is the disgusting way the Clintons bombed the Serbs and the laughable way Serbs were caricatured in the media (the first season of 24 is a prime example). Since Hillary is your gal  and since you believe she does not have a racist bone in her body  why does this not bother you?,?
11115,Tacky perhaps. But bringing it up does nothing to advance your argument.,?
11116,He probably checked the area out prior to the event  just need the camera where he entered...likely took the same path. No one does something like that without having done a dry-run. That and he is dressed in black  so its clear he planned this ahead of time. Either the reflective bag is by chance  or this fellow is an avid night-walker  suspended/revoked license. Definitely lives near-by if on foot. If his motive was anger due to noise because he lives so close  thats why he slashed 80 something tires. An aircraft tire isnt as thin as a car tire neither  so he may have even been employed by someone there as an A&P mechanic. Hope the judge throws the book at him  sick of vagrants and thieves running rampant in Alaska. Then start chain gang on an epic scale  make them mow  pick up garbage  sweep rocks  trim trees  patch asphalt. Send them through anchorage with bags and paint  clean this town with the degenerates (mandatory). Failure to comply = 10 yrs added to sentence.,?
11117,Misplaced passions? I think oil has misplaced it's responsibility using Alaska legislators for a blank check to float their companies. You have used your connections to undermine Alaskans future and sinking it into debt to you. At $870 million dollars a year. Granted our elected officials gave you the keys  but you are guilty of greed and and fraudulent representation.  You had idiot- cum- laude in office who couldn't pass up stroking of egos. I bet you laugh at them a lot.,?
11118,They will be singing  "I'm a Lumberjack  and I'm OK!",?
11119,These freaking donkeys all need to be removed from office. I'm so sick and tired of these lifelong politicians who all seem clueless and could never run their own business.   For all you people who marched against our president how about we all March to Honolulu hale and demand rail be stopped. Oh that's right you only like complaining against the president of the United States and do nothing against all the useless politicians in your own backyard.  Such hypocrites. Keep voting for those donkeys you fools,?
11120,Trump = Disaster,?
11121,So your belief is that all business owners are idiots who will price their goods where they can get the least possible sales and minimize profit.  Au contraire. Supply and demand predicts exactly the opposite of what you think. Moreover it is not some law of nature. Just a rule of thumb which mostly works if all else is equal and all market participants have perfect information.  Even then it's not hundred percent reliable. And all else is never equal. That's why empirical evidence trumps intuition in economics everytime.,?
11122,What is it with these sick cretins?  Why are there so many that do this!  Putrid  gross human anyway. Disgusting.,?
11123,So what does this mean? Employers are actually allowed to exercise their religious freedom?   Personally I would like to see all of my employees fixed because we all know what pregnancy does to the work rate. However that doesn't mean my beliefs should be forced on private business owners.,?
11124,Photo reminds me of someone doing the Village People "YMCA" dance.,?
11125,Impeach the moron ... NOW!,?
11126,from my research  every employee gets a fifty percent discount on tuition and it can be transferred to anydirect family member.  Since Taggert is talking about an athletic scholarship  it would be paid for by the athletic department....The Intercollegiate Athletic Department pays the tuition for scholarship athletes to the University's general fund........The best I can find  it looks like the general fund provides about 3% of the athletic funding.  You mention the sports venues and bond payments and maintenance......that's an intersting area.....I don't know where all that is billed or funded?  doe anyone have any info......where's Bill Harbaugh when you need him?  Hey  Bill   can you help us out here....  regards  Gary Crum,?
11127,It blows their minds.  The Metro thought only straight white Christians had such opinions of Islam.,?

11129,They are both deranged. Two deranged madmen playing chicken with our lives and safety and treasure. And DT's deplorable base loves it and encourages it.,?
11130,My parents took me to Ringling Bros. when i was a kid (under 7 I'd guess). I don't remember the show at all  but ended up with a poster that I had on my wall for several years. Now with kids about the same age  I wouldn't even consider taking them  and I'm pretty sure they would be upset about seeing animals doing acts like that. I'm not a vocal animal rights activist  just  a regular joe. Anecdotal for sure  but I strongly suspect I fairly represent their historical audience and that the owners are 100% correct about tastes changing being the reason they're out of business..,?
11131,wrong franky  but then again i don't go around babbling about it as if it makes one smarter. totally fkn ridiculous.,?
11132,the next thing Muslims will request to use the speakers and blast through out the days to all the Infidels  the non-believers. You know what happen if you put all these young people to pray 5 times a day  wasting their precious life? You have a bunch of lazy  dumb and hateful people. How many scientists or science breakthrough are from Muslim majority countries? Saudi? Yemen? Afghanistan?  If praying works  Afghanistan  Pakistan  Iran ... should be The BEST  Most Peaceful and Advance countries on earth. They are not. Religion is like masturbating  you do it in your private place and not disturbing other human being. WTF.,?
11133,When in doubt  shout "edited!"  "I had him take a polygraph  which he passed  which forever destroyed my faith in polygraphs. (Saying polygraph with a slight laugh)"  This is not edited. This sentence means that she knew full well that he raped a little girl but he passed a polygraph test.. And she laughs it off.  I think what trump said in these videos is really stupid.. but I'm not voting on who is the more politically correct.. Especially from something that happened over 10 years ago. I remember myself from 10 years ago. I woulda slapped that kid.,?
11134,Comparing someone that voted for trump as being a nazi is making the comparrision that if you vote for trump you are a racist and kill people ..   lets say this the. We dont serve anyone who voted for kirk you are KKK.. is that ok for you lex,?
11135,Yes  lucky us  Lazeelink.  Canada got some really great citizens for that reason.  And many more millions think they did the right thing.  We're not anti-American; we're anti some of the stupid things the US does.,?
11136,You don't retreat at all you just steam full speed ahead with your idiocy exposed for all to see.,?
11137,Kagan recused herself  therefor she didn't count. Scalia  Alito and Thomas disagreed on some of the arguments defined by the court  but otherwise concurred  though with separate opinions. You still can't explain how the court or the Obama administration overruled I-9 and E-verify. I don't believe the court did that. Also  now it's Trump's turn. The moron-in-chief probably doesn't know about I-9 forms or E-verify  and he certainly hasn't cracked down on employment of illegals. And Obama is still the toughest president on illegal immigration  by any measure. Trump is a jerk  and The Wall will be a very expensive white elephant  doing next to nothing to stop illegal entry. Thomas is a corrupt man with his hand out at every right-wing fundraiser  you know  for "speaking fees". He is a disgrace to the Supreme Court.,?
11138,When even Fox has an article about the un-Constitutional  sue threatening  wimp trump: http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/02/27/trump-wants-to-weaken-libel-laws-amid-feuds-with-reporters.html,?

11141,NOTTA??? Do you care to explain?,?
11142,obviously this asshole grouped and assaulted Taylor Swift. His actions are the only things that are preventing him from attaining a job elsewhere. Wow. This behavior cannot be excepted and I cant wait for the judge to award Taylor and make him pay all the lawyer fees.,?
11143,No  it's not Dante.  It's measuring what you can afford to pay for before actually spending.  Grade school concept  apparently lost on the mindless suckers who vote for more despite being able to pay for less.   The irony is that capitalist lenders own you.,?
11144,Your fear rules you. Idiot.,?

11147,"Before NATO and the U.S. started bombing Libya  the United Nations was preparing to bestow an award on Colonel Muammar Gaddafi  and the Libyan Jamahiriya  for its achievements in the area of human rights. That’s right–the same man  Colonel Muammar Gaddafi  that NATO and the United States have been telling us for months is a “brutal dictator ” was set to be given an award for his human rights record in Libya. How strange it is that the United Nations was set to bestow a human rights award on a “brutal dictator ” at the end of March." go howl elsewhere,?

11150,Silly Canadians. You account for 2% of global emissions  and by cutting that by 30% (if you are lucky) down to 1.4%  you think it will make any difference regarding global warming or climate change (or whatever you are calling it today).  Canada's population is the same as the two larger metro areas in China. China is still adding coal plants to keep up with electric demand.    Think about it.,?
11151,Don't worry.  Denver has an Advisory Board made up of citizens with no law enforcement experience to tell them how to do it.,?

11154,Well now Blizz be nice! Having to interpret and reinterpret "holy" text that's thousands of years old  written in archaic language(s)  by who knows how many different - I assume male - "prophets" is tough!! The words "birth control" may not be there in the literal sense - but more in spirit...if you know what I mean.,?
11155,One of your own   Degrasse-Tyson  who is most likely more qualified than you  believes in the Alien Seeding theory and the Universe is a Digital Simulation and we can't know anything about it because it is probably not real  so don't even go there with me about inconsistency - as I said trying to discuss things with you is a waste of time.  You are just as much of a pre-suppositionalist as I am  and that is what drives me crazy - I admit it  you don't. You are a hypocrite and irrational.,?
11156,We on the right don't expect leftists - I refuse to call you liberal - to do anything useful; you're parasites who cultivate other parasites as clients.    Don't worry  nobody I know will ever ask a leftist to do anything unless we're forced to re-institute the draft to combat the people you constantly try to cultivate to oppose the US.   Then  we'll ask you to die.,?
11157,stooooopid.  Kristof exposes his epic ignorance to the entire galaxy.,?
11158,Maybe we could find better ways of spending those tax dollars to help both business and citizens. I myself run a rather large business. My business taxes are relatively minor my personal taxes run higher than most people's yearly income. I'm also the one that assumes every ounce of risk. I'm the one up at 5am everyday and home well into the evening. I then get to watch most tax dollars get lost in beaurocracy and debt maintenance. I watch essential services squeezed to make room for more beaurocracy. The problem is neither business or personal tax payers  it's the way the government spends it. Maybe we could start by forcing politicians to sit in through summer and Christmas breaks without any additional pay. Maybe we could cut those golden pensions down to something a little more modest and on par with the citizens of the countries.  Until you change these spending practices you're either going to have citizens complaining about business tax or business leaving.,?
11159,Thank the Lord I don't live in Seattle.  I remember when Seattle was clean and beautiful  a nice place to take the family.  Now  you couldn't pay me to go there.  Gross  smells like pee and if you are not LGBT you are a racist.  Sad.,?

11163,The reality is Elway is an idiot.  He wasn't making that much money. We had no reason to not let him play out the season at $4.5. Period.,?
11164,hahahahahahaha...you get what you voted for  less government on economical issues like deregulation of the banks etc. no government mandated health care etc.. that is what you voted for now get ready to live with it.....I can never understand how people vote against their own interest...oh well,?
11165,Swamp coolers only work with low-ish humidity  and will increase humidity through evaporative cooling... not the best idea for mold issues in Hawaii.   But even simple ideas like insulation and bringing in the cool evening air inside a well-insulated building... then wait until it heats up enough to warrant opening windows around noon could work well for some schools.   Changes in the school summer schedule is a slam-dunk! But could be hard to implement  perhaps due to National Testing standards and dates?,?
11166,Your hate is bigger than your accomplishments!,?
11167,Interesting that you mention John Breckinridge  even though you misspell his name.  The town was named after him (in an attempt to get a post office)  but changed the spelling because they didn't want to honor a traitor.,?
11168,Actually  you assumed the author assumed everyone was like you.  In fact  the author assumed that people are literate  numerate and rational.  You fall short of all three criteria.,?
11169,The public system needs more resources. But what would be the incentive for more government spending? The Liberals just announced $60 billion over 20 years for technologically obsolete military equipment to great acclaim by armchair warriors. I suspect a similar announcement as a boost in support of our public health care system would not be received well by the suspicious critics of the current federal government.,?
11170,And you are stupidity like your Fuhrer likes them...,?
11171,Trump is a blustering idiot.  If he has been deterred from tweeting  voicing and making even more hawkish gestures  it's only because someone cornered him and forcibly "explained"  that one more stupid word from his bloviating pie hole might precipitate an actual war.    What kind of thoughtless  poor-me jerks voted for this moron? Oh  right: The kind that got their widdle feewings hurted by the big bad liberals.,?
11172,"“Now who do I blame?” he asked  pointing to the audience. “The people. A bunch of idiots following Pied Piper over the edge of the cliff. That's who I blame. They ought to know better than that."  Odd  I feel exactly the same way about you in your office.,?
11173,I would not consider these troublemakers "liberals" in any fashion; the actual liberals stayed at the peaceful protest.  For years Eugene's liberals have been plagued by these anarchists and other extremists who give liberals and Progressives  a bad name  and now that our nation faces a crisis of authoritarianism we need to make clear these fools do NOT speak for us.,?

11179,Humbug! This WH executive suite is occupied by an absolute farce President. Shame on Trump with disillusioned electorate. Our peaceful world will find no rest with this Ugly American seeking vengence is various dilomatic circles.,?
11180,This is not a fault of the BC Liberals. This dispute started over 35 years ago. All the Americans ever wanted was less Canadian lumber in their market  and all we wanted was to send them more. Not a fault of government  but rather a fault of the lumber industry.,?

11184,I mean  is this a real comment or what?,?
11185,Turn off the 'boob tube' and the blaring will stop. Put down the hooch and go do something productive and/or enjoyable(constant moaning about the state of the world accomplishes nothing).

11191,Those alternative facts are exactly why tRUMP will never release his tax returns. 1-he has not paid taxes in several years. 2-he is lying about his so called wealth  he doesn't have any where near as much as these fools that voted for him think he has.,?
11192,Russian troll alert,?
11193,My activity long says that this comment was deleted  but I can still see it.  "If the CBC says it  then it must be true"  Does anyone else see it?,?
11194,America elected a businessman.  What did you expect.  Politicians and businessman are really one in the same.  Business rules in America.  From Trump's point of view  "What's the big deal. Goes on all the time.  Get over it.",?
11195,Research mainly in other countries has found microwaves from cell towers that send signals to cell phones  WiFi  Smart TVs+ also harm pollinators & birds. But few mention it.  We should not permit 5G networks. One source told me 5G may be a final death knell for bees.   Can we buy organically grown flowers locally? Most clerks dont even know what neonicotinoid free or organic means! A Seattle woman grows 100 kinds of flowers organically. We need OG entrepreneurs here. Some Farmers Market vendors sell OG flowers. Ask if neonic free AND OG. Ask store managers to sell only neonic free flowers.  NW Coalition for Alternatives to Pesticides <pesticide.org> lists neonic free nurseries  a work in progress. Pls. support these.   NCAP & Beyond Toxics are to be applauded for working on these issues for decades. Pls. join and help both in their work to save pollinators  food  us. In A in Wonderland 1951 v. Alice exclaims:  in my world flowers have very VERY special powers! Buy organic ones please!,?
11196,Such a liar  indeed.,?
11197,I'm confused--marking a comment as "civil" gets you in trouble?,?
11198,Did the Denver Post ask how far left would Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg go?  Or Justice Sonia Sotomayor? Or Justice Elena Kagan?  The headline seems rather partisan  does it not?,?
11199,The vote is irrelevant. The very fact they are drafting and fast tracking this republican torpedo designed to limit constitutional rights is more than enough information to see the obvious - a power grab that reveals their personal intentions  not those of the people of Lane County.,?
11200,What ever happened to simply not being stupid? Period.,?
11201,Regardless of how many ballots were used no candidate received more than one vote.  That said  why did this judge decide to only take votes away cast on the Democrat ballot?  Did he know which ballot was counted first thereby necessarily voiding the second ballot cast which supports the basis of his decision?  How could he be so certain that only Westlake or Nageak should lose votes?  How many votes did he take away from the candidates on the Republican ballot?,?
11202,Kenney's ascension doesn't mean there isn't room for social progressives. It does mean fiscal conservatives will have the final say on whether we can afford existing or new socially 'progressive' programs.,?

11204,About a year ago I was in Seattle and had a check for $85 drawn on Wells Fargo.   I went to a Wells Fargo branch to cash it and they wanted to charge me $6 because I didn't have an account there.   I said but it's YOUR check!   She just looked at me like I was an idiot.,?

11207,Sorry  pete  but you are the one who has read my mind again and decided that I think uninformed means stupid.  Once again  that is your issue  not mine.  As I told you one of the last times we had this argument  my daughter is smarter than either of us and yet she is uninformed as a voter.  I refuse to let you determine what my words mean.,?
11208,Here's some  from 2010. Note that some specialties made more in some provinces than in the US. Doctor brain drain reversed American doctors head north in record numbers http://www.macleans.ca/general/doctor-brain-drain-reversed/,?

11212,Right: If the bishops really believe that homosexuals are not suited to priesthood  then they must begin an immediate and transparent purge.  But of course they don't believe it  not for a nanosecond; and most of them -- especially the most militant among them -- would not survive the purge. This is hypocrisy of the highest order.,?
11213,The fallacy of this "philosophy of laws" is that punitive laws have to be enforced  not by the law itself  but by a "justice system" in which courts typically play a major role.  And it is NOT the function of laws or legal systems to prescribe individual morality  as if "one size fits all.",?
11214,I always enjoy it when a liberal author insults more than half her audience with the headline. Yup  you Trump supporters are ignorant hicks who like cheese spray. Nothing like the sophisticated intellectuals that advocate a failed progressive agenda.,?
11215,its the pitch control you loose with a T-Tail at slow speeds and engine at idle . Yep the 9'ers and 27's had pitch issues !  at slow speeds . SLUGGISH! FRIGHTENING ! . Plus the 9'ers were under powered for Take off - even with a small load on board ! Runway eaters ! Scary too !,?

11217,Sorry hon. Tootsie roll 44 was kicked out years ago. Wrong number,?
11218,Agreed.  The space on this posting system would not allow that much content.  The idea needs to be ran thru the legislative counsel office to find other bugs.  But that requires 50 voter signatures to have them do it.  So the proposal would require at least that many early supporters before that step would be possible.  Care to join?,?
11219,What a load.  You Trump Chumps just do not have any idea how to deal with reality. You have terrible judgment and pick exceptionally idiotic  arrogant  "leaders."  Trump admitted he fired Comey to stop the Russia investigation.  Man is he stupid.,?

11224,I pretty much knew this was coming  and knowing that  I suppose it's partly my fault that it did.  I should have disengaged when you demonstrated your contempt for truth and facts.  You trade in filth  gossip  lies  conspiracy theories. What a miserable  filthy world you've created for yourself!,?
11225,Wow  words like fraud  guarantee  will not happen  sounds like you've got it all figured out......NOT! maybe you should educate yourself before posting such ridiculousness!,?
11226,He was never told?? It was his job as head honcho to ask  pound on the desk and demand to know what is going on. How do these morons get promoted into these positions anyway?   Oh  yea  the "swamp" extends out to the hinterlands.,?
11227,Do white people march in the streets when violent white offenders are killed by the police?  Calling for the death of police officers because violent black offenders resist arrest violently and are shot because of it?  Disgusting.,?
11228,During his career in the construction industry  President Donnie employed tens of thousands. His employees were diverse. Many lefties talk and talk about diversity  but the  President actually enacted it. How many payrolls did Pretty Boy meet before becoming a politician?  You know what President Donnie is going to tell the people who will meet Trudeau on Monday? Here it is: "Whatever this clown says or does  don't LAUGH! I've taken enough heat this month.",?

11232,You cannot keep people imprisoned indefinitely for something that they may not even have done! Nor is it reasonable to have people waiting for long periods to get resolution - that applies to the accused  the victim and friends and family of both. The system has to work faster and if it doesn't then people will have their cases stayed as there is no reasonable alternative.,?
11233,angelo_vancouver.  Amen  I could not have said it better.,?
11234,There is very little if anything in this for Canada or Alberta. It bothers me to get the sense of so many people kowtowing to US hegemonic bullying. Several years ago  BC demanded a share of pipeline profits from Alberta  to offset the risk to their province and environment. The response was outrage and stone-walling  not to mention a lot of griping and name-calling.  Now the US is demanding the same thing  and nobody has the courage to flip their middle finger at Trump and tell his to stuff this deal. For my money we'd be better off waiting four years or less till he's gone and negotiating it then. Even having no deal then would be better than what's on the table right now.  Anyway  TransCanada will do as it pleases  but it will sure be annoying if the US bargains more in their tariffs than what Albertans are getting in royalties for our resources.,?

11237,You do realize we are not the only country dumping emissions into the air from oil field operations  yes? The EPA isn't everyone else's cop in that regard.  I agree some stuff coming out of the EPA is stupid  but not all of it (former hazwoper).,?
11238,She has written numerous books and articles. Its fair to say everyone knows what sort of garbage Anne Coulter has to say.,?
11239,it wasn't me  sleeping in today  no "love messages" this morning!  Aug. 1 is getting close for traditional hunting season is close! The vehicle in the Goodman Unit that had the special one on the roof with high power rifle  maybe mount that 50 cal up there.,?
11240,This is a result of governments that cannot control spending.   The money is there and no infrastructure bank would be needed if political "capital" was injected into the equation.    We are being duped.  The banks see blood and these politicians are more than happy to appease their friends with Canadians as collateral.,?
11241,It was vintage Trump and brilliant. The morons in the media have no idea how to attack Trump. He is just toying with the fools in the main stream Media (NSM) and again just toying with these fools. He (Trump)has outsmarted  them every step of the way. Trump  Trump  Trump baby!!!!!!,?
11242,Fools rushed in where wiser men would not tread. The state legislators who voted in favor are marked.,?
11243,Quite the contrary...by voting Liberal you got EXACTLY what you deserved.  As the old saying goes  you lie down with dogs you get up with fleas.,?
11244,Look into your ancestral lands today because slavery has existed in Africa for many centuries  and still continues in the current day in some countries.   Systems of servitude and slavery are common in parts of Africa  as they were in much of the ancient world.  The country where you are most likely to be enslaved is Mauritania. Although this vast West African nation has tried three times to outlaw slavery within its borders  it remains so common that it is nearly normal. The report estimates that four percent of Mauritania is enslaved – one out of every 25 people.,?
11245,stay tuned.  Just cause you don't believe it doesn't mean it ain't true.,?
11246,What does that mean?  They have columnists from every political party / belief.  That's what being centrist means.,?
11247,Gimme a break!  You guys are NOT nonpartisan.  Your liberal bias shows through in EVERY article.  Only a moron could read Civil Beat without being able to guess whether Civil Beat editors and reporters vote for Democrats or Republicans.  Why bother pretending?,?
11248,Am I missing a longer version of the article or something?  Where did Trudeau say he was looking for an idiot?,?
11249,I rest my case  but I have to ask of what treaty have you been harmed by like exactly.,?
11250,Having a big tent mean all folks may not agree at all times..yet the Clinton/Kaine ticket is strong and good..and Democrats will be keeping the White House and gaining Congressional seats. And Alaska is going to get a more balanced legislature.,?
11251,Spot-on article. The hypocrisy on the part of the Left is undeniable. But Republican congressional cowards never raise the issue  let alone object  but sit silent while Dems. run roughshod over them. This proves that Dems. are sadists and Repubs. are masochists.,?
11252,I hope the Liar in Chief enjoyed the taste of that shoe leather.,?

11257,Of course you will Roy! Like a good Liberal  you'll sit while others take care of business! Have a good evening!,?
11258,The problem with your theory in your erroneous analogy is that people who earn differently spend the same.  I guarantee you that someone making $100 000 isn't going to just spend $5 000  just like the person making $50 000 shouldn't be spending like they were making $100 000 (as your theory implies).  Do you see my point?       Regardless  here are the options:   1.  Do away with PFD and use that money to shore up the budget deficit.  2.  Sales tax:  Everyone pays based on what they spend  not how much they make  and the tourists get to contribute. 3.  Income tax:  Everyone who works pays on what they make.  This creates more of a burden on those who work  but it also taxes the oil workers who don't live in the state.     Which would YOU pick?  I think people need to contact their representatives and let them know.  After all  they should be representing us.,?
11259,Give a rest Eric...This is ridiculous.,?
11260,I agree with Dreamlost about non profits and taxes  especially churches.  The bloodbank won't get any more from me until they make all transactions public.,?

11262,No Mexicans are rapists and drug dealers?  Tell that to the thousands of women raped trying to cross the border  or to the infamous drug cartels that control large swaths of Mexico.  Words matter  precisely.  And Trump never said that *all* Mexicans are rapists and drug dealers.,?
11263,a smart phone in every students hand and free wifi. nothing else is needed except teachers that can teach kids how to use the apps available for free. my granddaughter goes to one of the best private fourth grades in hawaii and she is not allowed to have her phone on much less use it for class. ignorant adults = ignorant kids.,?
11264,Stop smoking dope and examine your racism dude.  The "illegals" aren't doing anything except working their asses off for shitty pay in jobs no-one else wants.  Did you lose your job picking fruit for piece- work pay  in the hot sun  with no where to go to the bathroom? No you probably lost it for failing a drug test.  BTW if Trump wins I guarantee weed won't remain legal.  The Republican party to which he belongs will make sure of that. He is so incompetent the Republicans will essentially run the show  just like Cheney did with George W.   He will build that wall over my dead body.  It isn't going to happen. Trump isn't running for dictator.  He is playing you for a tool  playing on your paranoid racist fears.,?
11265,Simply put government won the election  like in Ontario their is NO rational thought - just Public Unions  at the trough.   Yes this administration looks like a  piss soaked drunk stumbling down a path.   In one year this entitled suffer dude has taken more vacation time than Harper did in 9 year  carbon foot print   the middle class - what a joke!!!!!!  Pssssst Justin. we see you and you look foolish.,?
11266,Its really amazing how unintelligent most of the posts on this article are.  Its like the entire collection  of right wing bigots and racists have come out. Lets start with some facts. 1) At worst this man was a child soldier.  His father dragged him there and forced him to do the fathers bidding. 2) Child soldiers are not responsible for their actions because it is understood that they don't have free will and can not walk away. 3) The US was in violation of all laws regarding how they treated this man and most others at Gitmo. 4) He is a Canadian citizen and every other western nations brought their citizens home from Gitmo. 5) In the usual Canadian style   Canada and its officials aided and abetted the torture of this man.   Liberals and Conservatives are guilty of this.  Regardless of your politicals   your chosen leader can not choose what laws to obey and ignore. .  That means Stevie Harpo wasted $5 million.  Suck it up you fools. Next time vote smarter.,?

11270,In reality Trump lost the election  3 million more votes for Clinton  but the electoral college is a piece of undemocratic garbage that needs to be replaced with one vote  one person  count them all across the country.  If it's one country  the USA  with one president for all  then those 3 million votes make Clinton the president  but in the phoney democracy called the USA that has been so gerrymandered and manipulated by the right wing power elites it has become a joke.  Hang your head in shame America  you have never been great and probably never will be because of the right wing and especially because of the religious right wing.  And Trump is a dirtbag of the first order  way worse than Kennedy or Clinton and about a thousand times dumber  with a serious personality disorder to top it all off.   Trump will not last a year.,?

11288,Ailina  don't worry  because Roz Baker has determined cane smoke poses no health risks.  "I lived next to a cane field in Lahaina for many years. (Most of us in Lahaina would welcome back the sugar fields and the jobs and community help they provided.) Yes  it is a nuisance when the cane is burned but it fortunately it isn’t an everyday occurrence...." (Feb 2015 email)  Maybe this nuisance is why Baker required expensive  tax-payer funded cancer treatment. Spending most of her time on Oahu in recent years  Baker coukd care less about cane smoke health risks.   Roz has repeatedly refused to give hearings to address constituent concerns and state-level legislation about cane-burning  agro-toxins or open-air GMO production. She also took steps to ensure none of this would happen at the County level either.   See: http://mauicauses.org/roz-baker-says-exposure-to-cane-smoke-is-a-welcomed-nuisance-pesticide-drift-probably-too-tell-her-to-hear-sb793/,?

11297,"They ignore the beliefs and Culture and Way of the peoples opposed. This is called Cultural Racism."  Well then I guess that makes me a "cultural racist" lol.  Simply put  I think protesters  in general  are stupid.  I know there are exceptions and outliers  but broadly speaking this is mostly true.  The issue usually doesn't matter.  You can have a handful of smart people within a protest but the bulk of the crowd is going to be irrational and stupid.    Then it becomes a question of "why do I have to respect the views of stupid people?"  You would never tell me to respect the views of the KKK.  Nobody would ever tell me I couldn't make fun of them.  But why is it okay for me to make fun of some stupid protesters but not others?  What kind of standard are we using here?  Hawaiian culture isn't opposed to telescopes.  You're just making things up about Hawaiian culture.  Kamehameha would have leased the summit to TMT and executed all the protesters.  THAT is Hawaiian culture.,?

Comments from " spaghetti farmer" prove this hillbilly mentality of shooting first and thinking later is alive and well. Utterly stupid beyond imagination.,?
11308,A simple life  in Hawaii's past  was a happy time.  Making local people  unhappy with their lives  has caused too much trouble  within many local families.  In the old days  there was more sincere communication  with other people.  Everyone had to get along.  There was a communal style of living.  There was an extended family style of living.  Somewhere along the way  these became undesirable traits.  As technology came into play  old ways were deemed obsolete.  Now  the obsolete ways  are coming back.  The wheel has been reinvented.  A simple and happy life  is something that people strive for these days.,?

11313,Yep  and they own guns BECAUSE they are cowards. Hearing them spout off this nonsense about wanting to defend others is laughable. They never stand up for others. They cling to their guns because they are a) afraid and b) weak.,?

11318,Or low placed in life; if he doesn't have a job then he can't get job retaliation; if he does have a job then his opinion can be used against him at his place of employment this extends all the way to business owners as people can and do activate boycotts that have actually closed more than a few places down.   No one is immune from this.  Using your real name to post your rhetoric can get you in a barrel of trouble unless you're very careful about how and what you say.,?
11319,Bs  the people have spoken - respect the outcome!!!! Only a fool would state the Democrats and their globalist mentality didn't bring this on themselves. Dragging that tired old hag across the finish line by any means necessary was a revolting site that exposed their intentions -ooops!!! We are witnessing the modern day Cold War   the Marxist movement is being rejected on mass and the people are looking for a re-set. Sorry you don't approve!!!! Stay turned for the fire works  should make for great media even if they are in denial.,?
11320,What matters is if the sexual contact was consensual even though underage people cannot legally give consent. Your comment  Michael3  is worthless and vulgar. A person like you has no business making comments about sensitive topics such as sexuality  childhood and consent. You lack the intellect and emotional development and you are  in fact  a lowlife scumbag. The advice of a cretin is always superfluous.,?

11324,wonder if the new director was hired only because of his connections with the FTA just to convince the FTA to give hart and extension to file the new financial plans.  after all  just one year is surely not sufficient for the new director to make any meaningful changes to the work and new contracts.  he stated that he would not focus on the past but the future  but to know what happened and how things happened he would need to review the mistakes and problems of the past so that they are not repeated.   something smells.,?

11337,You are misinformed.  The CPC raised much more of its funding from ordinary Canadians contributing about $50 a head in response to mailers while the LPC raised its money with far fewer supporters giving much higher average contributions than did the supporters of either the CPC or the NDP.      Conservatives did hold fundraisers but they tended to be rather conservative affairs with typically one or two hundred bucks or less (not the maximum $1500 favoured by the Liberals) to attend. Rarely did PM Harper attend such events nor never were they secretly held and openly elitist and racial affairs in which a single race group of billionaire and multi-millionaire business tycoons peddled their propositions to the PM or cabinet members.  As well  none of such events were attended by tycoons with close ties and shared interests with the Communist Party and government of China.  If such events had been held  most Canadian conservatives including me would not have attended.    Keep pitching LOL,?

11340,Policy doesn't evolve in a vacuum.  The decisions impacting policy development reflect the values and perspective of those making the decisions.  Each and every action and comment made by Mr. Trump reflects his PERSONAL values and principles (or lack thereof).  To deny this is folly.  You present the perspective that the "occupant" of the office of the Presidency somehow ignores those personal perspectives and values in exercising the duties of the office.  In Mr. Trump's case nothing could be further than the reality of his Presidency.  Some  rather optimistically IMO  thought Mr. Trump would "rise" to the office.  Unfortunately  I think we've seen the opposite  he's dragged the office down to his level.  I find this very  very sad for our country and the entire world.  Gary crum,?

BS about Faye Stewart's remarks about Vietnamese refugees ... BS about "rights" of activists being jailed after protesting ... $60 for anti-discrimination focus group to have dinner.  Then there's a discussion of a worthwhile cause  accommodations for wheelchair users/others needing public transit  but then it degrades into a discussion about public smoking. "I am concerned about who this impacts disproportionally like people of lower income " one speaker says. Really? If they don't have any money maybe they ought to quit smoking cigarettes! More BS about Stewart's comments  and then a BS resolution to take a stand against anti-immigration ballot measures. Then there's the table of how $2 191.45 of taxpayer money (and equivalent sponsorship money) has been wasted  and a couple of requests for more money.,?

Denigrating said discoveries  and production  does nothing to promote the allowance unto the coffers that benefit us all.  There is the benefit of wealth  unto all Alaskans  resultant of said discoveries and production  in which all Alaskan citizens benefit from the riches within our State  or we can take the road of Gara  and his ilk  which chooses to ignore said riches unto the citizenry overall  but to attempt theft from those that earn a wage so as to enrich those that do not.  We have  in front of us  a great opportunity to enrich all of us  but Gara and his crew would rather bankrupt not only the entities that would provide said wealth  but to take from its earning citizens more to pay for those that do not.,?

I'd rather concentrate on getting the FDA to do its job so we all don't get food poisoning from the less favored birds  and the unspecial fish  as well as the totally unimportant cows and pigs.  Ever see local pork products teaming with maggots?  I have.  If you want to save the sea monks  NOAA says that a major cause of their deaths is starvation  so maybe you'd concentrate on preventing ocean acidification and over fishing. But you go door to door and try and round up the kitties to save us all from toxo  but I think it's a colossal waste of time.,?

The FBI says that its investigators "believed that Mr. Flynn was not entirely forthcoming" about the content of his conversations with the Russian ambassador when he was interviewed on January 26  2017.  That is law enforcement speak for lying and that raises the possibility of felony charges for obstruction of justice.     The acting attorney general  Sally Yates (since fired by Trump) was sufficiently concerned that she told the White House that Flynn was vulnerable to "Russian blackmail" because of inconsistencies between what he had said publicly and what intelligence officials knew to be true.  The US Senate's top Republican Mitch McConnell said it was "highly likely" that Flynn would have to testify before an intelligence panel and if he lies there...,?

Flyn is a dumb dumb or simply a traitor to his country either way when intelligence agencies are withholding information from the white house because they have no confidence that intel won't end up at the Kremlin it has turned into a grade A mess up.

11391,People are tired of seeing their countries overrun with illegal immigrants  crime   social parasites and welfare refugees and I applaud Hungary  Eastern Europe to protect their citizens and approve of  LePen.

11405,Honestly  I expect the Reporter to at least vaguely fact-check people that write in.   The author of this post is simply making things up. How do I know this? He falsely states that there are 6 outside shows/year at the high school.  Let's look at just one group that I am familiar with: Island Choral Experience. This group alone has 6 performances + 2 dress rehearsals just in the month of December (see http://www.islandchoralexperience.com/performances/) . That's 8 uses of the High School theatre by one group just in the month of December.  Using untruths may work in some parts of the country  but it doesn't work here.   Dan Grove,?

11414,As I read this story  the proposal would only impact those with a combined household income of $200K or more.  If you're in a "fixer-upper"   I'm guessing you folks don't make that $200K or more.  When I saw the headline  I gulped....However  as I read the story I saw they were not talking about me.  ...just about folks who make much  much more money than I do.  It's one of those taxes we all like.......I call them the "Otherguy" taxes...... Regards  Gary Crum,?
11415,"The guidelines...have not been shared beyond bishops and religious superiors to protect the policy from being misused...." So now the laity cannot know if the guidelines are adequate (or criticize them for not requiring informing the police)  nor can they know if they are being followed in specific cases.  "Penalties could be as severe as laicization...." Yes  it is the ultimate insult  punishment  and state of wretchedness to be a lay person. How perceptive of the monsignor deputy secretary general.  "...it was in line with the conference standards for a bishop...to keep in constant touch with the victim..." But maybe being in touch with the police or with a therapist would be more conducive to recovery.  "The scandals challenge bishops and other leaders to become humble...." And they certainly need the challenges.,?

11420,I'm liberalophobic  They scare me with their PC fascism.  Their vapid stupid lies that they are out to help people. (millions killed by their invented drug culture).  Their unreasoned hate of the white majority in favor of any minority  no matter how insignificant in population.  Their lockstep  kneejerk reactionary mentality to any cause that is anti-American.    Their inability to fathom that progressivism is actually regressivism as all of their beliefs have been tried before  even begetting  doomed civilizations because of the same philosophy.,?
11421,While they are looking at the air  soil  and water pollution from cadmium  arsenic  and chromium around these hotspots  they should add lead to the analyses. Also  when they start looking much more closely at school children  at increased proximity to hotspot exposures  they should not just rely on blood and urine metal content  but also at body burden stored records to see how these metals have built up more in those exposed heavily compared to others across the city. They could start with comparative assessment of shed baby teeth  Laser ablation ICPMS might look at the growth increments in the teeth that variably show up take during times of higher output from the sources of pollution. The results can compare to teeth of children elsewhere in the city. The body burden levels are even more important to understand than the levels that the body has managed to get rid of.,?

11423,DennisCasaccio The US is a sample of one. And a very wealthy sample.   A major fault in the American system is there is no connection between their first class medical system and the poor.  The cost of treatment at the front end will be the same whether the system is public or private.  Same doctors  same nurses. The cost to the system will depend on the overhead. And government is not noted for low overhead.   The private sector works well in every sector where it is allowed to work  from dentistry to legal firms  to insurances of all type  groceries  housing. Why should health care be any different?  Put another way there are thousands of businesses providing us  with virtually all the goods and services except health care. There is one sample where it appears that the private sector is not performing and that is in the US  in health care.   I would bet on the system used by thousands of businesses rather than the one example from the US. There is something missing.,?

11428,Great Leaders Like Gov.

Life would be great again if Alaskans would ask all the state leaders to stop the big three oil monopoly and stop pricing Alaskans out of the oil business with the state's very broken and complicated oil and gas system!   The harsh oil and gas agencies and the state's massive red tape has us in decline and buying way too much oil from the Middle East that is home of the Islamic state where many want to kill Americans!  Under the new leadership in the DNR DOG with Gov. Walker's wise advisors. like Mr. Hendrix Alaska will be America's number one oil producer like it once was! I pray everyone will support the new oil boom in Alaska with Armstrong and Caelus leading the way with 3 to 6 billion barrels discoveries! Go Trump and Go Walker!!,?

11431,Colorado Springs and Boulder BOTH have the issue of idiots feeding and encouraging bears to come into the city.   Both have even MORE IDIOTS that then pounce on their neighbors for reporting the bears that their own stupidity dragged into the city  when those bears are moved or destroyed.   The sad thing is that if the situation were fair the idiots bringing bears into the city with their actions would be fined and relocated somewhere where they couldn't cause trouble...the bears are paying for moronic humans errors in judgement.,?

11436,Finally  Mike Chenault's secretive caucus method of government is breaking up like the Yukon in springtime.   No longer can he  with any degree of certainty   manipulate committee referrals to have his toady cronies  hold bills to death or see them "expedited" to please the oligarchy.  His beloved system could only last as long as bloated and unsustainable spending "greased" the quid pro quo that traded spending for toady behavior. Now there is no point for the "bush democrats" to align with the House Republicans.  The Senate will follow after Olson and Hoffman realize the futility of their current allegiance to a group that cannot deliver the bacon.    We are seeing a  "every man (and woman) for themselves"  panic in the legislative majority and I can't think of a more deserving bunch.  Perhaps  in the future  the people of Alaska will once again be represented in the Alaska Legislature.,?

11443,I think the problem is the exact opposite it's far to easy to get native status in certain parts of Canada.When natives were given unlimited hunting and fishing rights people were coming out of the woodwork to apply citing some ancestor who had aboriginal blood.Their should be a  limit on how far back this can go both native and non native Canadians would benefit!!!,?
11444,Financial Abusers..that is definitely one major factor we have children in the crosshairs of each partner. Child Support Laws need to be changed. It needs to be minimum requirement on what child needs to live healthy. This includes monthly shelter  heathy food for a month  monthly medical coverage: well child/immunization  and medical emergencies  deductible  club funds to boost connection to school/environment and this is the responsibility of both  and enforceable across state lines. The minimum requirement needs to be 600 per kid. Not based on income guidelines unless the parents  parent can easily afford more. Non custodians think child support  freak  quit jobs  force custodials into hardships. Blaming  It is about raising although separate a child. Support needs to be required to reach the age of 22 to get them college bound  and more than 2 months behind automatically means jail  warrant for arrest. Im so tired of dead beat parents on both sides and see children struggle.,?
11445,This woman exercised her free speech  and I would think giving the finger on a live broadcast would have been the LEAST thing to worry about. Why aren't Democrats getting pissed at how this all played out? Even AFTER the emails were leaked  having Schultz "resign" and then make her a chairwoman in her campaign should feel like a slap in the face to all the voters! Seriously people  what in the honest to goodness fuck are you guys getting pissed off about? Your anger and resentment is pointed at the wrong person and the wrong actions. Chelsea Lyons Kent was just fed up with all the bullshit and happened to be in front of the camera at that time and she took it and ran with it. Big ups to her for exercising her free speech and doing what she felt she needed to do. If I was there  It'd probably be much worse than just a middle finger. And for all you Dems who support HRC  good on you  that's your choice  but in all honesty how the hell do you guys sleep at night?,?

11453,You make a silly point.  Whether we recognize them as a nation state doesn't matter.  These people are operating totally  completely as a nation state.  The state is providing for the common good of the people.   Elections are held  representation is done  law exists  law is being enforced  taxes collected  justice is meted out.  Property and rights are being protected.  There is a functioning government in place  unlike Somalia.    It's a governed.  As a matter of justice we OWE them due recognition.  It's not a matter of our opinion  or simply because we've been cowardly for the last 40 years.,?

11460,“The UO protestors — about 15 in all — say they’ll maintain their business-hours vigil through next Wednesday  take spring break off and then resume the sit-in upon return to campus.”  It’s encouraging to see how serious these protestors are.  Chaining themselves to a 9 to 5 sit-in  taking only spring break off  then back to that grueling  agonizing 9 to 5 sit in.    Refusing food from their protestee’s  thereby subjecting themselves to an debilitating 8 hours without sustenance.  Bravo to their dedication and perseverance to the cause.  An inspiration to all protestors regardless of their cause.,?

11462,Thompson and his fundamentalist bible bangers demand obedience to a god to fix everything.  It is called a Theocracy and ruled the European world for centuries as the Holy Roman Empire.  Why bother with voting  elections  or government.  Just bring the Pope over from the Vatican to rule as he is the proclaimed messenger of god and its trinity.  Let the preachers  ministers  priests  monsignors  bishops  archbishop  cardinals decide all things for everyone.  Escaping the Holy Roman Empire was the one of the first reasons for the revolution.  The fundamentalist brethren of Thompson just voted in a pathological liar  an adulterer  a sexual predator  a business cheat  a non-taxpaying scofflaw  a hedonist  who has committed every sin found in the bibles  Koran  or any religious dogma.  How is it justified?  Because they believe in fairy tales and invisible beings created by other humans without any verifiable factual existence of any of it.  Theocray so preferable to any Democracy.,?
11463,Non-whites should be banned also.,?
11464,Ha ha! Two pages of a twelve year old tax return which do not show where the $150 million came from. I wonder how much of this income came from Russia and UAE? Trumo is a rich man hoping to make rich men in America richer. He recently tweeted that a large group of CEOs were excited  I wonder why? As we've learned recently  his Healthcare plan will save the rich more; deregulation will make the rich richer; and he said he wanted to do away with the alternative minimum tax. In Trumps cabinet and in his circle of friends  there is only room for the filthy rich. I would be more interested in seeing Trump release a more recent tax return showing where his millions come from.,?
11465,You are right of course. I tried to nuance your valid comments at the risk of appearing to take the opposite and/or minimalist view. My caution is somewhat idealistic and maybe ephemeral.  However.... I do think that difference has purpose and meaning. If we seek to erase difference rather than seek meaning and proper placement we have lost and just gone to the other side. I agree completely that sexual differences/similarities have been used abusively to foster social  political and religious self-interests to the detriment of real people. If the objective of peership requires over-emphesis on sameness then so be it. I guess. For myself  I prefer inclusion and let the differences emerge from encounter rather than erasure on the one hand or mythical elevation as we have done.,?
11466,$100 million for dedicated bus lanes that will cause citizens County- and city-wide to abandon their cars and hop on a bus that will restrict when and where they can travel and then delay their arrival to an appointed location by thirty minutes to an hour? What kind of criminal insanity is driving (pardon the pun) this madness? Brought to us by the people who have never  and never will  set foot on a bus. If you don't believe me  poll the employees at $LTD and ask them how many of their employees drive to work. Let's end this lunacy now and remove the "Bus Only" lane markings from our expensive new highways and return this property back to the people who CHOOSE to drive cars - the taxpayers.,?
11467,On the IRAN  NAFTA  OBAMACARE  DYNK  Puerto Rico  NFL  Las Vegas killings and every other Policy Portfolio that dTrump has a finger in it proves to anyone with an IQ over 20 that  without doubt that he is a MORONIC   DEMENTED and DEPRAVED IMBECILE who needs to be removed from the WH by any means possible ASAP before his hourly brain farts further effect climate change and/or kill every single Americans' brain cells and cause more than the incredulous damage he has already generated!   Pity poor 'Mellania and Ivaanka'....likely sex slaves or even worse . dTrump0 could not be trusted to run a children's lemonade stand in the middle of Yellowstone Park's Volcano if there were  any females within afew  hundred miles of it.

11480,There's no denying? While you are clearly find this critical  reality is that most hold your #1 priority much closer to #10.   As for Trump  that you don't like him is evident  but what he will do remains to be seen. As he won the election  at least some of the "common man" don't hold your opinion on him.

You ALL LIED to us the taxpayers and I'm sure MOST if not ALL of these elected officials knew the numbers were wrong but NO ONE SAID ANYTHING... You fools are SICKENING and should ALL be removed from office and tar and feathered... you have destroyed the future of this city and have taxed us to death.    Your kids and grandkids will NEVER forgive you !!,?
11484,All the religious terrorists that have tried to kill me have been white Christians. Of course  I'm black. No one has to leave this country to learn to hate.,?
11485,OIA Brass. What a bunch of wimps!,?
11486,If true - and that's a huge 'if' - then I'm all for it. Maybe something mutually acceptable will come of it.,?
11487,That's true. I find myself driving more often and further to businesses that offer free EV charging.  I seldom charge at home because there are hundreds of free public stations to top-up at.  I sometimes feel guilty but then I think of those F-350 stupid-duty air-haulers bragging about their coal-rollers.,?
11488,Don't you remember  Marilyn Lee filed papers to run on the day her husband suddenly retired leaving no chance for anyone else to run. Devious ploy  indeed.,?
11489,Tell your president that. lol  You know  the p**** grabbin liar.  aloha and mahalo,?
11490,I realize far right wacko don't care because it is ok if you are republican.  You can lie all you want and its ok if you are republican.  Well I don't accept this hypocrisy and will call this liar out everry chance I get.  So Dragon  how are you enoying your new job building the wall?  Isn't the new health care plan simply wonderful?  lol  Keep enjoying the do nothing president.  He is good for a few laughs.,?
11491,Thank you Jill for this brilliantly informative piece.,?
11492,The Liberals were of the view as opposition  that lowering the Health transfers by 3.0% from 6.0% was a cut that would leave the Provinces a $36.0 billion dollar shortfall. Come on Liberals  when are you going to do your job and hold this government to the same standard.,?
11493,Cut welfare to the pathetic to fix the pathetic roads~,?
11494,I don't care which wall they choose. Just put the damn wall up !!! Whatever it costs it's worth it.  I'm tired of Educating  Medicating  Incarcerating these illegals and their anchor babies.  Oh........ and one more thing  it's not all visa people.,?
11495,Fuck off Isis,?
11496,I was entitled and bitchy about this winter until I just got back from the -15 that is Edmonton.  Not going to bitch about +4 and crappy snow (that won't go away in half a day like usual) now.  Then again  I might bitch a little.....cause well....,?
11497,>>There should be a no fly list for jerks like this    And no more  jerk chicken either.,?
11498,The content is there. But you have to read it. Your last two sentences are just plain dumb.,?
11499,I trust Civil Beat more than any other news in Hawaii!!!!,?
11500,I think he is was being sarcastic....,?
11501,another ignorant sheep  the usa for decades has been using the dialogue method and ITS failed  now we have a real leader putting the kid in his place and btw china has just begun pushing NK back  to say they failed is typical of liberal nonsense ,?
11502,Does Putin give a damn what Obama says now?  The stupidity Obama's bluster is matched only by the media's willingness to report it as a valid  political move.   Obama gets to keep his Nobel Prize  no matter how he tarnishes it.  Or is it Obama's intention to sour relations wit Russia to such  toxic levels so that Trump will  get  blamed when relations deteriorate further? ?,?
11503,Maybe it'll be fun to watch a bunch of second-rate fatties lace up for the Olympics.,?
11504,What a load of BS.  Give this idiot 10 years  THEN send him home.  Liberal Clown legal system....,?
11505,At this point in time  for those who are not in favor of continuing Chin's actions to the courts on this  they need to pick up the phone  email and let it be known to Governor Ige that this action is not favoured by the people of Hawaii. As I mentioned to a friend last night when they were asking my POV on this matter  I said that if AG Chin continues to file with the courts  after Judge Watson came down with his ruling  that the drive was not just from Chin  but from the Governor himself.  Because someone has to approve paying the bills on this one  and the Governor seems to be very inclined to keep the argument going. For what sake  not sure unless it is all about keeping Hawaii in the news.  If that is the case  and the only case  than I can think of way cheaper ways of keeping Hawaii in the limelight than doing stuff like this.,?
11506,Sorry.. but thanks for showing your pre-bias and eagerness to make judgments on people you don't even know.  I've never watched the Kardashians.  I consider those type of shows garbage and have better things to do with my time.  Like replying to idiots on ADN's web blog!  Not calling you an idiot... just sayin...if the shoe fits!,?
11507,Yes  much better written account in HHN. Based on that story  I doubt that the family has a case against anyone. Just about everyone will state that their dog is sweet and friendly but that is often only towards their owners. The HHN article indicated that the dog lunged at the security guard. I know several dog trainers who have told me that there is no such thing as a harmless dog  especially if they're large as this one appears to be. What I find surprising is that a Securitas guard was armed. I'm use to seeing only old  out of shape  traffic control people at the airport.,?
11508,I think we can all agree on that. The Trump campaign should have taken the high road and avoided any interference from the Russians at all. They have shown they do not deserve the leadership.,?
11509,Judging by the Comments on health care articles in the last few months  Canadians no longer believe that our health care is the best in the world. Another myth which needs attention is the cost of health care in the private sector. That is plain silly. One has a choice of health care. Just as in car  house or life insurance one selects the quality of health care desired. There is no need to select and pay for the level chosen by gov't.  Another huge advantage of health care in the private sector is that the taxpayer no longer pays for those who are able to pay themselves. US data would suggest that is about 83% of the population. An 83% reduction in cost to the taxpayer. About 17% of Canadians would need taxpayer help.   So cost would be under the control of individual Canadians just like food and housing and whatever. No periodic cost of health care discussions. Health care would be just another part of our individual lives. We select cost.,?
11510,Leave it alone.  Stupid move.  Let businesses decide and manage their own parking lots  who they allow or don't allow.  This is ill advised.  I am disappointed in Eric Croft on this one  and Lottie Michael as well  two people I otherwise have a large amount of respect for.,?
11511,everyone is saying she must have wanted to get arrested because who would be dumb enough to rob a bank without a mask.  However  no one has raised the possibility that she might have just been that dumb.  Just saying.,?
11512,There are proposals to screen refugees  immigrants and visitors for “anti-Canadian values” – all utterly useless.  Marie Henein --------------- an anti Canadian value for example is going to a place of worship and killing people  should we not support Kellie Leitch on this ?,?
11513,Why has this disgraced clown not quit yet??  Maybe the $160K+ senate salary for being a sober second thinker is too enticing.,?
11514,Headline in 25 years "Council votes to disband Waikiki Transportation Management Association as corruption probe continues",?
11515,Simple solution.  Those still willing to forego some of their own economic interest in favour of protecting the planet longer-term (i.e. those who continue to support the Accord) just need to impose a 50% duty on imports from those who don't (i.e. the US and Syria).  Time to tell the emperor he has no clothes and cut the US out of the action.  They've bullied the world for too long.,?
11516,How about throwing him out of office   common thief.,?
11517,MA:  Cities like Portland  have a sales tax among many others.  Do you support instituting a sales tax to generate more revenues which is really what this article is about?,?
11518,Isn't the overhead way more costly with this method though? I feel like it would take far to long to have it pay for itself with the cost associated with all the tech and infrastructure. Even the cost for maintaining this system would be pretty crazy too considering all the equipment you would need to replace and fix. I don't really know  I'm just honestly curious.,?
11519,"I learned that those who are both “religious” and righteous are some of the most dangerous people on this earth."    Yes radical Islam is very dangerous.  #NeverHillary,?
11520,"Instead of faith being just that  i.e. a deep-rooted belief in higher powers and the redemptive potential of love and forgiveness that is made stronger by virtue of it being unprovable"  Stupid undiscerning comment.  Jesus Christ is the most attested figure in ancient history.,?
11521,How about doing spot engineering inspections on the already'' inspected'' materials and construction? If there are faults and the work has been signed off by the previous inspector  then that inspectors license gets pulled.,?
11522,Cruz is just one in a long line of incompetent Dem Mayors who blame everyone but themselves for their botched responses to natural disasters.  And of course the liberal media is more than happy to further their pathetic excuses.,?
11523,Of course.  What better way to prove for certain that Trump is a tin pot dictator than to prosecute his election opponent?  What could go wrong?  Trump is a failed mess because he's an imbecile who knows none of the things a President needs to know.  He is pridefully and willfully ignorant of how government works  so it's no surprise that his administration is in the flaming tailspin it's in now.,?
11524,Careful on the litter box thing. I'd hate to see them all pieces of shit and smelling like roses!,?
11525,What it really is is the banner or white supremacists and racists.,?
11526,Youro?  This so repugnant.,?
11527,No matter how hard the liberal bishops and Pope Francis try.  The only followers they now have are illegals  home ose xuals  muslims and Protestantized Catholics.,?
11528,If they take the pfd  I guarantee EVERY time the state 'needs' something  the money thirsty free crap promising politicians will take it forever. They will come up with excuses to take it  and in 5 years we will never get a decent one again.,?
11529," May we never again have to remind you that we shut it down for all of us" said the sign...how inclusively non-threatening and blandly unaware.  to which I could say  " may you hopefully come to understand that we could have moved you at any time  but we're not like you",?
11530,A waste of state resources to call a special session on the basis of shaky data. Where’s the work on the complete revenue package we really need?,?
11531,In the past  business used to go to politicians and buy them.  What they have done here is eliminate the middleman.  Now business owns the government.   Its like we went back to the 1800's  Soon we will see debtors prisons and child labor orphanages.      We came from serfs and lords and that's where we are headed.   Most of the no tax right wingers can't see it  or don't care because it will not get here till they are gone.   Still buy their grandchildren presents though.,?
11532,its one thing to choose to go through life as a victim  its an entirely different matter when you expect the same from everyone else.  ....and to openly admit  in writing  that you would lie to police to further your victimhood. just pathetic.,?
11533,it's not so much that these people are a certain way  as the country has quietly agreed to do so damned little about it,?
11534,Sounds like they got a stupid rule that if they cannot or will not communicate intelligently  then you are suspicious. Stupid rules made for stupid high school graduates by stupid rule inventors in the Homeland Security Agency and approved by stupid Congressional approvers who don't understand their logic but will approve them because they are too busy making money for their re-election campaigns or themselves. I will stop voting from now on. It's just a waste of time.,?
11535,I have zero tolerance for people whose actions manifest their bigotry  racism  and hatred. It's Trump himself I was referring to.  The God of my understanding can perform good deeds in people who are severely lacking in virtue. There are  in fact  millions of our fellow citizens want Trump to succeed even though by doing so they will be accused by others of being imbeciles.,?
11536,You got it right!  "70 probation officer Positions" @ how much each?  Cash +benefits+retirement + medical for an est 30 years each. Don't forget the new workers will require  training  office space  clerks  and a new buildings/heat-ele-phone-parking.  Try figuring the yearly cost in pfd checks.,?
11537,You are a sick pervert. And the ones who agree with you are a rouge's gallery of leftists sickos starting with spy vs spy.,?
11538,Tell it to the Amish!,?
11539,Get out of here with your science  nerd!,?
11540,Congratulations!! That's about the dumbest comment I've seen today.,?
11541,I am a resident of Grandview-Woodland  living under the dangling sword of renoviction. There's no word yet  but I live in an nearly-50 year-old apartment building  being carefully maintained just above dereliction level. I am 70 years old  in poor health (not because of drugs or alcohol)  and my rent consumes 75% of my income. And of course the rent goes up every year. I have no idea where I can go when the eviction comes. I was born and raised in Vancouver. Even if I try to move to the very edge of the Vancouver area — Coquitlam  Mission  and so on  I will not find a home I can afford. Where will I go? How will I live? I am an multiple-award-winning writer/artist  but you know how well that pays. I would like to continue my arts career until I am too old to function  and I would also like to stay in my neighbourhood  and my city  where my friends are. I doubt if I can continue anything at all in the future that looms. A hex upon the greedy developers  and Mayor Robertson  their pal.,?
11542,Zanele  You and your mob are very big deal and full of bravado when 5 or 10 of you abuse 60 year old journalists outside their home and skinny Indian journalists outside SABC studios.  Let's see you try that at the Free state Afriforum meeting with a few 120 kg farmers in  attendance.  FYI the appropriate response when someone says "F**k you" is either to ignore it  or respond with "f**k you  too  and the horse that you rode in on".  My personal favourite is "F**k you very much  sir / madam" - it normally generates a bemused stare.,?
11543,lets see. Who is pushing the wall with trillions of $ that we do not have? Why Trump and the rest of the far right. Who is pushing for HORRIBLE insurance stuff that will simply waste more money? Why Trump and the rest of the far right.  Who is a real idiot? Why trump and the rest of the far right.   And you call him LIBERAL?,?
11544,What an ignorant comment from Mr. Khan.  Insult to every man and woman that laced up a pair of boots in service to this nation !!,?

11547,' ...Kara Moriarty  president of the Alaska Oil and Gas Association    ….contorted herself into a virtual pretzel while trying and failing to defend her corporate masters. . Rising rates of non-resident hire for 8 years straight. . More incontrovertible evidence that the oil welfare supporters can ignore while feigning their concern for Alaskans.  (…I'm talking to you  Republican voters.)  .  SB21's multi-million dollar PR campaign promised all kinds of things.  Not a one of which ever came to fruition. . I don't know why they bother with all that propaganda    Republican voters aren't ever going to hold anyone to their promises    … with them and their corporate masters  ….it's all for show.     .  Next time one of those oil welfare boosters start in  …just laugh a little  then point straight up into the sky.  When they look up  …give them a little chuck under the chin   …then pat them on the top of the head and show them the door. .,?
11548,Anybody that supports KKK Nazis  etc. is a well rehearsed liar otherwise they'd have been outed years ago. So now you know the boss is a liar which means he's probably a jerk or even more likely complete asshole. So basically people quit a shitty minimum wage job because the boss is an asshole. Those jobs are NOT worth having in the first place unless you also are a retarded racist.. Go back to school so you can get a decent fucking job.,?
11549,Florida surpassed New York state a few years ago and is now the third-largest state by population  not the fourth-largest as stated in the article.,?
11550,great  this guy was a phony  just like trump.  and like trump he is a racist  bigot and stupid.,?
11551,Your hero  Trump  said that Mexicans in general are rapists and drug dealers. The man is racist  as are many of his supporters -- and he has not done or said anything to repudiate the racism of those supporters.  No  utilitas  you support a narcissist whose attention span would shame a three-year-old  a racist and sexist who boasted of grabbing women by the genitals  who actually made money out of each one of his four (or is it six) bankruptcies  a man who has no regard for the truth and enriches himself through his office.,?
11552,Thanks Blankenyblank. These threads say it all. True "nimrods" don't need or want a lazy way to show there marksmanship abilities. Personally  I've always respected the bow & arrow hunter much more. The skill it requires takes years of practice. tRump is an idiot suggesting that Clinton wants to take away people's right to bear arms  not WMDs. Only the uneducated tRump supporter thinks otherwise.,?
11553,The author raises the valid point that there may be some method to the madness of King Trump. When his opponents are enjoying Alec Baldwin on SNL  they are spending less time fighting the substantial and dangerous changes to America. The easing of emission standards will increase the energy needs of the USA for a long time  since the inefficient vehicles that will result have long and increasing service lifes. Trump is committed to decreasing taxes for individuals and businesses  even though the USA has among the lowest levels of effective (not nominal) taxes in the industrialized world. Once tax cuts go into effect  they are tough to remove  even though many of the problems in the USA are the result of under-investment in services that are handled more efficiently elsewhere in the public sector. Healthcare is the prime example but infrastructure is also a mess and will be made worse by the terribly inefficient Trump plan to address it.,?
11554,Vancouverite protesting Trump .Now they call him a racist in Canada with no examples of how he is racist and just running on romours becuase that is all left thinking people can say when they lodt the election and for some reason Canada thinks they should open their stupid protesting agenada.He like Muslims but not radical ones. he is not sexist but the sheep are following the lies,?
11555,Intimidation  personal image   sexism  narcissism  arrogance  scapegoating  success at all costs. That's America. The "liberals" do it with much more subtlety. Their hypocrisy and self-delusion are seemingly beyond redemption.   Trump won because never in political history has one man revealed so much about so many. And Americans were very overdue to hear those truths.,?
11556,Nice to see Dunn starting to look good again. Rusin has been struggling a bit but the addition of Neshik is a Godsend. Good job all around.,?
11557,You think The Globe is left wing? Is that why it supported Harper in every election. Backed Tim Hudak  over Wynne in Ontario.  And urged voters to vote against Notley in Alberta. You actually think the richest person in Canada  David Thomson  who owns The Globe   and its Report on Business  is producing a "leftist" product? Your in ability to understand these basics undermines any other ideas you may put forward.,?
11558,The so called "king tides" have nothing to do with global warming. Get your facts straight. Renewable energy is not yet even close to being efficient.  In fact;  It is so in-efficient  without government subsidies  nobody would be involved.,?
11559,She is no loser. I doubt seriously if you would ever be considered for the program.,?
11560,Poor Dr K Dave. Is this your comment template? How many times to I read "how does garbage like this pass for journalism"? Why are you here? I doubt you even read the articles as it's far too easy to write "how does garbage like this pass for journalism" straight away once you know one of your enemy journalists has posted. There's nothing random about the tweets about #M103  They are real and mostly "over the top"  but I won't see you complaining about "garbage like this" passing for commentary.,?
11561,If I go down due to a fat boy perp nuclear bomb I sure as hell hope that the Pentagon wipes N. Korea off the map for me as well as the rest who go down in Hawaii.,?
11562,Us hard working taxpayers continue to get raped financially by this liberal government!!! Sorry folks but every single person in this country has some form of injustice done to them - now does that mean that every injustice needs to be financially compensated?? I think the government might as well hand over $10 million cash to everybody to solve all the problems since they seem to think handouts solve the problems. This is really getting stupid!!!,?
11563,LOL  AK residents ranking their own physical health near excellent. Outside of the Deep South  AK residents are some of the fattest ever.   LOL  AK residents rank near excellent their "access to nutritious food". 9 months out of the year produce has to be imported from the lower 48 and is in terrible condition when arriving and expensive which is why residents dont eat enough of it.  LOL  AK residents rank their financial security very high. Outside of CA and NYC  Anchorage has some of the highest cost of living in the nation  higher than Phoenix  Miami  Dallas  Chicago  etc. With AKs one-trick-pony for revenue  oil  which is now priced below production costs forcing BP and Conoco Phillips to mothball expansion  production  and maintenance contracts to reduce their spending  Shell cancelling their multi-billion dollar oil platform  and the talk of getting rid of the PFD and instating an income tax  AK is in trouble.  LOL  but we all agree  AK is sure pretty to look at.,?
11564,Like maybe you could explain how there are consequences  good and bad  for each action you take in life....... Like tell your kid that if you use drugs and run around the streets with guns and have no self control or upside down priorities that you will suffer the consequences of not being a contributing member of society.   Like maybe just have a truthful conversation with your kid......,?
11565,Do us a favor and stop acting like this fool has anything of importance that we want to hear!  McCain do the country a favor and retire before your brain damage becomes even more apparent.,?
11566,Probably another "mentally ill" person too ill to go to trial.  There used to be institutions for people like him.   Saved a ton of taxpayer money bulldozing them  didn't you now?  The best intervention is rendering the person incapable of resistance.  Those three men learned you don't talk down racists and bigots.   Sorry for their families and friends.,?
11567,It's not illegal for him to express his opinion on this matter - dumb  but not illegal,?
11568,Did you abuse the "flag" icon to remove my comments? I'm trying to figure out how the two comments disappeared so quickly when I was under the impression that comments had to be rated by a jury of fellow commenters using the civil comments system. Please be honest. Is it really possible to "flag" a comment without going through the process?,?
11569,Enough is enough! Time to kick Robertson and his merry band of silly socialists to the curb.,?
11570,Lisa Murkowski endorsed Donald Trump. After that  does she deserve the honor of representing Alaskans?  Same goes for Young.,?
11571,i gotta get back to work asap.......i no like my nickname lazy maizey,?
11572,Hey troll. Back at it making your useless  snide self-revealing comments after stealing the online identity of a decent commenter.   Yeah  you represent that clown  Trump  very well. Loser.,?
11573,@ "Rational" - the reason why you see nothing wrong is because you are a conservative supporter.  That you are defending a clearly apparent conflict while smearing another obvious conflict makes that abundantly clear.  Person has prominent position in government.  Person's partner is buddies with a billionaire.  Billionaire gets $100-million (for some inexplicable reason) from government.  It's hardly a stretch to see the line there.  And  before you start - no  I did not vote for the LPC.,?

11577,I'd like to see a detailed response from all major Presidential candidates relating to this bill  its passage  and US government support for those who use this bill (families) should it be signed by Obama.,?
11578,Silly.    Put some data behind your claims.   Or just let your CH4 innuendo waft untethered to facts  your call.,?
11579,Now if ADN's stupid banner would go away...,?
11580,racist  psychotic  ...(.sigh),?
11581,You are missing a few details    ... Most scientists agree that some of the change is anthropogenic.  The part that bothers me is that big money  apparently has more influence over our political decision makers than thousands of scientist all around the world with real data.  It suggests that we are dealing with some significant ignorance  [on the part of the politicians and a gullible public]  or some very serious unethical behavior    ... or both.,?
11582,As is getting your head cut off.,?
11583,"Homeless families with children..."  So let's encourage the homeless to reproduce & get rewarded?,?
11584,No  not these protesters. You're thinking of yourself  and all the other whiners who complained non-stop about nothing for 8 years under Obama. And you're all STILL complaining after your rabid golden retriever won.  Pathetic.,?
11585,Wow  these guys are all pathological liars......quelle surprise  see ya Forrest Beauregarde Sessions.,?
11586,Civil comments  once again you will not publish my completely civil comment. I want an explanation.  I spend a lot of time and thought framing my comments and making them civil. Yet your stupid application scrubs a quarter of them  for no discernible reason. If you can't fix this  I can't continue to post. This is preposterous considering that I have made moderation in speech my goal  yet you allow the gross violations of civility to pass muster.  Hello! Are you there?,?
11587,"Who knows?" What I do know is that when I have a medical procedure done  I don't expect to be filmed without my consent. Dr. Lookhart's behavior is quite frankly  disgusting.,?

11589,"The U.S. system of checks and balances was designed to preclude the kind of tyranny some are warning could accompany a Trump presidency."  However  in the modern day those CBs don't prevent an idiot from getting us into a war  even a nuclear war. There is much to worry about with a POTUS Trump.,?
11590,Pete Antonson has his "facts" all wrong.  I don't live on Kauai.  The last time I was there was about 10 years ago  and only for a few days.  I don't know what the Eastside bike path is  much less where it is  and even less where the dead horse is.  Antonson has a right to an opinion about the JFF  but it is based on these kinds of imaginary "facts.",?
11591,Suck it up buttercup we all have bills to pay,?
11592,No  the conversation doesn't go like that short circuit in your brain.      And  your attempt at superior sarcasm makes you to be a fool  instead.,?

11595,Well Janette thanks for your honest comment  try to read around the rhetoric  and see what he is trying to accomplish. 44% of the previous administrations budget has been slashed for cause. Everyone is moaning about it because it effects everyone. First clue he is doing right. He is  coaxing the legislature in doing what's right and get to a solution on the budget. After just under 10 special sessions he has called to do just that  they still are locked before a deadline of July 1st and chaos if they don't act. Next election will hopefully clear the brush.  You want to blame the Governor for trying to have a recognizable strong Alaska 10 years from now ? A polarized snot slinging does not apply here. My allegiance is with Alaska  not right wing  left wing  Lib or Con  Socialism or Capitalism   that is political talking points imported from outside. In Alaska  it is what make sense.,?
11596,Ruiz’s pathetic response (continued):  "I also believe that it is not in your natural character to unjustly ascribe motives or question integrity.  Many  including me  are frustrated with the city hall project  and it will be easy to seek the worst in people rather than aspire to a city hall that I believe the council and community envision: one that defines the legacy not of individuals  but of the proud  unique and vibrant community we call home. Jon"  Classic dodging any responsibility or accountability  and trying to make George out as the bad guy.  And guess who follows up in another e-mail in less than 30 minutes? (See below),?
11597,My advice to " Tweety " is  do not mess with the Chinese.  If you do  you'll regret it.  If the Chinese are still smarting over the destruction in 1860 of the Yuanmingyuan - 圆明园 - one of the most horribly devastating acts of British and French imperialism  the anger  will cause Chinese to smash you to smithereens.  And you know what  you'll will deserve it.  However this time  it will take you a hundred years to forget what they have done to you in retaliation for your stupidity.,?
11598,False equivalency. That's a talking point  and you just used it wrong.  Learn the subject before you expose yourself as an idiot and parrot the wrong Talking points on the wrong think piece,?
11599,Oh  so the idiots who run the Sierra Club (and their supporters) don’t benefit from security lighting that dampens all crime in their cities.  They must think night lighting comes from pixie dust.  Perry should also suggest young women in Third World Nations and Islamic controlled countries be issued a pink 38 caliber pistol.  Armed blacks using their second amendment rights ended the reign of terror they faced from the KKK.  It will work for oppressed women too.  What do you think  Libs?,?
11600,Please point out specifically where Caplan made such a ridiculous claim that anyone voting for McCain is a racist.  He did not say that or imply it.  Your comment just highlights your comprehension skills are corrupted by what you want to complain about.,?
11601,Simple  its really ugly looking!,?
11602,you are so pathetically desperate to be loved by commenting "like" on every comment you post,?
11603,And I would agree with that.   But I've seen and experienced lives where refer is just a  cover thrown over very real problems that the individual doesn't want to acknowledge or deal with.    It could be emotional trauma  it could be just forgetting to pay bills.    There are very few cognitive functions that  marijuana improves.  Creativity sure  relieves stress absolutely  lowers blood pressure-yep.      We all have a natural  if undeveloped ability to experience most anything marijuana can provide  and much more.    Whether it's the mystic or the scientist  all would be hampered by the any regular use of pot.     It's insane to criminalize pot.    There are many things that destroy our potential as a human being  many of them legal.   I'm fine with individual choice.   But if a personal choice creates a measurable problem to the safety and welfare of the community  it needs to be stopped or at least discouraged.    I don't think marijuana is at that level.,?
11604,The problem clearly is that Bill Morneau has demonstrated a total lack of honesty and good judgement.  He shouldn't have had to ask the ethics commissioner what to do with his personal wealth!  Is he that stupid?,?
11605,... these War Lovers could care LESS about increasing Defense spending from $610 BILLION in 2017 to $665 BILLION in 2018.    But taking care of AMERICANS who need help is to be questioned on deficit concerns ... what the f**k is WRONG WITH REPUBLICANS??!!,?
11606,Modern 'bunker busters' contain U-238 (depleted uranium).   This would leave radioactive waste.  This makes the MOAB a better choice maybe?,?
11607,Of course he was homophobic and misogynist.  By today's standards everyone in 1850 was homophobic and misogynistic.  What a laugh.  And this dude is a University President.  U Chicago is my school and in my will  I am thinking of deleting them for employing such an idiot.,?
11608,If you get elected to office and really will talk with others of our legislature  with out interrupting them until they finish their thought  then I'm all for you. However  it appears that both parties have their marching orders dictated to them by their party leaders. It will make no difference if we elect new republicans because they all have to dance to the party music. It's the same with the democrats  so what's the answer? Should we try to teach our legislators how to debate honestly? Can they be taught respect for each other and not look down their noses when they are in the majority? I think it can never happen because our legislators are more interested in protecting their job rather than actually committing to do it! Why is it not possible to respect each other and actually develop a plan that can withstand the test of time? There's too many committees and not enough debate on the floor. It's like a soap opera!,?
11609,Canadians  including the writer of this piece  are completely clueless about the so-called religion of Islam. Before 9/11. Canadians  by in large didn't know what Islam was or that there were any Moslems living in Canada. Now thanks to Liberals and progressives  we are are following their agenda and fed their propaganda on a daily basis The Left conveniently forgets/ignores Islam's finer attributes  forced marriage  no women's rights  etc. They conveniently forget that this "religion" was founded by a lying war-mongering pedophile  whose entire agenda was that the world must submit to Islam. What a great future Islam holds in store for us. However  we are a nation of laws and religion is protected and everyone is guaranteed to right to practice whatever mumbo-jumbo they chose to believe in. Just a final note to all those ignorant Liberal and NDP MPs..............................Islam is not a RACE. It is a religion!  Stop calling Islamophobia racist  it just highlights your stupidity.,?
11610,What are the Democrats doing?  Sitting on their hands?  It would be nice if they would propose something to fix very high deductibles and way overpriced plans.,?
11611,He really showed what an awful human being is! He was given everything and he really has no humanity except in a negative manner - Greed and amoral behavior  every attribute antithetical to Christianity and about every other religion - he's a bum's rush and attractive to other lost souls. So why is he attractive? He doesn't pay taxes? He is over his head in losses? He's getting away with it.  But why the attraction to the Moralist Christian's?  Are they this stupid or do they already just support similar characters in their pulpits? It's a mystery because he's really mean! Time to get right with one's soul despite what the party says! The Bush Family has done so  but Ted Cruz is incredible. How bad does it need to get? Just read in The Belly of the Beast!,?
11612,Grant didn't.,?

11614,A woman's fertility is the woman's not yours.  So unless you are willing to drop your pants and put your prostate health into our Christian hands  you are a hypocrite.,?
11615,Charm generally has a "best before date."  It quickly fades and is replaced by the need for integrity and credibility.  If people perceive these are lacking all the charm in the world can't save you.,?
11616,Another reason why death is the only solution for lowlifes like this. I'm hoping they all crash and burn to their death  of course without taking innocents with them.,?
11617,Because that way the tax plan is even more stupid and guaranteed to fail.,?
11618,But Columbus died of syphilis with a gaping hole where his nose used to be. He was a child rapist  mass murderer and slaver. To me as a Native  his ideals of conquest  theft and murder against Natives  is used by our corrupt government against other countries and is the reason America was attacked on 9/11,?
11619,So  jail is the answer? Lets rebuild people. This person is just a millennial who did something stupid . Cost money to put them in jail. Think outside the box and get positive results.,?
11620,Liberals are broken people who destroy everything they touch...,?
11621,the ignorance of the media continues even after the spanking they took with trump  its not shtick  its REALITY!,?
11622,Yet you clearly judge others without merit.  I call that hypocritical. Stop condemning others.,?
11623,Heed the warnings D.C. job seekers....  Trump historically has underpaid or not paid workers for work done. We are not talking about unions  but include smaller business owners and workers who cannot afford litigation or the financial loss of not being adequately paid. Those who have sued often have to settle for a fraction of what is owed to them  or the settlement is sealed  with no admission of wrong doing. Trump has also underpaid real estate agents and his own attorneys  who took him to court. Trump has had thousands of lawsuits filed against him.  Sad how anyone could trust a guy like this who constantly screws over it's workers.,?
11624,You mean like Hillary's husband that she's covered for and ruined the lives of the women he sexually assaulted? Can't attack one without the other. They're both crap.,?
11625,Nelson Mandela - Economic Transformation = keep SA from falling off the cliff; Thabo Mbeki - Economic Transformation = ANC wants to take from the whites what they have; Jacob Zuma - Radical Economic Transformation = ANC wants future earnings of poor people from them  (steal from any South African  even if they poor - especially if they are poor).,?
11626,That free will will kill you!,?
11627,That bastard  Eddie Lampert  should be drawn and quartered!  My spouse will soon lose the pension he worked damn hard for.  Also  Sears Registered Retirement Plan was mandatory. We've just simply lost faith in everything.,?
11628,Trump won't give a shit about Canada.  A far right President and a far left P.M. It's chalk and cheese.  If NAFTA is open  it will end with a U.S. advantage. The milk lobby is already lobbying Trump's team to force us to get rid of our supply management system.  Carbon taxes here; no carbon taxes in the U.S. That  immediately  puts our businesses at a disadvantage with Trudeau unlikely to respond. Combined Provincial + Federal corporate tax in Canada is approx. 27%. Trump will lower U.S. corporate tax to 15%. Another disadvantage for us. And in Ontario  we have a hapless left-wing Gov't raising hydro prices to record levels  while just over the border in the U.S.  they're a fraction of the cost. Advantage US.  Trump is going to eat us for lunch because we are now run by left-wing Socialist morons with no business sense who see the giant iceberg up ahead but refuse on political principal to steer the ship in any other direction.  Get your life preservers on and get ready for the impact!,?
11629,Amen to that  Ron,?
11630,'oldvalleyguy' Your screen name says it all for me.  God forbid it happens to someone in your family and I promise you will sing a different tune.  Whether they be Black  White  Hispanic  or Other.  Resisting arrest does not give anyone the right to shoot an unarmed individual at point blank range.  You sir are a jerk and that is being kind!,?
11631,More Russian (and troll) whining...all these wanna-be Bolsheviks have to do to return to civilization is give up their ridiculous imperial project and stop pandering to the homophobia  anti-Semitism and racial prejudices of their Orthodox 'hierarchy' - and the KGB clown in the Kremlin.,?

11635,White washing the real problem.  We have a totally incompetent Honolulu Fire Department. Even the Three Stooges would do a better job.  Shibai and covering up the idiots who are in charge.  Caldwell should resign immediately and let the voters get someone else to run the City.,?
11636,perhaps jealous losers like you should mind your own dam business and stop crying about things that are meaningless and focus on your own lives,?
11637,Imagine if a Republican addressed the current president by the color of his skin as you just did.  You are the epitome of hypocrisy and the shame of it you don't even realize it!,?
11638,Kill the bears and stop the slaughter of humans.,?
11639,Based on the widely circulated eye-witness account of the (himself armed) guitarist Caleb Keeter - in which he recanted his life-long opposition to gun control after BEING in that situation and finding his own gun useless.   This was a country music show in America. Country music - the stuff gun nuts all listen to  the stuff they blare when they walk into family restaurants with an AR-15 slung to their backs and say they are excercising their "rights"*. There were probably more guns in the crowd than in Paddock's hotel room.  *I put rights in quotes because even in America you don't have a right to carry a gun onto somebody else's private property without their permission. Open-Carry laws don't actually mean the owner of the local McDonalds has to allow you to scare kids with your massive penis-extension hanging out. Indeed  any SANE restaurant owner would call the cops thinking he is about to be the victim of an armed robbery - and if a black man does it  you KNOW he will.,?
11640,Like a lot of people  Jonah misses the point and the joke of the "female genitalia hats." The marchers were wearing kitty-cat ears. They were responding to our our President  who used a vulgar term to refer female genitalia.,?
11641,Oh  brother.  Jason  read Kaplan's   Inua  Spirit World of the Bering Sea Eskimos.  Upon contact all wild  renewable resources were here..  You make me chuckle and think of cane toads. Google cane toads and see what those "all-wise  educated scientists  economists did regarding sugar cane. By the way  Alaska Natives harvest less then 2-2 % of the wild  renewable resources.,?
11642,The story didn't  say what ages these guys were. Teenagers could be 18 or 19 years old which means they may be on their own and renting the house. My first thought tho was where are the parents. Why are the up on a Tue night having a party quiet or not? I don't think any of this has been announced yet has it?,?
11643,I hope they all get tested for STDs,?

11648,"The division pays about $1 million a year into state Public Employees Retirement System to cover pensions for current and past employees  and those cost are expected to increase dramatically over the next four or five years."  To heck with public health and sanitation - the bottomless PERS pit must be filled!  Government has its priorities :  1. keep the unsustainable  ever-growing government labor union pockets filled.  2. whatever else.,?
11649,Yeah  those senior citizens constituents look so very scary. Cory Gardner is a coward!,?
11650,Well that's the dumbest thing i've read today.,?
11651,You got it right there  Rambler. I  too was once homeless. Today  I would not take  the young homeless me in  nor give money.   The young me didn't need it. I needed to get off my lazy ass.,?
11652,a_r:  Your concern is well founded.  We need to know much more about what is and is not in this proposal before we judge it.  Too bad we didn't do that first time around.,?
11653,If emotion plays no valid part in any decision  then we don't need national parks  national monuments  or scenic overlooks  or anything else that exists only because we 'love' it.  Reduce everything to numbers and dollars.  No thanks.  That's not how my America works- not until now  anyway.  The horses aren't starving.  MOST of the herds are just fine.  Fit and fat.  Do some research and you'll see the pics of the horses now being gathered.  Not a skinny one in the bunch- and the bunch is made up of thousands of horses.  The 'starving horse' routine if pure propaganda.  There are other solutions that work  and are more desirable in every single way than mass shootings or slaughter of thousands of perfectly fine horses.,?
11654,' …that comment is asinine. .,?
11655,None of this matters in my opinion unless they fix the Wednesday night game problem.  Move the games earlier on Saturdays.  Student safety and academics come FIRST!  Who cares how many tiers there are  how it's combined  etc. if the kids are out on a school night until midnight?  Like mapk96 says  the vast majority of these players will not play in college  much less go pro.  The only way to future success is through getting an education.,?
11656,Obviously fake news. Dead guy is source of story. Dead guy denies any Trump involvement weeks before death. Guy from England hints of references to (but no direct link to) Trump. Stupid on its face. FAKE,?
11657,What the hell are you idiots thinking?  We're moving to Colorado in a couple months  I ride a motorcycle  and this scares the crap out of me.  It's bad enough riding near texters where it's illegal - this is idiocy.,?
11658,We are suckers in this country. -------------------  but we are not born suckers we were made suckers by the leftist progressives,?
11659,So many right wing conspiracies and just false facts in there.  I would refute them but honestly  it won't matter to you  and anyone with any reasonable brain knows that what you state is just complete hogwash and has been proven wrong time and time again.  Does it ever get tiring being on the wrong side of history?,?
11660,Those are not the rates I'm seeing.  The rate I see is that Alaska graduates 72% of her students.  https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2015/02/12/latest-high-school-graduation-rates-state-by-state/ With our grad rates improving from 68% in 2011 to 72% in 2013.  Where are you getting your numbers?  That's better than Nevada  Oregon  and Louisiana.   The increasing funds are to pay for the medical coverage rates that Alaska doctors and hospitals are charging to provide medical to the education employees.  All industries in Alaska are dealing with that issue; yet you want to single out the public education system.    Why is that?,?
11661,That's for the PMO to answer to... not Khalid.  All she's done is write a non-binding motion in Parliament and since then has received a steady stream of death threats for her trouble.  She doesn't have the power to compel the PMO to agree with her.,?
11662,Yeah Adam lefabre or Rick   I got one but I have to say that everything on their was 100 percent true it talks about actual issues !! Not like your bosses hit pieces djou is going to erase social security ? Kirk supports social Security all absolute lies ! Praying on the senior from your focus groups and telling them things that the mayor has no control of  what blatant lies !!! But that's what kirk does on 2012 they said cayatano let murderer and rapist out from prison .. what a dirty guy,?
11663,Pulling out sucks.,?
11664,We all know that Trump is not very articulate. But is this really such an important issue that it requires all this coverage (15 minutes on Wolf on CNN last night). It is pathetic.,?
11665,HNL airport is far inferior compared to US  and foreign airports which have significantly more travelers.      It is poorly maintained and restrooms are usually a mess.    Food and souvenir prices are a ripoff.     The wiki wiki shuttle is a joke when compared to the automated forms of travel elsewhere.   For all the money that was spent it's a disgrace to local and visitors.,?
11666,"And the beat goes on..."  Cognitive dissonance.  Causal repetition.  I think there's a cream for that at Long's.  Topical only  mind you.  Collusion is an illusion.  Hilary will get indicted way before our President does.  Reason being is Hilary broke laws.  The Clinton Foundation broke laws.  Our President?  Don't thinks so.  But.....Obama didn't do anything  either.  Right?  Yeah.  Right.,?
11667,Feb 29th 1504 was a good day for Christopher Columbus too. For several months the famous explorer had been marooned on the island of Jamaica. He had been greeted warmly by the natives who helped him and his vast ship and crew survive in the foreign land by providing food and guides etc. However his arrogance and disrespect for the people had caused them to stop this gesture of goodwill. Cause  you know  he was being a dick.  Outraged by this  Columbus consulted his shipboard almanac to ask if there was anything he could use to trick the natives. As it happens  there was a lunar eclipse coming up. On the 29th feb  the day of the eclipse  he gathered the natives and told them that god was angry for their disrespect and would take away the sun. Disappearing inside his ship during the eclipse  he waited as the good people begged for their women and children. He agreed to 'bring the sun back'  and essentially enslaved the people until he was rescued.  WHAT A DICK.  happy leap year,?
11668,When you are told to be stupid  your brother is rapists  your son is criminals  your daughter is a sex worker.  It is a national pride and international reputation. Contributing or profiting from building this wall is to acknowledge the Great USA is right  you are 3rd class citizens.,?
11669,Actually  it is- which is why extreme and bizarre events have been occurring at record rates all around the world.,?

11674,wow you are ignorant  the us government works WITH those governments to see if docs are genuine   thus without a reliable functioning government the us government can not properly vet them.,?

11676,Another unintellible sentence only recognizable for its racist comment unrelated to the facts of the article.  "...these place that's always been???..."?  How stupid can you get?,?
11677,Cannot think of a single person of Irish descent that I personally know who isn't an honest  trustworthy salt of the earth character.  Where do the television networks find these reprobates like O'Dreary and O'Really ?,?
11678,Agreed  he is not like you.  And perhaps apology for his choice of words would have been the better choice.  But I can understand his reaction to the criticism coming primarily from a democratic congressional representative who inserted her interpretation of Trump's words.  The democratic congressional rep had no standing and should have made no comment.  Trump's response was likely directed towards her rather than the intended recipient of the call.  See the difference?  It was only later that the media got the actual recipient to comment.,?
11679,It seems pretty simple to me: players have a "right" to protest (if their employer is fine with it)  we as consumers (including VP) have right to not consume the product.  NFL  ball is in your court.,?
11680,Lots of ignorance in your post...but.. The Taliban refused to hand over any Al-Qaeda suspects including Bin Laden. They called Al-Qaeda their brothers in arms. And since when are the Taliban heroes of left-wing values? Go ask for their views on women.,?
11681,Term Limits  Every one of these clowns who voted for this Bill (SB 128) need to be thrown out of office. Thank the PUBLIC EMPLOYEE UNIONS and the OIL COMPANIES. It becomes harder and harder to distinguish between Republican and Democrat's as they are both RESPONSIBLE FOR BANKRUPTING THE STATE.,?
11682,Lets say the cost per unit is $10 000. We are looking at 200 million. That is a lot  but if it can be spread out over ten years  its doable. As to Port's comments  not doing something in the name of safety because its not the full enchilada makes no sense to me. Sometimes you have to take baby steps. besides  the point of sprinklers is not only to protect the residents in eh unit where the fire occurs  but to stop the fire from spreading to neighboring units. That is not an issue with single family homes.,?
11683,That's because some moved onto a new branch called the Black Gangster Disciples.. The bloods and crips aren't mandated like a charter club or MC.   They don't have a type of branch of rules except for some of the core basics. A lot of individuals always considered the gangs in Alaska to be more of the "wannabe" types as you put it  (again that's my thoughts on kids wanting or needing to belong to some particular group that gives them acceptance and recognition.) because they didn't fight or handle the streets in the same manor as the west coast originals.    The same can be said of the hells angels that still reside in Alaska and the few who worked n owned the Bush Company.   Those weren't just normal bouncers I'm sorry to say & that's how that kid ended up dead across the street some years back.  A gang is nothing more than a group of individuals who pledge themselves to a type of service  for purposes of a sometimes unknown sort  to benefit all said members. Ex. LEOs,?
11684,Destroy the planet for short-term greed and profit  and suck in the kickbacks. You are looking at the most corrupt government in our history. The serve the bidding of the great Evil.,?
11685,I don't disagree  but the topic here is the price of commercial real estate in downtown Calgary.  Have NDP policies been the primary force behind the dive in commerical real estate in downtown Calgary  or has it been the price of oil?  I would weight the price of oil at about 95% and NDP policies at about 5%.  Also I think you are underestimating the Alberta voter.  The overwhelming majority of NDP voters knew exactly what they were doing  and it was because they no longer trusted the conservatives after Stelmach and Redford.  I am very much a conservative and I think you are missing the point.  We blew it and we blew it very badly.  Then we couldn't even find enough common ground to form a single party and we split the vote.  If we need to find someone to blame for the loss to the NDP  then as Prentice so famously said  we need to look in the mirror.,?
11686,Your saying "math serves the family" is  as I said  inane. You have neither the honesty nor the maturity to admit that you said something stupid. Your attempt to double down on it makes you look even more stupid and less honest.,?
11687,Yay! We're on our way to a dick-tator-ship! All you Trumpeteers ready to fall in line? What? You have been since the beginning? How did we win here? What is the win here? Signed: Getting Schooled in Fascist Government.......do you like the New America?,?

11692,Trump's bounce was very small. At 1.1% it within the margin of error. Pathetic.,?
11693,Yes he has been in office for almost 100 days and what the hell has he done except use tax payer dollars to go on trips to Florida to play golf.  He makes Obama look like a tightwad.   And what exactly do you want to Donald to get done?   Lob more bombs into countries halfway around the world?  Build a stupiod wall?  Transform America into Orwell's Oceania?  This phony is so out of his league it is pathetic.,?
11694,Several pipelines got approved  including the Original Keystone and the Alberta Clipper. Do try to be honest...,?
11695,Wait...so factual data shows that banks are doing better than ever in many ways  but lobbyists want regulations removed because they are "too burdensome" ? Sounds like private interest deciding public policy to me.,?
11696,Globe and Mail:  Shame on you for publishing this anti-American filth. ▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀  Most decent Canadians congratulate President Donald Trump  and wish him Godspeed in restoring America's greatness.,?

11699,This is exactly what complacent Canadians  with uninformed political awareness  voted for. Shame!,?
11700,Sorry  genius  but you could not govern Rome without the support of the populus; even the Praetorians weren't stupid enough to try.   They kept their fingers in the wind too.   Rome didn't fall  it went broke; it could no longer provide for both the mob and the Legions after Roman Africa  Rome's breadbasket  fell to the Vandals.   You had the winning combination of crony capitalism trying to hold the African rent farmers harmless and the Roman/Ravennan power elite trying to keep the mob from ripping them to shreds by trying to provide for them with dwindling wealth.   Sounds a lot like the US today.   The Gibbons' meme is just Christian "moral failing" propaganda; the end of the Western Roman Empire was just real politic.   And f*ck you over the Oral Roberts U  stuff  you're just another arrogant leftist pr*ck.   Now your lefty "peers" will save you from this comment.,?

11707,On November 12  1963  Senator Wayne Morse (of Eugene ...) was told by President Kennedy in a White House meeting that he had decided to pull out of Vietnam.  A week and a half later  JFK was removed from office and his withdrawal order ("NSAM 263") was immediately reversed by the new President.  Imagine the world we would be in if the War on Vietnam had ended in Kennedy's second term and the resources for that atrocity had been reallocated for peaceful purposes.  No 58 thousand US soldiers killed.  No three million others killed.  The divisiveness here in this country largely avoided.  There are less destructive ways to repair broken family relationships than admiring people in a war zone.  link to primary sources:  www.jfkmoon.org/vietnam.html,?
11708,Useless idiot has been in office for 19 weeks and hasn't done a damn thing that has been positive. I pray everyday for some divine intervention because Congress is ruled by invertebrates.,?
11709,given you can not provide any argument never mind facts to show anyone is wrong  given you jump immediately to personal insults when you cant make any argument shows that in reality you are in deed the worst example of the left society does not need. grow up child. its sad that on forums as this so many like you living in blind hate get to post  so you are no longer worthy of anyone replying to  you post hate and insults nothing else. no sense given any credit by further interaction with someone living from such a pathetic level.,?

11714,Trump is creating nothing   There may be uncertainty in the PM's office but I can't believe there is chaos. .  It's the media that are trying to stoke the fires of chaos with articles like this.  Remember when Trump was first elected their exaggerated  reports  that his office was in chaos .   There is nothing the media like better than causing trouble  so they can  delight in reporting it.,?
11715,Maybe he no like work. No kan red watch or clok  no can unnerstan bus skeduals  like da fresh outsid ayah  miss hiz baby  lik sleep ona sidewok. Only dumb kine people end up in prison. No cure for stupidity.,?

11717,While we're still lifelong die-hard Broncos fans  we've definitely gone from full-on enjoyment of the NFL to about 70-30.  We still enjoy it more than we're annoyed by it  but it's definitely tainted now.    One of the great things about watching NFL games was as an ESCAPE from all the political crap in the news.  Now that political crap has infected the NFL like a cancer.,?
11718,Sounds like Ohio Dan longs for the good old days of 2015 when all he had to do was rant about Obamacare for three hours. Sorry Dan  not good enough anymore. You have to justify your support for the "American Health Care Act" which is 1000 times worse for Alaskans!,?

Why don't you come to my house in Elma Washington and say that to my face I'm an old guy but I'll pound you into dirt,?
11724,What an unbelievably useless comment for a unbelievable topic for the newspaper to write about...,?
11725,$1000 bail oooo did she know someone to get off that easy    she can pay the bondsmen $100 bucks and be driving the same night what a bunch of crap,?
11726,Well done  Mr. Sidhu!,?
11727,If this lowlife worm ever gets out and hurts or kills someone else again it should be open season on him.,?
11728,Simply grow your own  or pay the tax and stop whining. The extra revenue will help  because it certainly won't be spent on mythical "overdoses" or training hillbilly barney fifes to recognize weed. Lord have mercy  we are being led by morons...,?
11729,Has any Democrat denounced or repudiate Hillary in the strongest terms possible because she lied about her handling of national security?  Any denouncing and repudiating on her lying to mourning family members who died with their blood on Hillary's hands?  Any denouncing and repudiating on how she attached victims of sexual assault at the hands of her husband?  It amazes me how some can be so outraged about a stupid comment by the Trumpster and then lose their moral compass and common sense when it comes to Hillary.  Trump is bad  Hillary is worse.  What a mess.,?
11730,In reality Wyatt is an idiot.,?

11733,Ha ha ha ha ha Nice gesture! I wonder who will get this position and pocket these funds and nothing get done!,?
11734,The allegations being he hired some prostitutes and had kinky sex while being filmed by Russian spies? Clinton got a blow-job in the Oval Office from an aide while he was President. I am sure Trump is shaking in his boots!,?
11735,what's to disagree with here? cops belong in prison for this sort of crap. someone's life was lost.,?
11736,Yet Pence is the guy you lefties want to be president ASAP.,?
11737,Sigh.  Several billion people around the world are huge fans of this sport.  If you don't like it  don't watch.,?
11738,Strange how they only mention 3 of the big banks being under water. What about the others? Did they receive any bail out money - since they are not mentioned?  I think the poorly written piece would like you to think so  but you will find they probably didn't. .,?
11739,Aye  but that seems to organize threads by the age of the original post  not the subsequent ones.  Case in point  you posted your reply in this thread 4 minutes ago  but it is still listed based on Andree McLeod's original post.,?
11740,There seems to be a need for massive security  ($10 000 00+ at Sussex if done the way they want) yet security arrangements for the pm is fine at the current residence  Unless someone can say that security at the current temporary residence is costing say $1 million a month  perhaps there is an unrealistic need to spend so much on any Reno  All in all though  the place is neither historically or architectural significant  Start freshly.,?
11741,If Pierre can identify as Pierette  and Jane identify as John  and Taylor identify as "zhe"  then Joseph Boyden can identify whatever way he wants.  You too  Melanie; no need to say you "failed".,?
11742,What an stupid argument! Our reference is the Holy Bible  tradition and the Catholic Cathecism! It doesn't mean Catholic Church be a museum at all! Sin is always sin! Divorce was always hated by Jesus! Jesus says 15 times that there is a risk of eternal damnation if someone persists in a grave sin  while Amoris Laetitia 297 claims that no one can be condemned forever because it is not the logic of the Gospel. Thus  eternal damnation would seem to have become a heresy.,?
11743,Byron York.. trying out for the position of Billy Kristol.. these Establishment fools will die long before the American public believes a word of the Trump BS Dossier!,?
11744,Yeah and when Trump gets his ass handed to him by The Hildabeast It'll all be Cruz's fault....,?
11745,Wow. Obama actually had a brain and made common sense decision  especially in dealing with other foreign governments. As this article states on line 1  Obama will down as one of the greatest presidents partly because his success at foreign policy. Trump will possibly go down as the biggest fool and idiot ever to sit in the white house.  http://www.worldpolicy.org/blog/2016/01/12/obamas-success-foreign-policy,?
11746,Dr Demento  you're absolutely correct. Trump loves the attention and what does the media do? Give him more of it. I recently looked at the CNN app on my phone and every headline had the word "Trump" in it. The media really are suckers.,?
11747,The thing is  Trump is telling the truth about very fake news CNN. The leftists will disagree  of course  because they believe the lies that have been going on 24/7/365 about Russia collusion  etc. Even after almost a year with no evidence  some in the MSM continue to think it's a story  even after CNN admits there's nothing there.   What a shameful time for the media and the Democrats. I'm embarrassed for them.,?
11748,excellent illustration of the stupidity being demonstrated throughout western societies....trophies for all,?
11749,Yawn   back to your hole  Liberal shill.,?
11750,Really?  He's 18 years old.  He should be held accountable for HIS OWN ACTIONS.  Its not his parents fault that this idiot killed a poor lady and her sweet dog.  HE DID IT.  Good Lord Thelma.  You cant force anybody to get the help they do not want.  Come join us all in the real world.,?
11751,Troublesome worry and concern about every living things in the path of this storm. Praying all come out of it with little or no astronomical damages or loss of lives  animals or human beings!,?
11752,Wow no kidding eh. And junior and Marneau have all their money hidden offshore and  numbered companies. Now they will tax the the pot smokers and bless the black market.  Idiot savants screwing Canadian for their benefit and the Liberal media.,?
11753,The stupids proceed as though nobody will suffer except their intended victim.  They can't get much more stupid than that.,?
11754,That is not the biblical meaning of 'cross'.   It is not by means of personal suffering that we 'win' that 'crown'  but by love of our fellows.  Who put you in love with suffering? Mother Theresa?,?
11755,trumka should never have associated with that nasty pile of garbage who's been a union-buster  scab-employer his entire business life  Donald Trump is "their man" because he  nearly alone  is anti-union in Vegas. he alone has been as hostile to the right to organize as anyone  Trumka had plenty of reasons before to tell that pile of garbage to drop dead,?
11756,“I know ” Reed replies. “Trust me. Do you know why he challenged you to a duel? ‘Cause you could beat the s- out of him.”  They both agree Cheetolini is crazy AND COMPLETELY STUPID ... WORKING ACROSS THE AISLE I LOVE IT!!  ;),?
11757,I guess our Charter needs to add 'freedom from religion' as a right  OR stop giving property tax exemptions to religious institutions who still need to use the public infrastructure that they are not obliged to pay for.  How about equality for all taxpayers and social groups who band together for non-religious interests? I really don't like to see any religion pushing its way into the public domain  certainly not into schools.  Ontario needs ONE public education system for its students so they learn to work together while studying modern curricula. Never mind dividing the boys and girls into separate groups according to beliefs from hundreds to thousands of years ago. Where are most wars happening in the world right now  and what is driving them? Religion is defined as a denomination  and the definition of 'denominator' is divider. We don't need to make such division a part of the public sphere or education in Canada.,?
11758,So she can dish all the obscene trash she wants and hide behind her 1st amendment right but when people (Trump's family) call her out she say they're bullying her?  Hahahaha!   What a snowflake princess.  LOCK HER UGLY FACE UP RIGHT NEXT TO CROOKED HILLARY!,?

11762,Well stated Ms. Hood.,?
11763,Disgusting. You seem to think that you can simply run down the clock of living memory on this rolling ongoing catastrophe of the fascistic nuclear military-industrial complex. We're not going to let you fascists succeed in scrubbing history to the detriment of humanity  justice  and equality. Your profound immorality is laid bare under God's sunlight for all the public to witness. Shouldn't you do something to make amends for your bottomless shame? (anti-censorship Repost x2),?
11764,"No you didn't  you had insurance". How in the hell do you know what I did or didn't do? I had a major medical plan which at the time was dirt cheap and only covered major health issues which my the way I never collect a dime on. In my opinion insurance was design to cover sizable and unexpected financial loses  that is what my homeowners and auto policies are for  health insurance shouldn't cover every little boo-boo you might get in your daily lives  at least I don't think I should be forced to purchase insurance that does just that.,?
11765,Typical stupid legislature writing incomplete laws. How does CO or WA handle this?,?
11766,I used to shop a lot at Saks online  but their service has seriously deteriorated since they were bought by HBC..During the run up to Christmas  wait times to speak to an agent were upwards of 20 minutes  and that took you to a call center in the Philipines where the method of problem resolution is to hang up on the customer and make them wait another 20 minutes.  I have been waiting two weeks for a credit to be put back on my credit card. I called about it last week and as usual was disconnected by the agent overseas. I also tried pressing two for service in french  and was automatically disconnected three times before giving up.  Much prefer Nordstrom's.,?
11767,Daniel  Texas has so many oil and gas operations because the land owner owns the subsurface mineral rights. In Alaska  the state owns the subsurface rights  except on Alaska Native lands and a small number of pre-statehood mining claims. Texas also restricts exploration in a number of locations  starting with the Alamo. Your sole focus is how to make Donkel and associates wealthy in your Florida based corporation.,?
11768,It has long been known that the farmers you try to help during the day are the same terrorist trying to kill you at night. Al  Qaeda  Taliban  ISIS  Iran Iraq  they are all the same. ...really. And as we're are seeing now  they are in Canada as refugees.,?
11769,It does not matter if she is right or wrong since simply being off message is now a social crime in Canada.,?
11770,Putin the dumb. Bad moves on his part. He needs to be fired.,?
11771,Fucking bullshit. "Best care available"  lock up the seaworld trainers  around metal walls in a crammy room. FFS Tilikum only attacked due to stress  when he and his other fellow whales do not preform well doing rehearsals  they are not fed  in which the other whales attack Tilikum for some food  raking him with their teeth. And his dorsal fin? A healthy whale's fin is straight  not floppy. To hell with the trainers he killed  they deserved that shit.,?
11772,I don't eat fresh fruit and vegetables  so very low risk for me.  I do eat a lot of red meat though  so I'm probably more at risk of "mad cow" and other ailments tied to the consumption of meat products.,?
11773,I support a state income tax. Those of us who earn a good living off of the bounty of Alaska have a duty to contribute to the civil infrastructure that makes possible a thriving economy.,?
11774,You simply cannot place yourself into the mind of someone who is troubled enough even to contemplate "death by cop."  Police have the sacred mission to protect the public: this guy was a potentially lethal threat. It doesn't matter to a cop's widow if the "crazy" guy always had been non-violent or if he really didn't know what he was doing at that time. Cops have a reasonable expectation that they will go home to their wives and loved ones. If it's you or they  it's no choice at all. It isn't fair to ask for more from a human being. The gun wielding nutcase opens a door. What walks through isn't always within his control. Thank goodness no "innocent" person was killed  though I do feel sympathy for the cop who has this on his conscience. Why didn't this idiot just turn the weapon on himself?,?
11775,Sad to say  the problem with America is we spend way too much on crap like the military and prison industrial complexes.  Come on Donald release your tax returns so that we can see how you and your family will benefit!  Coward.   Perhaps then phony conservatives may look at ways to stop this wasteful spending.,?
11776,That looks absolutely delicious!,?
11777,Interesting how your tune changes when a certain event happens to you.  It is better to try to have empathy and try to understand others and their situations by putting yourself in their shoes because you never know when you will be wearing their same shoes.  Happens all the time.,?
11778,Is there really a train from Seward to Whittier in the middle of the night?,?
11779,I'll continue to forgive Hilary as long as she keeps bashing Trump. Smash  bash  trash till the cows come home  Hillary.,?
11780,Like our Liberal PM doing a Vogue shoot  jogging by people topless  wearing fancy socks  showing up at children's WE Day events  showing up at rock concerts  doing talk shows south of the border  flitting around the world for any photo op he can get  being known as the selfie PM...........THAT kind of new coverage?,?
11781,I take it you Voted for the Liberal Loser Hillary   of the Clinton Crime Family !,?
11782,It remains difficult to understand how the auto  manufacturing will continue to be a mjoy employer in the mid to long range future regardless of locating in Canada  the USA  or Mexico..  specifically the primary function of the automakers is to male a profit for their shareholders and to operate in an efficient  effective  and economical manner whilst doing so.  President elect Trump's offorts to  tilt the tables in favour of the USA manufacturing of vehicles is an attractive short-term proposition  it will inevitably result in being an expensive and retrograde proposition.  The relentless march of artificial intelligence will claim every job that can be done by machines at lesser cost than human labour  regardless of wherever  in the world the production takes place.  We can see the future of all manufacturing and it doesn't include too many of us in the equation.,?
11783,Like which ones? KKK? Republicans?,?
11784,Good to know just how racist and ignorant you are. Somewhere in the US may well suit you. And you can use the profits from selling your home to pay for healthcare.,?
11785,Way to go  Globe and Mail!   What an invitation to get engaged in civic life! Among other things  you get to wear the label of "oddball and obsessive" in a national newspaper for being a deputant in Toronto.  And really  I would suggest that a paper really interested in "progressive" social issues would stay away from labelling groups of people in this way.   It's just not cool.  Try running this article through your "prejudice" screens and see how it fares.,?
11786,You'll have to excuse me if I don't believe in your ability to spot a liar.,?
11787,Rogers Communications must love fans like you. Doesn't matter what team they throw on the field you love them  and when winning a game is but a dream.....it's the umpire's fault.,?
11788,I happened to be there today  and it's an absolute madhouse. Campers with empty trailers in every wide spot in the road  let alone actual pullouts. The state gravel pits are the worst  including one that looked like a small town at about mile 110. Just complete nonsense. I can't imagine there are many legal animals left alive within *miles* of the highway.  Something needs to be done about this--no idea what.,?
11789,They should also release a list of the stupidest things police officers have done.,?
11790,What a hypocrite!  He sat in parliament and helped to squash the first case of corruption when Nosazana Dlamini-Zuma gave money to her pal Ngema in the Sarafina 2 scandal  while Nelson Mandela did nothing.   The die was cast when Mr Naidoo and his cohorts chose to turn a blind eye to corruption.,?
11791,You sound like a Russian bot created on a troll farm in order to spout fake news comments.,?
11792,Why is Vance Joseph still the coach this morning?,?
11793,He's been a bumbling fool in every political role he's had.,?
11794,We the people need to take on scum like this.  Don't you dare!  So we had to stomach 8 years of anti-American BS (peacefully) and now you expect us to be cowed???   NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.  We are not all dulls like your followers.  You have all been exposed so deal with it and come in line with society.,?
11795,I prefer the cops be paid a bounty on killing trash. A public service.,?
11796,Congrats on being an ignorant fool. Many psychologists do not take insurance at all. Those that do make contracts with insurance companies for reimbursement rates.  In fact  if you bothered to understand the ACA at all  you would know that it does not set the price of mental health services.,?
11797,ANOTHER fake news story spiked.  Will the lying media slime ever learn?,?
11798,Let's call it what it really is - just another CASH GRAB!,?
11799,Nothing more ideologically attractive than a "boot in the face" Mike. Truly stupid work.,?
11800,Kelly is gutting education because he wants everyone to be as ignorant and venal as he is  but without any means of economically bettering themselves.  After everyone who can has left the state  the remainder can function as his underpaid  underfed personal servants.  Frankly  Scarlet  Kelly doesn't give a damn.,?
11801,Your fake POTUS is the definition of a parody.,?
11802,Thank you for your patronizing tone  you bombastic  lying hypocrite.,?
11803,The countdowns should be moved to above the intersection and hooded  those are for drivers. They should be precise. The arterial routes should be for cars only  not for bikes or skateboarding. The streetcars do not belong on Toronto streets  phase them out and replace them with buses. Pedestrians who enter the intersection on red and block the turning vehicles should be heavily fined. All bike routes  whenever possible  should run one block off the main streets. All the construction access should be allowed only from the back streets/laneways.  Choke points like the bottom of Spadina need to be redesigned. That's just bare bones. We have sixties infrastructure and we're surprised we have gridlock. We don't build mass transit  but we expect people to leave their cars.  We build massive suburbs  farther and farther away and expect families to bike it. We're a stupid  stupid people.,?
11804,Maybe that will slow down the Native women seriel killer!!  #truth,?
11805,Commie suck up,?
11806,The republican party should oppose all racists including their own presumed nominee for president.,?
11807,Am I really the 1st female responder to this article? A big thank you to Denby for bringing this to the attention of your readers.  I haven't marched in protest since the Vietnam War in the 70's  motivated by my classmates being enlisted and killed in that hated war.  And now  nearly a half century later  we find ourselves in an equally torn America we don't recognize - one that voted an idiot into power because - why?  He has money and people think that will rub off on them? White supremacy that captures the imagination of more idiots parading around in their KKK robes? The unemployed who kid themselves into thinking the orange haired guy cares whether they feed their families?  People claiming 'change' as motivation when they really mean destroy everything the alt right doesn't like?  The Russian puppet-leader will not be allowed to remove women's rights as if we are at worst slaves and at best window dressing. If you want to see angry women just stay tuned as this disaster unfolds.,?
11808,I agree with your observation that Charlottesville was a "state sponsored riot" clearly facilitated by the Mayor  Police  Civic leaders  and Gov. McAwful. Their agenda was nakedly clear. To foment open violence and begin the non-stop race-baiting of the GOP. We witnessed the fact that despite hundreds  literally hundreds  of public felony assaults  virtually no one was arrested.  The DNC continues "The Resistance" to mobilize violence and to stop Free Speech. We saw the DNC playbook at Trump's Chicago rally in 2016  the Inauguration  in Berkeley  in Charlottesville  etc.   Yet the most effective methods to counter extreme messages like the KKK  etc. is to not attend their rallies. When they march in empty streets  to bellow taunts to no one  to rage against the air  and to lash out at nothing  it quickly eviscerates their "juice". Tragically  many groups I don't agree with have an absolute Free Speech right. It's why we have American Democracy. A fact the Left continues to debase.,?
11809,Unless the comparison is apt. Here's the 8chan/ thread Trump lifted his Hillary/Star of David meme from: http://archive.is/E0Dto It also features sentiments such as: "Death to all non-whites Hail Victory" and "Jews are two-faced backstabbers who aren't to be trusted" and refers to Hitler as "Uncle Adolf".  Recall he also retweeted this:   https://mobile.twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/690562515500032000?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw   from @WhiteGenocideTM (which Trump STILL hasn't taken down)  And he told the Republican Jewish Coalition: “You’re not going to support me  because I don’t want your money ” he said. “You want to control your own politician.”  Cant you connect the dots "Kalli"?? Or are pleased that a white supremacist will shortly be occupying the Oval Office?,?
11810,Ah yeah  I remember the  Primo Gardens.,?
11811,What a despicable low life human being. Eugene Terblanche was a nasty POS but this man and his ilk is fast taking over as the current time AWB.,?
11812,You know what  I do agree with you somewhat on that.  I agree that we haven't been pulling our weight  of that there is no doubt and it makes me ashamed as a Canadian.  What I do think we should do however is get a massive fleet (150) of Super Gripens (for half the cost of 65 F-35's) to put money towards four more submarines and two more destroyers.  If we can swing it  I'd even like to see a carrier or two.,?
11813,says a lefty loser of stupid  see pal  under harper we won and ran things great for years   we need more of that and will soon enough when we kick the kid and the libs to the curb   torys 43  libs 25 now federally..,?
11814,You sure you want to talk about "adults marching around"?  Women with stupid hats  'protestors' blocking highways and damaging property  etc might come up.  And 'bullying"-LOL. Ask Betsy DeVos about the current bullying and lack of courtesy. Kathy Griffin might have something to say  too  about setting examples for our children.  The inappropriate behavior we are currently seeing has no political boundaries.,?
11815,Liberalism is a cancer and that cancer must be excised from the Catholic Church.,?
11816,The PFD belongs to the PEOPLE of ALASKA. Not the Governor. Any fundamental changes to how the PFD is paid should be put to a referendum  for ALL Alaskans to vote on. Walker is an idiot and a fool--plain and simple. His obsession with chasing the LNG pipeline which is guaranteed to lose the State of Alaska billions has blinded him to reality. He just unilaterally taxed everybody in the state $1000 a head. What an absolute joke he has turned out to be. He needs to be recalled immediately  and his PFD grab/over-reach needs to overturned.  The PFD is NOT a piggy bank for him to control at his whim. And please--stop the scare tactics--" we need to cut it in half to save it  blah  blah blah". That is pure BULL##$%^t. Don't believe that nonsense for a minute. They need to ring every damn cent out of the Bloated state budget before they even think of touching the PFD. He's punishing everybody in Alaska because he can't get his way--like a petulant child. Don't let it happen people! OVERRIDE IT,?
11817,I speculate that there are 40 - 60% MORE magazines that hold more than 15 rounds in Colorado now than before the law went into effect.    It's had a disastrous side effect - prohibition doesn't work and only causes people to want it and hoard it.,?
11818,Telus service is 1000 times better than Shaw and they treat their employees very well. Great company!,?
11819,Isn't that the truth. It's easy to say when you have already given them your word you are leaving. My guess is she had several conversations in the last few days and not to many many were positive.,?
11820,Malema is a crook and a politician or is that a politician / crook?  Why give him space?,?
11821,You are correct  Skinut  you did not say form was more important than substance  but you implied it by focusing on how Trump appeared.  Actions are more important than how he appeared.  Judge him by how the Federal government response to the crisis and not by the cap he wears or the shoes Melania may wear.  After all  he is ultimately responsible for everything it does or fails to do.  Up to now the Federal government under Trump leadership deserves an A+ responding to the Harvey disaster.,?
11822,Nothing there at all - big disappointment for Democrats and the media trying to take down this president.,?
11823,For Boyle's angry condemnation of the 'stupidity and evil' of the Afghan-Taliban terrorists  I would like to hear him to first acknowledge  even just once  his own stupidity to go 'backpacking' in the well known dangerous territory with his pregnant wife. Dressing up his own reckless and stupid behavior as a humanitarian action just rings hollow to me.  His wife’s father anger of his irresponsible behavior echoed what is on many people’s mind.,?
11824,I guess it's insulting...if a man is as tender as the skin on his balls.   I guess anyone insulted by 'cuck' really needs a safe space.,?
11825,There seem to be a lot of Trumpsters in Alaska.  I can't understand why.  With the exception of a few nut cases gazing at Russia through their kitchen windows  most Alaskans seem pretty intelligent.   Perhaps their news is so filtered by passing through the great Canadian wilderness  that it is skewed.  However  the last time I was there  the internet seemed to work fine.  So  here goes.  Trump thinks you are idiots  and he can do or say anything  and you will still vote for him.,?
11826,Shame on George "I can't" Cope. I smell a class action lawsuit.,?
11827,Thats why we have temp foreign workers.   These "new immigrants" don't want to get their hands dirty.    The jobs are out there but so is socialistic parasite vote hungry government.,?
11828,so what do we do. Give in to Kim Un? Peace comes with a Prize. Our forefathers paid for and risked their lives for our Freedom!,?
11829,This is hopeful news for our state.  Will the granted kits and training reach beyond "law enforcement  medics  and nonprofits" to the community at large?  In particular  individuals who are likely to be first responders have the greatest opportunity to save a life in an overdose situation.,?
11830,obama is a fool,?
11831,O'Leary has been called an a**  and so touched one to see what it felt like.  8-;,?
11832,Why hasn't the RG had any reporting or photos of the UO during this storm?  History of sorts was made in that the UO closed down for two days in a row and had the majority of their employees stay home.  Why no articles in the paper about this?  It's almost as if a whole sub-city within the City of Eugene  the UO  doesn't exist any longer for the RG to report on.  What happened to Diane Dietz?  She has the UO beat  I expected to read something by her about the closings or the intense work being done by the Essential Services employees who showed up for work each day trying to fix and clean up the campus so it would be safe again.  Kudos to the Grounds crew  the Central Power Station employees  the DPS  and all other unnamed departments at the UO who reported to work each day during the storm.,?
11833,The Star Advertiser article provides  "Magician Raymond Sonnie Tavita  23  who suffers from spina bifida  wept with happiness Wednesday upon receiving two of the wheelchairs — one donated by owners of Aloha Kia and The Cab  and an electric one from Waianae resident Yvonne Whitehead. “I am truly blessed ” Tavita told the news media during a gathering at state Rep. John Mizuno’s office. “When my wheelchair was stolen  I was devastated. … These wheelchairs open up my life again.”  Once again Love and Aloha wins over hate an crime. This is the Hawaii we know - and the Love over 40 wheelchairs being donated to Rep. Mizuno's office - now can be donated to people with a disability that really need a wheelchair  but can't afford one. Truly a great ending to a story of hope and love.,?
11834,are you a fascist sheep man? you sure seem like one.,?
11835,Trump LOVES Putin's ass. He not only kisses it  he worships it.  In honor of Putin  Trump has begun to regularly show his own wrinkley ass to the public. Not pretty  but love makes us all do crazy things. Just not as totally cray-cray as Trump.,?
11836,Not the entire group.  See:  http://dbedt.hawaii.gov/hcda/authority-members/,?
11837,Steven  you worked yourself into a bit of an uncomfortable corner.  Since Trump got more college educated blacks than Romney and Hillary got more non-college educated blacks  are you really suggesting that college educated blacks are racists for voting for Trump? Or are you instead suggesting that these college educated blacks are effectively stupid  despite their college credentials  for voting for Trump.  Please work with the data a bit more and untangle your awkward conclusions.,?
11838,Good idea! More stupid laws.  Just what America - with its huge incarcerated population - needs.,?
11839,Foreskin is desperately trying to redeem his incredibly stupid decision to vote for the moronski in the White House.,?
11840,This is a dumb question when you have uninformed people answering without them being aware of how much it personally means to them as cash outlay in their household.,?
11841,....how about a tax increase for "Stupid Politicians"!  They are simply following the US Mainland models like NY  Oregon Washington Colorado  and SF  no creative thinking what so ever!  Off Grid.  Tomorrow SA Poll:  "Did you approve of Pres. Trump  Speech to the UN".  pssssst psssst. If they don't hold this poll you know the MSM doesn't want to admit that it that it was great. Watch!    Let me be the first and give you a Hell Yeah! This was the best speech ever made by a US President to the UN . IMUA President Trump  IMUA ! MAGA!,?
11842,This whole hullabaloo started with an article put out by the Jeff Bezos Washington Post that stated there was "good" intelligence to estimate that N. Korea had so many nuclear bombs and that it has perfected the miniaturization of the weapon to the top of one of it's missiles that purportedly on a proper trajectory could possibly hit an American land mass. Turns out the report  according to experts chiming in on it  was only half baked with the conclusions still up for serious debate. And taken off of that  our President blows up the conversation by using the language that is used in North Korean newscasts. (and some radically right wing Republican organizations). And then the fatso in North Korea ups that even more. At the end  all three of these clowns are winners of the ultimate babooze award. Because all of this  from the report to the bellicosity to the posturing  is only making fools out of them  and scaring the pants off the regular folk.,?
11843,Either you are Russian or incredibly dumb.,?

11848,Perhaps- but the question that ADN refuses to ask is  "why do they deserve all the credit  when thousands of people have contributed to the building and construction of the Alaska Highway?",?
11849,"Whos budget will be cut"? No one's silly. He has an unlimited supply of money. US! remember how it works? he needs money  we say "no". he says well then I have to cut police  fire  and medical care  to premature babies and old people. We panic and say "OK".,?

11851,I agree anyone not from alaska doesn't know our messed up laws. He well say he didn't mean it he was drunk but I'm sure he has years of abuse on women. The judge we'll feel sorry for the guy kick him in then it's and send him back into the world to kill again. Fuck sb91,?
11852,Where's the love bra?  I've been led to believe that you libwingers were all about love and tolerance but all I see is hate and death wishes.  As Taylor Swift says  Why ya gotta be so mean?    And I can see you years from now in a bar  Talking over a football game  With that same big loud opinion  But nobody's listening  Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things  Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing  But all you are is mean   All you are is mean  And a liar  and pathetic  and alone in life  And mean  and mean  and mean  and mean ..........,?
11853,Condolences to his family  they lost their son! Have a heart! Stop being a asshole and saying those ignorant comments!,?
11854,Spot on opiniated garbage. There's nothing factual about any of this other than what bills are on the table and who represents them. The rest is garbage.,?
11855,What if populism isn't the biggest menace?  What if it's elitist arrogance and stupidity?,?
11856,Feed your garbage to you potheads as you to sound like one. So we may meet one day over it.  It is communism and they do not deserve life.,?
11857,then don't expect special services,?
11858,That's why I asked. Go easy.,?

11860,You can`t "afford" something your not willing to pay for Dick. You should know that being a carpetbagging republican oil shill and all.,?
11861,I want more scientists and engineers in congress  and one of those types to president. They do what is right  logical  and will use reasoning instead of ideology to solve problems. They are just too smart to ever decide to do something so foolish.,?
11862,I'd be fired if I drove a state car to a place to drink  period  regardless of whether I got back into the car. The state does not play around when it comes to the use of DAS-owned cars. They even encourage that we park cars away from the front of bars to avoid even the appearance of impropriety. When we go to those establishments for state business  then it's allowed. If we're on travel status and we want to drink  then we need to be able to get there by walking or public transport.,?
11863,here we have ANOTHER muslim kook shooting us  and morons think trump is the problem for cleaning up our country. i can't wait till he starts exporting these freaks.,?
11864,Got to be more specific.  Like in Charlottesville or in Barcelona.  If it is Barcelona you are talking about  I see no reaction from left or right.  Americans are stupid about what happens overseas (although progressives are actually more aware).  Including Trump,?
11865,Children need supervision by their mothers.  These poor excuses of human garbage are incapable of being 'supervised' because they have no values except their personal hedonism.,?
11866,This is a much more straightforward analysis than you see most of the time in these columns.,?
11867,Agreed.  It's all about cheap labour  not skilled labour.  That's all these 'executives' care about.,?
11868,No reason why we can't finish in the top tier of our conference!  Returning coaching staff  returning OC  returning QB  returning RB (if he stays healthy he could be the OPOTY).  Love to hear knowledgeable fans comments.  Go Warriors!,?
11869,"trump is running circles around the Vatican." No what trump is doing is running circles around people just like YOU and laughing all the way to the bank.,?
11870,Wow. Hard to fathom the ongoing arrogance of the U.S in making this demand. The U.S. being a country whose presence in the region has cost hundreds of thousands of lives over the past almost 20 years. The problem is that Iraq is a made up country  made up by that eccentric map maker T.E. Lawrence. It strings together the Kurds in the north  the Sunni's in the center  around Baghdad and the Shia's in the south  around the port of Basra. Why was Iraq created?  To protect the oil that flows from fields in the north through pipelines  to the ports in the south.  Anything other than the loosest possible federation of autonomous regions will never work. But the U.S. keeps supporting strong corrupt central governments  dominated by one ethnic group or another  resulting in guaranteed  made in the U.S. State Department turmoil. Yankee go home.,?

11872,Yea  or yea  the Conservative deficits occurred under a MINORITY government. Once Harper got his Majority  the deficit was eliminated. Now Sunny Days is spending money like he was a rich kid born with a silver spoon in his mouth.,?
11873,Seneca's contract is fine; EWEB and the ratepayers are the one's losing money whenever it's  up and making electricity.     But your basic point is accurate.  Unless alternative energy is at least break-even  it won't be made.  No one can afford to lose money every single day without going out of business.    And there is no magic Federal or State money tree that is going to subsidize losing energy production forever.,?
11874,Yes the federal government should have stayed out of the health industry. There is no where in the constitution where it say the government should have anything to do with health or healthcare,?
11875,Trudeau speaks in progressive riddles and broad idealist puffery void of anything that could be considered a coherent message. His lobbying description is equivalent to suggesting sex with a condom doesn't count  he's embarrassing himself - Trudeau is regressing further into hypocrisy and ignorance by pretending that subscribing to a higher "progressive" moral authority gives him carte blanche to do whatever he wants. Just look at the climate deal  how much will it cost the average taxpayer? Eye rolls and contempt from Trudeau and Butts - don't ask questions  it's 2016  sunny ways and all that...,?
11876,Unfairly generalize much?,?
11877,Mr. Jenkins you should remain silent and be suspected of being a fool rather than opening your mouth and removing all doubt.,?
11878,Thank you for those people who actually shop at Walmart and need this guidance. Folks who shop at Walmart ain't too bright anyway. "Always the lowest price!" LOL  What a bunch of corporate bullsh!t lies. And also remember their signs all over the stores years ago: Made in America!?  LOL  another bucket of bullsh!t lies from typical corporate liars and predators.,?
11879,Get an education  right you allow an idiot to dictate what you think. You're another waste of skin.,?
11880,Kirk Cameron is definitely not a prominent public intellectual. Kirk Cameron is a religious nut job.,?
11881,2016 year of stupid for many people in the big house.,?
11882,Yep only an idiot would get rid of someone with 32 years of experience. That's why he doesn't know s--t. He got the cream of numbskulls as his advisors.,?
11883,Read there are two pakalolo bills in the leg.  They might get to checkout before medical marijuana's  in the state pharmacy.  No fed taxes!  Dumb tourists spending money foolishly on all sorts of overpriced trash. It'll be good for business. (Heehee.).,?
11884,that's the guy who wears that stupid cap which is tightening his brain............,?
11885,Russian troll alert  FYI: Russia is not a major country.  They are weak  poor  and have no allies of any worth.,?
11886,Ahahahahahahahahahahaha!,?
11887,'wax' or wane,?
11888,I do not think threatened is the correct definition but more like wanting suppression of the free exercise of a religion other than they practice if they so practice.  One should feel free to practice their chosen faith wherever and whenever they deem appropriate without the fear of offending   reprisal and/or injury or even death.  History has long shown us that when a religious portion of any given citizenry comes under the thumb of the non religious population of that very same citizenry horrible things happen. So many will say that this could never be the case in America. Guess again. It is happening and at an ever greater pace. When men feel as though they are not held accountable for their actions to a higher authority then all the evils of human race begin to rear it's ugly face.    Political correctness is the code word for suppression of free speech and other freedoms.,?
11889,I forgot Click Bishop  Steve Thompson  Mark Nueman  Lynn Gattis  Kevin Sadler  Bryce Edgemon  Tammy Wilson  etc. pathetic losers all of u. I forgot one but he's not old enough to drive yet. You belong in Debtors prison shackled to the walls.,?
11890,We should adopt Mexico's immigration laws.,?
11891,' Trump is a con man and a buffoon.  Nothing more.,?
11892,Why is it stupid?  The NSA hacked into Merkel's mobile phone under Obama.  That whole issue was dealt with behind closed doors. Why wouldn't the GCHQ try monitor Trump?,?
11893,What does that mean to Alaskans? --- nothing.  Our state makes ZERO off of our natural resources.  Alaska pays them to take our oil.  The people of our state benefit NOTHING from oil exploration.  In decades past it might have been exciting--now it causes resentment. Let them leave & go home.  Maybe it will save Alaska millions of dollars.,?
11894,trump is more unstable and lunatic than kim and putin. trump is the new axis of evil.,?

11896,I know  I'm a horrible bigoted  murdering oppressor by right of birth.   And Pol Pot  Edi Amin  and Chairman Mao must have been whites in disguise.,?
11897,As I understand it  the UBI is supposed to be global not country specific so I think we aren't quite on the same wave length in the discussion.  But Alaska's Permanent Fund Dividend may be an example of why a UBI won't work.  Take a look at the payouts and the issues with the fund on the Wiki page.  Additionally  what happens to the "Permanent" fund once the oil reserves become non-productive/run-out and Alaska burns through the fund?  As we have seen with PERS  investment income won't cut it for "permanent". https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Permanent_Fund,?
11898,Someone should tell this grade B actor that  some pollution is necessary to keep the liberal elites and wealthy in their huge homes  enjoying their heated swimming pools  guest homes  nannies quarters  big yachts  country clubs  executive golf courses etc. Maybe she should be lobbing her friends that have made a career out of polluting the environment and also in her case a lot of bad movies .. Why pick on the rest that are just trying to drive to work and heat their homes.,?

11901,So a fatal shooting involving four in Fort Collins  not to mention three more shot in west Denver and a disgruntled employee shooting of 6 in Maryland.  It doesn't look like lots and lots of guns are making us safer.,?
11902,Victoria Leon Guerrero is a stupid white girl who pretends to be a native Chamorro.  She also pretends to hold a PHD  when  in reality  she has a terminal masters degree and will never have a PHD.  Stop playing Dr. Chamorro and go back to being stupid white girl.,?
11903,Well everyone if you ever wanted to know how someone would speak  post or act while on fentanyl here is a prime example of it. Stupid? Of course but let him continue because if he plays his music you may just lose your turkey dinner.,?
11904,Bennet is an embarrassment both for Colorado  and the human race.,?
11905,Whistleblower laws being broken are difficult to prove and people don't want to lose/risk their jobs only to try to fight them in the courts for 1-2 years or longer with money they don't have. Unions help employees from being fired in the first place and are much more effective at helping employees feel empowered to speak up.   The GOP does not want empowered public employees which is why they're trying so hard to break unions. They want employees afraid to speak up while corporate interests fill the ranks and unethical behavior runs unchecked.,?
11906,Thank you for making championing my comments. A forensic audit is being asked which is independent and not the required one that happens  every four years but you know that. The LLC's which are to date claimed to be independent from OHA but are run buy staff then and now show that OHA still owns them  but you know that as well.  So then what do we have left here of course we must be out to get the CEO  after all theres nobody or activity above him that warrants investigation whether the law is broken or the money doesn't add up and is unaccounted for?  Right and the world is flat but you know that as well.,?
11907,Typical response from someone who is indoctrinated and has too much pride to act with intellectual honesty.  Condemnation without investigation is the height of Mt. Ignorance.   It is the mark of an intelligent mind to be able to entertain an idea without accepting it.,?
11908,but you are good with a left-wing religious zealot Omar Alghabra?  Hypocrisy is the word of the day,?
11909,Why the hell is Canada meddling in the internal affairs of Venezuela? Is Trudeau such an oblivious corporate lapdog that he barks on command?,?
11910,Look up Bill Clinton Impeachment you idiot.  He is a Democrat.,?
11911,Trump  sitting in Israel  states he 'just got back from the Middle East'.  http://media.crooksandliars.com/2017/05/36350.mp4_high.mp4,?
11912,common core math?,?
11913,I never made either assumption. Show me where I did.,?
11914,I would be surprised if this is a short-lived 'cooling down' period  after over 8 years of rock bottom interest rates and price increases far outpacing general inflation.  This could just be the beginning of a sharp correction  or at best prices could stagnate in a narrow range for a few years.  Trudeau had better be prepared for a drop in tax revenues  as real estate has accounted for up to a third of recent GDP growth.  Not only will his budget not balance itself  but the deficits may go even deeper (add a higher loonie  oil back down in the mid-40s and higher interest rates and it could be a perfect storm).,?
11915,It seems your back yard was unavailable  so a compromise was reached.   There's no need to fire Ruiz  he is doing what the council has directed. I can't speak for all the councilors but the three I've spoken with all say pretty much the same thing. Namely  citizens don't want the homeless in their neighborhoods and they do not want the city to divert much from the general fund towards services for the homeless. Judging from your previous posts  you are in agreement with this stance.,?
11916,Jeff Flake is a huge phony and hypocrite. He PROMISED to abide by term limits when he first ran for office. OOPS.....when time ran out  he decided NOT to abide by his term limits promise.  The ONLY thing keeping Jeff Flake from not sleeping is looking at his poll numbers in Arizona. PULEESE.......if his poll numbers showed him winning re-election handily  do you think he would have this moment of conscience....which he NEVER had before??? Give me a break. Jeff Flake is out for Jeff Flake. Pure and simple........,?

11934,ConMan Trump is a fast talking bullshit artist who has so far escaped serious scrutiny for 1) economic policies that will lead to recession  2) foreign policies that will lead to isolation and war  and 3) domestic policies that will lead to an authoritarian state.   Fact: businessmen rarely make good politicians. The last businessman president  Herbert Hoover  led us into the Great Depression. Mitt Romney's only accomplishment as gov of MA was RomneyCare. He left office after 1 term with a 32% approval rating. Today  Sam Brownback  Rick Snyder and Rick Scott are a few of the business men governors who are causing harm to their citizens and state.  ConMan Trump  - encourages violence at his rallies. - spews vulgar  hate filled language at women and minorities. - believes climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese.  The last republican president led us into two major wars and crashed the economy. For more of that - on steroids - vote for ConMan Trump and Make America Hate Again.,?
11935,So what? How about a link to the KKK Grand Wizard or whatever he is supporting Hillary? There are far whatever idiots supporting either one. Quit trying to do what all of you on the left have been trying to do since the 60's. Portray  falsely  that republicans are the party of racists  sexists and any other ists you can think of. Not true now and never has been. You guys on the left are beginning to cause me worry about your mental stability. I sure hope that many of you get some help for your delusional thought processes. I could refer you to some excellent resources  glad to help if I can.,?
11936,When Trump takes A Dump  its on a golden thrown ! He is a Narcissist ! he pays no taxes ! he grabs women's private parts ! He mocks the handicap!  he is a con man  and he just found another loop hole in having tax payers  pay for his spoiled lifestyle.,?
11937,The columnist argues against the academic  writing: "Despite their problems  North American cities are in far better shape than they were two or three decades back. Rather than wringing our hands  we ought to be cheering."  Hello?  Seriously  hello?  Three decades back  people working at local jobs were able to buy a house in Vancouver  Richmond  South Surrey and Toronto  at a price between three and six times the average annual local income.  Today  in 2017  houses in those places are typically selling for DOZENS of times the average annual local income  SHUTTING OUT local workers in a manner never before seen in Canadian history.  Why on Earth is that disastrous catastrophe  the result of massive intake of overseas millionaires through investor immigrant (buy your citizenship) programs  something "we ought to be cheering"?,?
11938,It's the "Juggalo" (google it) subculture. Been here for years  they're annoying  but harmless.,?
11939,In other words  the plan to make us more like Europe will be a step closer.  On the other hand  the Senate might be crafting a bill that will include health savings accounts  the ability to buy health insurance from any carrier  anywhere in the country and other features not purposely excluded from Obamacare because they will lower costs and won't force us into single payer.,?

11944,Like the simpleton that you appear to be; life isn't all about money.  BC had the best economy in Canada  and the free enterprise coalition that created it  was tossed to the side of the road for doing nothing but focus on the economy.  Same as Harper; when you only have one single platform; to bow down to the foreign corporations  you quickly run out of support and lose the race.,?
11945,The earth heals itself  to think otherwise is uneducated  shortsighted and outright stupid. Do some research before posting stupid crap "Researchers".  But besides that  we all think pollution stinks  but don't post hypocritical BS.,?
11946,1) You have no way of knowing that no mass shooter was conservative. It's part of your silly delusion that all conservatives are noble and all liberals are evil. Liberals don't shoot up Planned Parenthood clinics. Liberals don't shoot up churches that have black members. Liberals don't shoot up gay nightclubs. 2) Republicans use mental illness as a talking point only. Trump's budget CUTS funding for mental illness.,?
11947,Sarah   I think your thinking is filled with "pathetic".  You are opening your mouth and inserting your foot.,?
11948,I wonder why Winnipeg has the highest and most violent crime rate in Canada?,?
11949,Where did this insulting stereotype come from? The black-as-criminal image has been with us at least since the nineteenth century  when explicit racism portrayed African American slaves’ essential nature as ignorant and savage  in need of the “civilizing” influence of the white man.  At that time little black crime actually occurred  as slaves’ lives were rigorously controlled  and they could be and often were swiftly put to death for perceived offenses against the slave owners  who acted as judge  jury  and executioner.   On average  an African American man  woman  or child was hanged  generally by a white mob  once a week  every week between 1882 and 1930  as police actively participated or stood by and condoned the murders.  Lynchings continued until the 1950s  as thousands of black Americans were hanged for offenses like “disputing with a white man.”,?
11950,In every country where full face covering are common (without exception)  there is no freedom of expression (including religious satire)  no gender equality  and no freedom of sexual orientation.  How can any country be taken seriously when people are killed for "blasphemy" based on the interpretations of an illiterate warlord (who was enlightened through the whispers of archangel Gabriel (and Gabriel only speaks Arabic?)). People are free to worship whoever they want but the idea that Saudi Arabia or any other of the 57 members of the OIC are beacons of gender equality is absolutely ridiculous.  Women are treated equally in Saudi Arabia  they just can't drive? And women in Iran are treated equally  they just get beaten when in breach of the "morality codes"?  As   Hitchens would say  don't waste my time.,?
11951,There isn't enough money to close the gap by taxing income and sales.  For this level of government your PFD is shrinking,?
11952,We should be having referendums about a lot of crap  both truedopes and cretin and martin foisted on True Canadians. The Real Men and Women of Canada.  Both this little commie dick-tator wanna be hasn't the stones.,?
11953,Just don't believe Selfie Boy when he says he is here to help these families who have or want to have children.  He is about to unleash a tax assault in the next budget (mostly by stealth so that those non-educated in finance and economics won't even notice)  which will likely force Canada into a competitive disadvantage for investment and entrepreneurship  and the job creation potential that comes with it.,?
11954,Our favorite Trump supporter on again with his post truth blather.  The subsidy is to the power producer (usually owned by Big Oil) not the gas supplier.,?
11955,Somehow  I suspect if Trump had said one of the great things about being a star is you can grab men by the a*****e anytime you want  it would seem simple to people who don't have p*****s too.,?
11956,All of this is going to require that governments tax the people who have money---simple. People don't need millions of dollars a year and no one contributes as much either to society or to their organization as the compensation of CEOs would suggest. And no one earns that kind of money in a vacuum. There are always other people in the organization whose work is just as essential as that of the CEO. So  it is perfectly legitimate to tax their wealth to pay for the needs of the society that supports them.,?
11957,Sometimes it seems that the primary purpose of labor unions is to whine.  Union leaders like Dr Schwartz have little concept of big business finance.  The "profits" generated by Sacred Heart amount to surplus cash that is needed to invest in new equipment/technology  cash reserves and to service debt.  No profit = no new equipment.   Does anyone want to guess what the payments are on the  $567 million mortgage for RiverBend???   Anyone want to guess how much a new MRI or a new CT scanner costs?  How about $2-3 million?  Maybe some of the RiverBend profits are supporting a different PeaceHealth facility that is LOSING money?   The annual cash flow statement for Sacred Heart would provide a clear picture of where the "profits" are being utilized.    Without it  Dr Schwartz can only speculate and accuse.   Were I Dr Schwartz  I would be praising the business acumen of PeaceHealth.  Nothing like a healthy cash flow for job security.,?
11958,There aren't enough bears on the entire planet to explain our fecal load. It's far more likely to be the hundreds of thousands of leaking and otherwise failed septic "systems". Of course this isn't new in Oregon. EWEB  originally the Eugene Water Board  was formed in response to a massive cholera outbreak that was due to the raw sewage dumped into the Willamette  a practice that didn't formally end until the 1980s.,?
11959,And as a candidate  President elect  and now President  what "civility" standard as Mr. Trump met??? sheesh.,?
11960,Typical unimportant “fake news”.  We got Donald Trump and god on our side!  We don’t need nobody else!  Imua,?
11961,I guess the only ? you have to ask is   are they cheap prostitutes for the oil industry or expensive ones.  Still no difference  they make there money doing the same thing. .,?
11962,Russia "tried" to mess with our elections  but no evidence they succeeded as many Dems would like us to believe.  We mess with other countries elections too so don't get your nose too high up in the air.  We have "universal car insurance in Hawaii?"  So why are 16% of vehicles involved in traffic accidents in Hawaii uninsured?,?
11963,When the CBC gets more than the paltry viewership than they do now then maybe we can talk about increased funding. Until then they really service an elite small segment at high cost.,?
11964,Check your facts.  The White House is being repaired so the President had to move out.  It is a working vacation with Cabinet and staff present and business is being conducted.,?
11965,Not this Canadian  the payout was disgraceful and disgusting...,?
11966,The black box is opening faster than most would admit.  It seems perfectly reasonable for close relatives to make a decision on MAID when their spouse/parent is incompetent. But I've seen the emotional turmoil that relatives go through trying to care for a dependent spouse or parent in Long Term Care. Expecting them to make a decision on MAID as well will cause huge conflicts within families.  And if family members can make the decision  what about suffering patients who have no family? Why  the public trustee could make the decision.  Now we have the government making a decision to kill a citizen.  ....And we're back to Germany in 1920  when doctors were authorised to euthanise those with "lives not worthy of living". There were precautions to prevent abuse - three doctors had to agree. Nevertheless  very quickly the death rate in some psychiatric hospitals reached 25%. This was all in place before a little-known private from WWI seized power and ripped the lid off the black box.,?
11967,The US senate just gave our blood-bloated military another $600 BILLION to bomb and terrorize children abroad yet we can't afford basic services to help our children at home. Why do we permit this and encourage it by voting in warmongers? The message is clear to our children -- settle your differences with violence  even murdering innocents and writing it off as "collateral damage." After 15 years and $7 TRILLION have we come any closer to that goal by fighting terror with terror? Are our streets and homes any safer or our people better off? We are ruled by morons and monsters.,?
11968,Begich is a idiot and a clown,?
11969,Another idiot!,?
11970,Time to move on then  Lilly! How many years gone the Times died? But you still have PJ to spoon you the truth....,?
11971,Hey pal  it's LGBTQ2S  not LGBTQQ2S - what sort of homophobic monster are you?,?
11972,Good god our mealy mouthed idiotic press is going to be the death of this country.  If ever we needed a tough adversarial press to stop playing the both sides do it horserace game  now would be the time.  I mean this editorial looks like it was written at Breitbart or Fox News.    Have you learned nothing since your participation in the Clinton "emails" debacle led directly towards the election of the most dangerous and incompetent President this country has ever seen?,?
11973,"We worried that Trump administration political appointees would block the Fish and Wildlife Service from protecting any species" Just had to have at least one negative Trump statement in the article didn't you?As if Trump is against all wildlife. Just silly.,?
11974,Wow! you must be crushed Sheep. One of Trumps hand picked advisers is a liar.  And now he is made to fall on his sword. Gosh ... no one saw this coming. Then again  it is a very dark place where your head currently resides.,?
11975,I hope there aren't any stupid few Canarians who say the mountain is sacred. The few lolo Hawaiians ruin it for the many Hawaiians. Did I say the few lolo Hawaiians ruin it for the many Hawaiians?,?
11976,The question is who is this person applauding your logical fallacy?,?
11977,All music was "contemporary" at one time  no matter how old or young it may be. What matters is how it touches the heart and soul of the listener.  I personally knew Archbishop Sample when he was a seminarian and visited with him and had lunch with him in Rome while he was studying Canon Law at the North American Seminary in the mid 90s. He was a great pastor at his first parish in Bark River  MI. But I must say that his time in Rome studying Canon Law changed him considerably.,?
11978,Drama much ?,?
11979,Jordan uh-hum woyzeck   Although this must be an embarrassing time  trolling only makes one look more desperate and pathetic.,?
11980,Where did you hear it's "interest free"?  I never read that.,?
11981,A completely uninformed and ignorant comment hawn !,?
11982,Thank you for proving with every post that what I say is true. People like you are the best thing that ever happened to the Republican Party  Peter.,?
11983,How does anyone know if she had a helmet on or not!!! None of you know nothing about it!! Just stay out of it!! Be a grownup and stay out of it!   Don't you people know her family is  in pain!! This crap needs to stop!! If you have nothing nice to say about my niece!!!  Then just SHUT UP!!! I love you Heather! My God keep you with him!!  Love your auntie Candy!,?
11984,As I keep saying  you can't fix stupid.,?
11985,Give it up DUFFY! You knew from day one what you thought you could get away with  hide  embellish  and just screw the ultimate taxpayer for your gross expenses. You were guilty then   your are guilty now and will always be a damn crook!!,?
11986,only a sunny leftist progressive would think we do not need military spending that suck up blah blah blah because we are under the American military umbrella for which we are gratefully anti-American (the Left anyway) and morally superior to the americans,?
11987,Tony Romo career starting W/L record: 80-53. So he has won 80 meaningful games at least and at least 80 more than you have.,?
11988,my god you are stupid  obama signed off on it with holder!,?
11989,That is a sick comment. You should be ashamed of that.,?
11990,What the media needs to hammer on are the impacts after they pass it. Numbers of people uninsured. Amount of money transferred to the billionaire class. The still rising cost of healthcare. And the utter failure to address huge problems like senior care and the opioids epidemic.   We can't stop Dan Sullivan from voting for it. But we can sure hold him and Don Young accountable for the results when they try to get reelected.,?
11991,Can you at least read the column before weighing in with the usual BSABSVR comment? Is that too much to ask?,?
11992,Bottom line:  Priests aren't trusted  therefore by your logic  all Catholics should be assumed pedophiles and treated as such.  Sounds reasonable.,?
11993,Proving a negative is impossible and stupid. If you make a statement such as that your god exists  the burden is on you to prove it.,?
11994,Do these idiots realize how outnumbered they are?,?
11995,Of course predator control is not the only tool in game management  as you mention  habitat development also helps.  In the vast and remote areas of Alaska though  habitat development can be prohibitively expensive  and comes with other associated risks  while predator control can be a fast and economical response to population shifts  and can be implemented by sport hunting. Predator prey relationships are complex and difficult to study due to cost constraints and lack of experimental control. That's why game management should be left to those who best know the ecology of the state. Young's bill says the land should be managed by the state (ADF&G)  and that they should have the same tools on federal as state lands. ADF&G is a responsible organization with many highly qualified ecologists.  Based on the simple fact of their mandate and funding  they have more data than any other group to make responsible game management decisions in Alaska  including the use of predator control.,?
11996,to protest such is meaningless stupidity of the left period. its not thier busines to know anyones tax returns prior to being elected into office.    and please save the stupidity  this is left wing period  get over it regardless of how many times you post your drivel we see thru you left wingnuts.. if there is anything wrong the irs will deal with issues  as for the russian bs again  grow up and get into reality,?
11997,I am always amazed how people are so easily manipulated by a news story.  It wasn't the banks that brought down the housing market  they issued loans under regulations put in place during the slick-Clinton Administration under the purview of the incompetent-Bush Administration.  Then under the dishonest-Obama Administration everyone (Wall Street) was made whole though quantitative easing.  No one went to jail and those tiny little fines were nothing more than annoying mosquito bites to those banks and investment firms.  Only a foolish person would believe this appointment is any different than what has been offered under the last three or four previous administrations.  Sorry Tony_T  those keys were handed out a long time ago and we have been watching Wall Street raking in the dough ever since.,?
11998,You're an idiot Jarin,?
11999,These people are from a country where corruption and fleecing the government are considered to be virtues. They need to be given long prison sentences to send a message to their fellow countrymen contemplating bamboozling the stupid Americans.,?
12000,This headline reads like something off the LPC website  not a national newspaper that should be holding our leaders to account.,?
