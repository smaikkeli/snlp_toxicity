<|startoftext|><|0|> absolutely correct . the facts are that no country can get an efficient and effective health care system through a series of government monopolies . canada s spending on health care is pretty much in line with what europeans spend but we get longer wait times and far less coverage . what s the difference ? every repeat every european county has a mix of public and private health care coverage both in insurance coverage and in delivery . we need that . the romeno report was suppose to fix health care . . .it didn t . in fact we have all the same problems now that we had when chretien hired romeno to whitewash structural problems in the system . the kirby report made far more sense but was ignored by chretien as he didn t like the results . so ? we have lost years of improvements due to politics and ideology . <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|><|0|> interestingly enough two gop strategist who don t support trump pointed out two possibilities . . steve schmidt who was mccain s campaign manager predicted the gop would split along similar lines as you see in britain with the gop being the mainstream centre right party like the british conservatives and a new alt right party would form where the trump supporters would go much like ukip in britain and despite this split the tories still won as that made them more acceptable to more moderates off course labour veering far to the left which he left out also probably helped too . . another rick wilson stated the gop is damaged goods so he is hoping to start a new conservative party that would focus on conservative values but would be open to minorities many who are conservative but don t want to be part of a racist party and this could reach out to conservative americans who the gop has burned bridges with . <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|><|0|> steve my claim that the us medical not health care system is the best is based on frequent references to people travelling to the us for treatment . yes the us health care system is probably the worst . not surprising . there is no connection between the medical system and million pre obama americans . outcome is certain to be poor . make that connection and the results are certain to improve . another point is the performance of government run systems not just health care . the communists showed that government running everything does not work . many countries using public sector health care including canada have troubles . with health care in the private sector everyone choses their own level of health care . you select what you can pay for . those who cannot pay even the lowest level would need help . financing this would be possible from all the funds not needed for people who pay their own way . us data suggests that only of the population would need help . <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|><|0|> income on business savings is currently taxed . what is being proposed is a punitive tax as if it were paid out to a high wage earner . then when it is actually paid out in wage dividend or sale of company it is taxed again . you are right that a large pool of working capital is a bit like an rrsp for businesses . unlike an rrsp its earnings are taxed immediately at the small business rate . but like an rrsp most of the tax is deferred until it is pay out to owners . unlike an rrsp it is available to the company at any time for business purposes similar to withdrawing k from an rrsp to buy a first house but way more flexible . a punitive tax on working capital income would incentivize owners to withdraw it and invest in rrsp s instead . this would make their companies less flexible and have a significant impact on business investment . <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|><|0|> ryan is operating from a naive approach to the budget that would have states raise all their revenue directly without federal assistance . interestingly the great recession demonstrated that states who were not afraid of raising property tax rates had no service interuptions while those that would not based on a conservative ideology fared poorly . health care reform primarily benefits the medical community . it makes sure they get paid and that their customers don t die without their services . single payer would be better although it would force price cuts cost cuts happen all the time to squeeze out more profit . the taxes on the wealthy in the aca come from a promise by obama not to raise taxes on the bottom . it would have been better to have a more general levy which eventually must come with single payer . i like that the bishops have come forward . lacing the bill with stupak amendment language did not deter them . <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|><|0|> i find it interesting that the coverage of this decision approaches the issue as the actions of one man donald trump . yet barack obama s decision to join the paris accord was the decision of just one man . because it is not a treaty with specific goals or consequences and is really just voluntary there was no need for the u .s . congress to debate or approve this decision . as a matter of fact it was specifically designed this way so that the elected representatives in the u .s . congress would have no input on the decision . similarly the liberals weren t specific about the costs of their climate policy goals during our last election . this is what is troubling if the liberals had said they were going to introduce a carbon tax that would cost in the neighbourhood of per family by how many votes might this have cost them ? it s what many people find troubling about the arrogance of our political class of all types . <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|><|0|> thanks for the reminder . in this day and age we don t talk about tobacco much anymore . that s one of the worst habits . while it s use has declined its not declined nearly enough . at every intersection with a stop light smokers dump their butts out . that s pathetic . everyone knows it shortens one s life but they do it anyway . our goal should be to reduce and end alcohol tobacco and drug use . it s odd that drug supporters point to how prohibition didn t work as though that was some sort of a victory for society . when in reality given the millions of deaths from it many of whom were innocent victims the destroyed families and lives making alcohol legal was perhaps the worst mistake we ever made . i take a lot of heat for speaking out against drugs when you d think people would appreciate i m looking out for our kids . adults put their quest to get high because they can t accept daily life without drugs ahead of whats best for kids and society as a whole . <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|><|0|> the problem with rail is that it is not and never the only alternative mode for avoiding traffic . yes in chapter of the environmental impact study an alternative to rail considered was an elevated guideway identical to rail except that buses and high occupancy vehicles would be running on it instead of trains . it was summarily dismissed as not meeting purpose and need . and the eis falsely considered it more costly than rail . falsely because the eis deliberately omitted the fact that with rail billions more were needed after cost of the guideway trains steel rail and the yearly subsidies for rail added to the existing yearly subsidies for buses and handicap vans . there is no more need today for at grade rail in honolulu simply because honolulu traffic congestion is easily handled by replacing traffic lights with a modern system as is done in meadowlands new jersey where vehicles passed thru the area each day . <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|><|0|> to hear the city tell it the citizens of eugene have acknowledged the choice between growing the city vertically and growing it out in area socal style . apparently a majority of us would prefer to not live in a socal style region with cars and exhaust everywhere and most of the space dedicated to those cars . if so then we acknowledge that many most of the suburban style single family homes will eventually be replaced with taller buildings and that we will revamp our transportation system to offer fewer amenities like free parking to cars . the city is correct that the citizens want to grow up and that sentiment was until very recently driven largely by the folks on the south side . it s funny to me how they support densification as long as it happens elsewhere and doesn t affect them in any way . clearly this city needs to grow up in more ways than one . <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|><|0|> i believe that you like most americans conflate social license with civil rights . a civil right is about the relationship between the individual and the government . i can exercise my civil right to freedom of speech and it means that the government at all levels of government in the us cannot arrest or prosecute me or confiscate my property for exercising my right . an american s right to free speech however is not a social license . it doesn t mean there will be no social consequences to what we say or write . we can be criticized divorced evicted from the store the job the park etc . for the things we say and write . but the government still can t arrest us . you falsely equate mr . kaepernick s act of protesting undeniable racial injustice that still exists for many americans with you having the freedom to criticize him for his act of protest and you re only half correct . yes you can criticize mr . kaepernick and we won t call the police or the military . <|endoftext|>
